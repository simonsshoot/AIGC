This is an incredibly apt summary of Trump\u2019s life to date. Idolatry, greed, and sexual immorality are intertwined in individual lives and whole societies. Sexuality is designed to be properly ordered within marriage, a relationship marked by covenant faithfulness and profound self-giving and sacrifice. To indulge in sexual immorality is to make oneself and one\u2019s desires an idol. That Trump has been, his whole adult life, an idolater of this sort, and a singularly unrepentant one, should have been clear to everyone.\n \n\u201cAnd therefore it is completely consistent that Trump is an idolater in many other ways. He has given no evidence of humility or dependence on others, let alone on God his Maker and Judge. He wantonly celebrates strongmen and takes every opportunity to humiliate and demean the vulnerable. He shows no curiosity or capacity to learn. He is, in short, the very embodiment of what the Bible calls a fool.\u201d \nSpeak Truth to Trump"

Since her area of research was communism in Vietnam, she marked the picnic spot with a communist flag tied to a large shrub in the front of her housing complex. It was pretty easy to drive past her place as it was right next to a freeway exit and kind of tucked away. Something large and striking was definitely necessary, and all of her students would have realized that it was hers immediately. In fact, I remember a few of us chuckling over it upon arriving.

By this time our professor and a few others came down to try and get the flag back.\n \n\u201cYOU CAN\u2019T FLY THIS FLAG IN AMERICA! IF YOU\u2019RE GOING TO FLY THIS FLAG IN AMERICA, YOU\u2019VE GOTTA FLY THE AMERICAN FLAG ABOVE IT!\u201d\n \nHoo boy. Our professor calmly told the lady why the flag was there and asked for it back. I should mention that the capslock is entirely warranted. She was yelling at us the entire time.\n \n\u201cMY DADDY DIDN\u2019T FIGHT IN IWO JIMA SO YOU COULD FLY THIS FLAG IN AMERICA.\u201d\n \nI\u2019m sorry\u2026what? We were all history buffs, if not history majors, so we all knew that the battle of Iwo Jima had very little to do communism.\n \n\u201cMY GRANDFATHER BUILT THIS HOUSE.\u201d (She pointed to the house behind her, which was next to the housing complex my professor lived in. What any of this had to do with her grandfather or the house, we had no idea.) \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T FLY THE RUSSIAN COMMUNIST FLAG IN AMERICA.\u201d\n \nMy professor switched tacks. \u201cThat\u2019s actually not the Soviet Communist flag. It\u2019s-\u201d\n \n\u201cYOU CAN\u2019T FLY A CHINESE COMMUNIST FLAG IN AMERICA. MY DADDY AND HIS BROTHERS DIDN\u2019T FIGHT IN IWO JIMA SO YOU COULD FLY THIS FLAG HERE.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s not the Chinese Communist flag.\u201d\n \n\u201cTHEN WHAT IS IT?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s the International Communist Party flag. Could I please have my property back, ma\u2019am?\u201d\n \n\u201cNO! I\u2019M GOING TO RIP YOUR FLAG UP AND PUT IT IN THE TRASH!\u201d\n \nWith this she storms off, leaving her slightly horrified husband/partner/relative/whoever he was standing there holding a bag of groceries. He apologized. My professor told him again that we were just using it to mark our picnic spot and she really just wanted it back. He promised to get it back to her.\n \nWe students were just kind of dazed. I think a few of us exchanged shocked glances and statements of disbelief like \u201cWhat does Iwo Jima have to do with this??? World War II wasn\u2019t really about fighting communism???\u201d (Well, kind of\u2026)\n \nThen, suddenly, the lady re-emerged carrying a very large American flag on a pole, started waving it around and declared to us:\n \n\u201cTHIS IS THE ONLY FLAG THAT SHOULD BE FLYING IN AMERICA. IF YOU\u2019RE GOING TO FLY A COMMUNIST FLAG, YOU BETTER FLY THIS FLAG ABOVE IT!\u201d\n \nOh lordy.\n \nIf I recall correctly, at this point she went back to ranting more about World War II, how much she hated communists, and her relatives who fought in whatever wars. But we were done. The professor said a few words to the man about getting her flag back and we retreated back to our picnic where we tried to process whatever the hell that was.\n \nThat woman gets my vote for the most ignorant person I\u2019ve ever met in America.\n \nI didn\u2019t really expect her to know the difference between the International Communist Party flag or the Russian Communist flag, but like many folks of her type she didn\u2019t seem to understand the basic definition of free speech. We had every right to fly that flag, whether we were actually communists or just using to mark our picnic. Nor is there is a stipulation that we fly an American flag above it.\n \nOh, and the American fighting in the Pacific Theater in World War II didn\u2019t have a whole lot to do with communism. Her father was fighting the Japanese Imperialists, and the Japanese Imperialists were just as anti-communist as we were/are.\n \nEdit/Note for future commenters: A lot of folks have already mentioned flying the Nazi flag as a comparison to what my professor did by flying a communist flag. You don\u2019t really need to mention it again. Besides, I disagree that a communist flag provokes the same sort of offense and feeling that a Nazi flag does. Perhaps this is heavy bias on my part considering my personal family history. And now you know why I kind of wish you\u2019d stop bringing up the Nazi flag all the time.\n \nA lot of folks have also made the argument that I would get equally mad upon seeing an offensive flag flying in my neighborhood. Well, actually I do have an offensive flag flying in my neighborhood (a Confederate flag) and I do nothing about it. I\u2019d love to get the owner to take it down, but there\u2019s very few ways to do that without starting a fight or making him want to keep displaying it. It\u2019s awful, and I think it\u2019s a terrible thing for the kids in our neighborhood to have to view everyday, especially the kids of color who live really close by."

And I would if I were.\n \nBack in the day, my dad, my brothers, and I were in love with those toys, GI Joe, and another brand named \u201cElite Force\u201d, and we used to collect everything we found. Guns, uniforms, soldiers, pilots, etc.\n \nTSA: \u201c\nSorry, sir, it clearly says that we can\u2019t allow you to board the plane with guns\n\u201d.\n \nSo, after a heated argument between my dad and her, regarding the difference and similitudes between guns and toys shaped like guns, she told my dad that he needed to take them out of the packaging, talk with the airline, and, if still allowed, take them as checked baggage.\n \nLong story short, since we were in a hurry, my father reluctantly put those toys in a common plastic bag, ran over to the check-in counters and back, and boarded the plane in justified anger.\n \nWe thought those toys were gonna disappear (\nif suitcases with padlocks are often illegally opened, what\u2019s a plastic bag full of toys\n?)\n, \nso we gave up on them early. They did arrive a couple of days later, though.\n \nMaybe it was ignorance, maybe it was stupidity, maybe it was both; maybe they were real orders. But what an ignorant, stupid person \nand \norder. The disappointment and frustration of that experience are still there."

Doesn\u2019t matter if you major in chem or philosophy or women\u2019s studies, you have to take this class. While it ostensibly focuses on basic college-level reading and writing (lots of writing to prompts, reading short passages and analyzing them, etc.), the TAs who taught it also took it as an opportunity to get everyone in the college environment engaged in critical thought about the world at large. The class met 4x per week, and every other Thursday we had a seminar discussion on an assigned reading\u2026just a time to discuss and argue ideas presented, sometimes about controversial topics.\n \nOne seminar focused on an article that argued that countries with \u201cbiblically-based\u201d (meaning the christian bible, largely the new testament, but with a lot of talk about the \u201c10 commandments\u201d\u2026I KNOW\u2026take what you like from the old!) laws suffered less crime than those with laws based on other philosophies. It was a fine and, actually, well-written article, but it was clearly assigned with the intention to rile up debate. Most of the students in the seminar said they disagreed with the article, citing the weakness of the conclusions (the author did stretch on what was considered \u201cbiblically-based law\u201d) and ignoring certain societies that are less violent than, say, the US, but have certain laws that would go against the modern, christian bible (say, free access to abortion or civil partnerships for gay couples (this was long enough ago that only the Netherlands had, at that point, provided full marriage equality)). One student was sitting quietly and looking like he was about to burst at his seams as the discussion carried on, until the TA noticed, and asked him to share his thoughts.\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know why we\u2019re even arguing this. Everyone believes in the bible. Maybe they think that it doesn\u2019t prohibit gay marriage or abortion, but they all believe in it. We\u2019re just arguing what the 10 commandments mean, not whether everyone believes them. Why are we arguing whether biblical laws are correct? Everyone agrees they are, we just differ on what they mean!\u201d\n \nTA: \u201cAre you talking about the christian bible? The new testament?\u201d\n \nStudent: \u201cYeah, all that stuff. Old and new. I know a lot of the old testament rules don\u2019t apply anymore, but the basic stuff everyone believes in. The 10 commandments, love thy neighbor, jesus dying on the cross\u2026everyone believes all that, so why are we fighting over it?\u201d\n \nTA: \u201cWould you be surprised to learn that most of the world\u2019s people don\u2019t believe in or follow the christian bible? Do you know anyone who\u2019s jewish?\u201d\n \nStudent: \u201cI don\u2019t think I do, but I know about jews\u2026they believe basically the same things, but they don\u2019t have christmas. It\u2019s kind of like methodists versus baptists, right?\u201d\n \nTurns out this student had grown up in a small town and had never met anyone who wasn\u2019t a fairly traditional christian. He *literally* believed that everyone in the world was a christian of some sort. A jewish classmate explained to him the similarities and differences between christianity and judaism, an agnostic student explained to him how he had grown up with no religion at all, but had a vague notion of a \u201chigher power.\u201d Our TA found a muslim to come talk to the class about islam. And, a few weeks later, I found the moxie to stand up and tell the class about how I had chosen atheism (I was raised catholic). At the end of that class, a man who had never met anyone who didn\u2019t share his faith traditions had heard from people who practiced several other faiths as well as none, and gotten to know us on a personal level in the process.\n \nHe was \u201cignorant\u201d about the religions (and lack of) around the world, but, to his credit, was willing to listen and learn. When he first claimed that \u201ceveryone believes in the bible,\u201d I found his ignorance stunning. But his grace in being willing to learn more was inspiring.\n \nAnd, yes, I do think this is a lesson for many people in these troubling times in the U.S. and elsewhere. We were stunned at his comments, at first, but heard him out, asked him to elaborate, and offered him the chance to learn. We didn\u2019t shout him down and tell him he was wrong, full stop. He *was* wrong, but the path to getting him to understand that wasn\u2019t ridicule and exclusion, but rather including him and educating him. And, of course, MEETING people in the groups he didn\u2019t understand. Studies show that those who, say, are anti-gay-marriage tend to soften if not reverse their views once they meet and befriend someone who is gay. I can\u2019t imagine this progression of views is that different when people meet and get to know someone who is muslim, an immigrant, etc."

But the best was a family called the Canterburys who lived between us and Joe.\n \nThe Canterbury family consisted of a woman and her two teenage daughters. I think there was a father somewhere but we never saw him so he was either permanently drunk/stoned in their apartment or in jail.

I asked her what the problem was with moving over there? Was it the economy and how expensive some things were over there? No. Was it being so far from family? No. Was it because they had to board pets in quarantine for a while (I couldn't remember if they had pets)? No.\n \nAfter I finally ran out of reasons why the move could be so traumatic, I flat out asked her.

That's cool, plan on doing a little traveling on the way to Hawaii?

She was also worried about learning a new language... she didn't believe me that English was the primary language spoken there.\n \nHeh.\n \nI ran into her randomly last year in the DC area and asked if they ever managed to get in some foreign travel since they already had their passports (because of course she went got them since I was clearly wrong).

Sarah Palin made the mistake of claiming that Eureka College, which is in Illinois, was in California.\n \"This is Reagan country. Yeah! And perhaps it was destiny that the man who went to California's Eureka College would become so woven within and inter-linked to the Golden State.\" \nDoh?\n \nIn 2010, Sarah Palin referred to Kodiak Island as the largest island in the United States. \n\"As we work and sightsee on America's largest island, we'll get to view more majestic bears, so now is a good time to draw attention to the political equivalent of the species.\u201d \nSorry Sarah, but that would be Hawaii, and what is the \u201cpolitical equivalent of species?\u201d\n \n\u201cHey, the more they\u2019re pouring it on, the more I\u2019m going to bug the crap out of them by being out there, with a voice, with the message, Hopefully running for office in the future too \u2026 Bless their hearts, those haters out there. They don\u2019t understand that it invigorates me. It wants me to get out there and defend the innocent\u2026\u201d\n \nWhile at a motorcycle rally in 2011. Sarah Palin dropped this unforgettable quote,\n \u201c\nI love that smell of the emissions!\u201d \nHow about the taste? A little viscous and salty, I hear.\n \n\u201cMaybe our kids could be defended against criminals on the spot if more Mama Grizzlies carried [guns]. And [the] Obama administration wants you ID\u2019d for that? Well, then go ahead and carry a sign too. A sign that says \u2018Yeah, I carry a gun because a cop is too heavy.\u2019\u201d Then, \nsaying that creating gun-free zone schools and other public buildings is \u201cstupid on steroids.\u201d\n Yes, she\u2019s truly an expert on stupid.\n \nIn 2011, while, on the O\u2019Reilly Factor, Sarah Palin was asked how she\u2019d fix the Oil spill in the Gulf. Her insightful response was, \n\u201cThe Dutch and the Norwegians, they are known for dikes and for cleaning up water and for dealing with spills.\u201d\n \nIn 2010, while, on the Glenn Beck Show, Palin was asked how she would deal with rising tensions between North and South Korea. Her response, \n\"\nBut obviously, we've got to stand with our North Korean allies.\"\n \nAnd my personal favorite: In 2011, when asked about Paul Revere\u2019s midnight ride, Palin had this to say. \n\"He who warned, uh, the British that they weren't gonna be takin' away our arms, uh, by ringing those bells, and um, makin' sure as he's riding his horse through town to send those warning shots and bells that we were going to be sure and we were going to be free, and we were going to be armed.\"\n \nMs. Palin is a stunning example of the \n\u201cDunning-Kruger Effect\u201d\n in action, which basically maintains that \nthere are people so stupid that they don\u2019t even realize they are stupid\n, and see themselves as clever.\n \n\u201cThe Dunning\u2013Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which low-ability individuals suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their ability as much higher than it really is. Dunning and Kruger attributed this bias to a metacognitive incapacity, on the part of those with low ability, to recognize their ineptitude and evaluate their competence accurately.\u201d \nDunning\u2013Kruger effect - Wikipedia\n \nSee also: \nThe Psychological Quirk That Explains Why You Love Donald Trump\n \nNuff said? \u201cYou Betcha!\u201d"

There\u2019s nothing better for America than women being back in the kitchen, barefoot and pregnant.\u201d The man is so close, he\u2019s spitting in my face. The more I step back, the more he steps towards me.\n \nSTUPID doesn\u2019t begin to cover it.\n \nI looked at him and told him he was dumb as F**k and he needed to educate himself. And that sent him into spasms all over again.\n \nHow dare I speak to him that way? How dare I use that word? Who did I think I was? This man was like acting like a demon possessed.\n \nAnd so, I said it again. I couldn\u2019t help it; I started to laugh. And I laughed and laughed and laughed. I told him to step back and to stay away as I walked to my car. And I just kept on laughing. The entire episode was ludicrous.\n \nI had talked with plenty of conservatives during that time and while they were passionate, they weren\u2019t like THIS. I knew within seconds this wasn\u2019t a person I could have a meaningful conversation with. Nor did I even want to.\n \nThis was the first time I was fully confronted with people who live in this alternate reality and it showed me just how bad they really are. It\u2019s scary to think this kind of thinking actually exists in our society. But it does and to make sure the rest of us know it, they voted for Trump."

I generally don\u2019t try to change people\u2019s opinions on one of their core beliefs, and since she wasn\u2019t saying Nico should die or anything, I did the reasonable thing. I tried to start a discussion on it.\n \n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n \n\u201cPeople are supposed to reproduce.\u201d This was the typical beginning to a decent argument I\u2019ve heard before, so I expected her to start saying that. Instead, she said, \u201cYou can\u2019t have babies unless you\u2019re married.\u201d \nUhhh\u2026 What?!\n \n\u201cActually, people who are just dating can have a kid too.\u201d I was also going to explain that gay marriage is now legal.\n \n\u201cNo they can\u2019t.

You don\u2019t get it. We should just stop.\u201d\n \nShe later proceeded to go on a rant about how we didn\u2019t need plastic or any synthetic materials to maintain our present society the way it is. She also related a series of pretty questionable laws of physics (that is to say, completely and obviously false). In addition, she told us that scientists today had the technology to \u201cmagically change the atoms in metal into some sort of big atom that makes up a car that can move on its own\u201d without requiring any sort of energy to move it (or wheels, for that matter). I believe she also declared butter did not contain oil. Yes, she did indeed say \u201cmagically\u201d.\n \nPerhaps her parents simply have not told her these things yet. She had clearly gone through puberty, though, so I don\u2019t know why.\n \nI don\u2019t meet a lot of ignorant people, as I generally am surrounded by my rather intelligent, philosophical friends, so maybe she isn\u2019t very ignorant. She\u2019s just the most ignorant one I know."

I also try hard not to make assumptions about what people SHOULD know. Different people know different things because they live in different circumstances, have different needs and desires, and so they pay attention to different things.\n \nI was at an antique steam tractor show in Minnesota once. They also had a lot of regular tractors too. I\u2019d bet you most of the people there would fail a geography test. But they could take a broken tractor apart, fix the problem, put it back together, and it would run just fine. That is something MOST people in this world could not do. So who, in this example, should be called ignorant? In my book the people who feed us can be forgiven for the state of their knowledge of geography as long as they keep those tractors running.\n \nOn the other hand there IS appalling ignorance around. Part of it is our failure to properly educate our children in any number of ways. I have a cousin who lives in a nearby town. Her children were not taught anything about World War Two \u201cbecause it might upset them.\u201d And we pass failing kids on to the next grade anyway so that we don\u2019t damage their self-esteem, thus teaching them that they don\u2019t have to learn. Or if a kid is disruptive a teacher cannot just haul him down to the principal\u2019s office any more; the teacher has to call the intervention team while the kid rages on. In my daughter\u2019s high school chemistry class they never once used actual chemicals; it was all \u201cbook learnin\u201d.\n \nI live in Massachusetts in a town reputed to have a very good public school system. One day I went to a grocery store here in my town, grabbed a pair of 99 cent food items which were not taxable so I would pay $1.98 total. The checkout girl was a kid wearing a sweatshirt from the local high school. Anyway I had 98 cents in change so I pulled out a dollar bill and handed it and the 98 cents to her before she told me what I owed. She looked at me incredulously and said, \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d What? \u201cHow did I do what,\u201d I asked in response? \u201cHow did you know how much it would be,\u201d she answered. I honestly don\u2019t remember what I replied, if anything. I wonder how much self esteem she had.\n \nPeople are also ignorant because of TV, the movies, and now the Internet. They use up LOTS of time, time which might otherwise go to learning. And people believe what they see on TV, YouTube, etc, as if it were fact. DIS-education by the Media is very hard in particular on people\u2019s knowledge of science and on critical thinking. I wonder how any of our children ever become engineers or scientists. I can\u2019t even think where to begin on this one\u2026. \n\u201cOMG, radiation from Fukushima has been detected in California. Throw those strawberries in the trash at once!\u201d Inoculations cause autism. Nuclear reactors run as long as the heater is turned on\n \u2026. The good news with these people is that if you sit them down and explain things to them one on one then they will learn, ie ignorance in such people can be overcome with education. But ignorance takes a huge toll because it leads to bad political decisions which affect all of us and the future of our nation and the world. Global Warming, anyone?\n \nLet us not forget those other great forms of entertainment, drugs and alcohol. I am a recovering alcoholic myself. I am fortunate that I did not start drinking until I was out of college. However I hear lots and lots of people at AA meetings who did start drinking and drugging in school, even in elementary school. Their education mostly just stopped. And speaking of ignorance, we didn\u2019t learn anything from the very failed experiment of Prohibition; the \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d just goes on and on\u2026..\n \nWe are also becoming a nation of believers. I am not JUST talking about bible thumpers. Believers go beyond merely ignorant. I am talking about people who \nbelieve\n that something is true and reject all evidence contrary to their belief. Bible thumpers, of course, reject the theory of evolution which they try to have not taught in our schools. But the political left also has its beliefs. For instance, a history book my daughter was given said that the Cultural Revolution in China, one of the greatest slaughters in human history, \u201ccaused a lot of suicides\u201d. And how about the university researcher who studied human intelligence and published a paper stating that intelligence is mostly genetic. Other staff members at that institution tried to have him fired. Those kinds of belief-driven values perpetuate ignorance because such people simply refuse to let knowledge in, and they go out of their way to spread their demonstrably false beliefs to others. Or fire people they disagree with. Oh let us not forget the flat-earth and \u201cNibiru\u201d people either. They are also among the proselytizers of ignorance.\n \nOne final mention since I am married to a teacher. The government keeps interfering with education. I won\u2019t comment on the pros and cons of policies which come down upon teachers from on high, but whether good or bad two facts are inescapable: Complying with all those requirements takes more and more of our teacher\u2019s time, and therefore teachers have less and less time to teach, and what is studied becomes narrower and narrower, clearly a cause of massive ignorance.\n \nSorry for the rant, but there are reasons for the ignorance in this country. We are pretty ignorant about how we raise our children, and ignorance begets ignorance.\nADDENDUM: I want to add Trump supporters to my list of the most ignorant Americans. The more ardent the supporters the more [intentionally] ignorant they have to be to overlook Trump\u2019s criminal behavior, especially the lethally ignorant choices Trump made regarding his COVID-19 \u201cpolicy\u201d. As of today, 5/20/2021, we are approaching 600,000 Americans dead thanks to Trump. His supporters\u2019 refusals to be vaccinated or to even believe that COVID-19 is real (\n*\n) can only push up the number of dead by becoming infected themselves and by spreading the virus to others too.\n \n*\n I actually heard a Trump supporter say that there was no such thing as COVID-19 when I stopped at a convenience store while I traveled west across the US by car just before the 2020 election. The few people standing around him were nodding their heads. On my way back east just after the 2020 election I saw and heard people rejoicing in the streets. Those were MUCH smarter people."

Is one a country and the other a city?\u201d\n \nA long silence before anyone answered.\n \nHer ignorance was even more confounding in the context of the many privileges in her childhood. Her father is a doctor at a prestigious teaching medical school. She grew up in one of the most affluent suburbs of America, attending the best public schools possible \u2014 you know, it\u2019s one of those places where Chinese is taught in public schools. She went to college without a single debt.\n \nAnd here\u2019s the clincher \u2014 she had traveled extensively through Europe after college. She loved to recount how she had traveled for a few months, going from one city to another. It seems that at no point did she look at a map of Europe and consider the possibility of visiting Venice or Vienna, two of the most famous European cities.\n \nLastly, I would like to say how much I hated working with this co-worker and her proud ignorance. I worked in sales that frequently happened over the phone. Often, when I was on the phone with a client, she would eavesdrop (open office and she seemed to have the most amazing hearing \u2014 I suppose to make up for her other deficits), and she would shout out what she thought the answer should be. Of course, it never occurred to her that she was only hearing one side of the conversation and, therefore, her shouted answers were always wrong!"

One of the other students looked at us, very sincerely, and she asked: \u201cWhy are we, like, learning about languages and stuff?\u201d (That\u2019s word for word what she said.)\nYou don\u2019t really notice how noticeable Americans are until you encounter them abroad. The most memorable event was while waiting for a flight in the airport in Lima, Peru, and there was a parade of about 20 Americans with enough luggage to fill the plane themselves. I\u2019d been speaking Spanish for a few months and not really thinking about people back home, so it was a slight culture shock to have this many Americans around again. As they walked past, dragging their many suitcases, one of them turned to the group and said (paraphrased): \u201cOh my god, everyone is speaking Spanish around here!\u201d They clearly were not happy about how Peru wasn\u2019t doing a better job of making them feel more comfortable as annoying tourists. It was very clear that was not an exclamation of excitement about being immersed in a new language and culture, as I might have said it. They were obviously angry.\nIn Puerto Rico, in the capitol building, they have a copy of the constitution of Puerto Rico on display in a glass case. A father and son walk up, and the son looks very interested, trying to read the document. The father pulls him away and sternly says (paraphrased) \u201cNo, that\u2019s the \nSpanish one\n. Where\u2019s the real one?\u201d\nThis one gets honorable mention not because it\u2019s the most ignorant thing I\u2019ve heard but because it was apparently a recurring problem. When I was studying Swahili at a major university, the instructor had to repeatedly remind the students (based on homework I guess, and a couple priceless comments in class) that Africa is a continent and not a single country. This continued into the second year. (It probably didn\u2019t help that they\u2019d talk about things like vague \u201cAfrican culture\u201d in class, but still.)\nAlso, not trying to be picky about word use, but just paying attention to nuances, I\u2019d like to point out that \nignorant\n is a weird word. It just means\n not knowing\n. We\u2019re all incredibly ignorant, of so many things. And while we\u2019d like to learn more, being ignorant in that sense isn\u2019t bad. The objection I have\u2014 and I think how most people usually use the word, especially to say \na person is ignorant,\n rather than being ignorant of something specific\u2014 is when someone appears to be intentionally ignorant, intentionally unaware of things in the world around them, uninterested in learning from others or questioning their assumptions. The most ignorant I\u2019ve ever felt is when starting to study a new language, but it\u2019s an exciting feeling of potential and curiosity, not time to shut off my brain.\n \nUpdate\n: as another \u2018bonus\u2019 I realized there\u2019s something I forgot to mention before that I had intended to include.\n \nMe\n. Or actually all Americans. I\u2019m a relatively educated and curious American who probably knows more than average. But as a habit, we Americans just don\u2019t know some topics very well, such as geography and even our own politics and history. And I know those things fairly well, or at least I thought I did. Then I traveled to some other countries and I found out just how surprisingly much they know. First, of course they know a lot more about their country than I do, sometimes maybe more about their country than I know about mine, and typically world geography too. But more than that,\n they know so much about my country!\n I\u2019m lucky if I can name the president of their country, but they know mine and a number of other government officials, and many past presidents. And they ask questions. Specific questions. I remember one time when I was with a friend in Ecuador, and he was reading a book about Abraham Lincoln. I was living in Illinois at the time when I took this trip, and he immediately connected that Abraham Lincoln was from Illinois. Suddenly he had dozens of questions, most of which I couldn\u2019t answer. And I do know some things about Lincoln. This wasn\u2019t an isolated incident either. So just keep that in mind. Makes you think twice about the idea of an American-knowledge citizenship test that most Americans couldn\u2019t pass but many foreigners, who aren\u2019t planning to take it, could. (Of course I\u2019ve been asked silly questions about America too, if you\u2019re wondering. But less often than you\u2019d think. The best I\u2019ve heard, indirectly, was someone who asked \u201cOh, California? Is that near Hollywood?\u201d. That was in England, so maybe it reaffirms our shared origins.)"

I don't know that they were taught anything at all. They were fourteen, fifteen years old and they could barely read. The teacher would ask them to read a paragraph aloud and they would stammer and sound out words until she took the awful pressure off them and chose someone else. They didn't know basic geography. If you said something about India, they would give you a blank look and say something like, \u201cMy aunt says she\u2019s part Cherokee.\u201d They couldn't do basic math, find Africa on a map or explain to the home ec teacher why bread dough rises. The mean-girl joke at the time was that they knew how to make Popsicle-stick crosses and sing \u201cJesus Loves Me\u201d but not much else.\n \nThis wasn't a fringe religion or an entity like the Amish, who keep isolated schools with rules about how far children are to be educated. This was a mainstream American Protestant religion, which was what was so incredible about it. Maybe the teachers were just completely indifferent and ran it like a daily Sunday school. I have no idea, but I know that it did the girls a real disservice when they joined us.\n \n*in most American high schools, \u201cFreshman\u201d is the first year, or ninth grade."

Because she lived in the village, she spent a lot of time with the families there and especially, the children. She got to know them very well and learned a lot about their lives. The village I lived in was better off financially than the one she lived in.\n \nWe decided to put on a drama with the kids. One day, we were rehearsing, and having trouble as usual because the children were not very disciplined and some really tried to get the best of us. We were rehearsing outside on the top of a small hill. They were not following us quickly when we called to them, and were jumping around and trying to tiptoe through the grass and rocks. I looked down and realized that they were all barefoot.\n \nThe facepalm moment: I asked my friend, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they wearing their shoes?\u201d She said, \u201cMost of them don't have any.\u201d\n \nA pair of flip-flop sandals could be bought for about 100 Rupees, or about 93 cents (American.)

She even organized groups and carpools to drive large groups of students to those protests with her. Every conversation we had at least reference the upcoming war for months.

They were very close knit, everyone knew everyone and they were especially warm and friendly towards me when they found out that I wasn\u2019t from America. However, there\u2019s this willful ignorance in them that they do not give a dam about what\u2019s going on outside of their town, let alone other countries. Heck! most of them have never even been outside of Michigan their entire lives.\n \nWhile I was there, I walked around, shook many hands and talked to many people. And the question that i got asked a few times was: \u201c\nSo do you have 4th of July in your country where you came from?\u201d. \nAt first I didn\u2019t think much of it and politely answered \u201cno\u201d (as in we do not celebrate America\u2019s independence day in my country).\n \nLater it felt a little odd when a middle aged bearded man with a bulging tummy asked me the same question. \u201c\nSo do you have 4th of July in your country where you came from?\u201d.\n Only this time I decided to play dumb and asked him back: \u201c\nno, but what\u2019s 4th of July all about anyway?\u201d. \nTo which he answered: \u201c\nOhhhh! You don\u2019t know? it\u2019s when we all come hang out, drink some beer and watch some fireworks!\u201d. \nIt then struck me that he had no idea what the 4th of July was all about, and no! he wasn\u2019t trying to pull my leg either."

Naturally, lot of rather inexperienced people were recruited, or pushed through the ranks.\n \nIn Houston, we were \u2018hosting\u2019 a team of USCG personnel, who insisted upon checking the whole vessel armed with scary looking weapons, ammo good to go.\n \nThe Captain's feeble attempts at explaining that it wasn't a good idea to consider firing a round while you were aboard a ship loaded with 30 thousand tons of highly explosive propane was met with general derision from the \u2018protectors of American way of life'!!\n \nAnyway, I got tasked with accompanying the team inspecting the deck area. The 3 \u2018coasties' were most interested in ascertaining if I was an Arab. That out of the way, they thawed a bit (I am not Arab, incidentally). The least hostile one then decided to ask me the question I shall never forget.\n \n\u201cSo Mr. Mate, tell me which is the farthest place you have ever been to?\u201d. My jaw dropped! Was he kidding?! No, not at all. An answer was expected of me.\n \n\u201cFrom where?\u201d I ask. Now the coastie is already a bit confused. \u201cEr, you are Indian, right? So which is the farthest place from India you have been to?\u201d\n \n\u201cHere. This place. Houston\u201d, I tell him.\n \nI shall never forget his face. Utter confusion written on it. \u201cHow can this be the farthest place from ANYWHERE? I mean this is Houston, right?! This IS the centre of the world!\u201d\n \nI had multiple experiences of similar kind. I was asked by one security personnel if I was Russian. And I am as Indian looking as is possible! He was friendly. But his \u2018reason for asking' was that there was apparently an active Russian gang around that area indulging in stealing car stereos!! He was just \u2018making sure'!\n \nI am trying not to generalize. Maybe it had to do with the fact that I was a sailor on high risk ships. We met the same kind of security personnel every time we sailed into US. Calling US ports in those days would always leave a metallic taste in every sailor's mouth."

This is due to the survivor being a Hungarian Jew, a county which Adolf most likely never went to unless he traveled there in his youth. Also, the Holocaust Survivor was imprisoned in a work camp and Hitler never visited the work camps. The holocaust survivor was also 5 at the time. That means unless Hitler lied and actually visited a camp, then he would have met him."

That\u2019s when we actually tried to have a real conversation.\n \nIt quickly became apparent that not only did we had very little in common, she didn\u2019t know much about the world we live in either - outside of the confines of our small city, and outside of the interests of her circle of teenage friends. Trying to find something that we could talk about was painful!\n \nEventually, I did mention where I worked, and it turned out that her father worked for the same company. He had worked there all her life. Finally, there was an opening to ask a follow-up question! It was a big computer company, and I didn\u2019t recognize her father\u2019s name, so I asked what kind of work he did. She had no idea! I tried to lead her through it: engineering, sales, finance, HR, legal, manufacturing, hardware, software\u2026 Nothing rang a bell! She did know that the company made computers, but that was the extent of it. She had never seen her father\u2019s office, never absorbed or asked any questions about what he did. It boggled my mind that someone could live to 19 or 20 years old without having even the slightest clue about what their parent did for work."

Actually, I used him on about 80% of my shows. He is British, from just outside of London. I never checked his visa status. Since I hired him through a lighting company, I figured he was either a citizen or had the appropriate visa. I try to stay away from political discussions with those I hire for a production. However, these last 18 months have made that tough.\nI would listen to him explain how then candidate Trump was \u201cright on\u201d about immigration. He particularly believed so about Muslims and those from South of this country. I listened as he said that he was sure most Puerto Ricans were here illegally. I explained that Puerto Rico was a US commonwealth. He stated that commonwealths were just a \u201csystem for poor and lazy\u201d people to take advantage of the real citizens and hard workers. Now, that seemed a bit odd coming from someone living in Chicago, but from the UK. I let it go.\nThis went on a bit. Then, after way too many drinks in celebration of one he'll of a show, he let it slip that his visa had expired 9 years ago. However, since he was white the US would never deport him. This is a man here illegally, earning about $175,000/year. His goal he stated, was to marry his girlfriend and then he was sure to never be deported. He kept his bashing of what he called \u201cillegals\u201d for months.\nI finally stopped hiring him. I also called the INS 5 times. I was told by the INS official that there are over 300,000 English, Irish, and French here illegally, all earning a median income of $64,000. He also said that going after these people was a sure way to stop any promotions in your future.\nSo, really, the dumbest or most hypocritical person was an American in name only. He hated other people here illegally. Just as bad was a part of our government who was affair to go after these people due to political repercussions.\nHonestly, it was sad all the way around."

But like many people in this country he did not care to apply his brain and did not let my friend inside. Long story short, my friend moved onto a restaurant nearby!\n \nSecond: This is not with one person but with several Americans. I am Indian and of course I have Indian accent. What surprises me is Americans accept every accent from the world except Indian but I digress. I pronounce the word Mosquito as \u201cmuskito\u201d and apparently American pronunciation is \u201cmuskeeeto\u201d and it literally took me over 20 minutes to explain someone that mosquitoes breed in stagnant water!

Most Australian's don't know or care about the history of our origins, at least in the patriotic way done in the USA. I think we have a pretty good idea of where all the Aussies live, and I'd like it if we were a little more knowledgeable and proud of our origins and development path.\n \nWhen I scratched the surface of understanding of about World politics, history, geography, current events etc, in the U.S. I was appalled. Professionals who didn't know a European country, any capitals, when WWII actually started, who the leader of any other countries were etc. I realized when in the U.S. on business that the news is totally about U.S. affairs, while in Australia it is 30/30 local and foreign with 40% for sport.\nThe Americans who I found more realistic and interesting were those who had travelled and could compare other countries with the USA.\n \nWhile it's true that we're all ignorant about lots of things, the truly inept revel in their ignorance. The Dunning Kruger effect is a human cognitive bias that says that ignorant people are ignorant of their ignorance and so trust in their own opinion more than someone of knowledge does. They are often more believed in committees too - because they are sure of their (ill informed) opinions, whereas an expert will know the limit of certainty of their answers. I believe the democratisation of publishing through the internet and the D-K effect are responsible for the rise of \"the endarkenment\", where ignorance is celebrated, and all opinions are thought equally true."

Here comes the most profound ignorance I have ever experienced in America: what she told me was that god and jesus never intended for the races to mix because blacks and whites go to separate heavens when they die.

It was waking him up, he said, and besides he thought it was \u201cunprofessional\u201d for me to hit send while he was sleeping. I should wait until his normal business hours to do so.\n \nNote that at no point had I complained about him not responding to my messages late at night. In fact, I\u2019d gone out of my way to establish with him that 48\u201372 hours was perfectly acceptable response time, otherwise I would call or text him if it was urgent. By definition, anything I emailed him was important and totally non-urgent\n \nHe literally thought that I should keep track of the hours that he and the other team members kept and only \nwrite \nemails during that time. He was quite adamant that it was, and I repeat this nincompoop\u2019s words, \u201cunprofessional\u201d for me to do otherwise.\n \nI was, in fact, dumbfounded and could not think of what to respond. In that moment, I could not think of anything in recent memory I\u2019d personally heard with my own ears that was quite so ignorant.\n \nThe medium was designed, after all, so that person A could write and send it any old time that was convenient to them and person B could read and respond in turn when it suited them, in this way being just like paper mail, only faster. The recipient can set up whatever device (pc, tablet, phone) they receive email on anyway they like to suit their own preferences (which the sender could not possibly know). In other words, he could just silence notifications when he went to sleep (although for what I was paying him, he could easily have set up a temporary web-based mail account \u2014 for free \u2014 specifically for this project and only even logged in to it every few days).\n \nIronically, for 10\u201312 years of my career in high tech (in San Francisco/Silicon Valley) I specialized in email, in some cases rolling it out on a global scale for large companies. \u201cUnprofessional\u201d, therefore was not merely a ridiculous accusation in this context, but literally untrue.\n \nOnly later did it occur to me that I should have told him the only time I could sign his check would be late at night but, as a professional courtesy, would decline to do so.\n \nIf I\u2019m wrong, by the way, someone please tell me in the comments. I\u2019d hate to, like, write birthday and holiday cards or something when the people I\u2019d send them to were taking a nap!\n \nI know there are much more important issues to be ignorant on, but this one still stands out in my mind."

The Pastor certainly didn\u2019t object, nor did their Choir Director.\n \nOnly one person ever complained, an old woman at the Methodist Church who told me that it was a sin for me to worship Friday nights at the Jewish Temple.

A fellow student of mine (a white male) asks me for my twitter username.\n \nAt first, I decline. But someone else gave me away. So he finds my account and starts scrolling.\n \nDuring the night of the election, and the night after, I had tweeted a few things about the outcome. I side with Hillary, and I was just a little upset at the results. In one tweet, there was mention of white supremacy and male dominance in society.\n \nI guess that didn't sit right with him, so he turns to me and asks why I tweeted it. I said,\n \n\u201cthat's just how I feel\u201d.\n \nHe starts arguing with me about politics (which shouldn't really happen in a high-school setting), and telling me about how white supremacy isn't a real thing. I just ignore him.\n \nThen he turns to his friend and says:\n \n\u201cyou know what I do to these kinda people? I block them.\u201d\n \nSo he blocks me in front of my face to make me feel bad. This didn't really affect me at all in any way, and I never wanted his attention in any way, but it was their attitudes that really irked me. I know that they have all the right to block me, but way they did so really threw me off.\n \nThis was by no means the rudest encounter, but it showed me a general trend in American people. It is that people like to give eachother a hard time when it comes to opinions. Many people find it hard to ignore when someone has a different view than them."

I was travelling on my own but that was no problem on these trains, I had a roomette which entitled me to eat in the dining car and chat to people. The way the dining car works is that you get seated in the next open seat at a table of 4 as you turn up, so it generally works out that you're seated with different people for each meal. As these were the last few weeks before the election, a lot of the talk was about just that. I had my opinions on the candidates of course and with me being European, I would be naturally more aligned with Obama and Democrats. However I was very mindful that this was not my country and not my place to start heated discussions so I was careful to keep a neutral tone in my conversations. The demographics in the dining car of a long distance Amtrak train are quite old. There are lots of retired people who now have the chance to see America at last and they head out on a great Amtrak adventure.\n \nSo I was on the California Zephyr heading towards Denver from San Francisco and I went along for my evening meal. I'd had breakfast earlier in the day with a very ancient man who was convinced that Obama was a \u2018'damn moslem\u2019 and I was a bit nervous that I'd get him again. Instead I ended up sat opposite a couple in their mid 60s or so and eventually the conversation turned to politics. This is now well over 8 years ago for me so I can't remember how the conversation led to this point but it got on to the topic of GW Bush and how the husband thought that Bush had been a fantastic president so with me in my best neutral tone, the conversation went something like this\n \nMe: So you think that Bush handled 9/11 and the aftermath well? That John Kerry may not have handled it differently or better?\n \nHusband: Well we haven't had any terrorists attacks since then have we! So it obviously went really well!\n \nMe: But other places have had attacks, Bali have, hundreds were killed in the Madrid attack, my own town of London was attacked and some of my friends were very close to being caught in it\n \nHusband: Yeah but WE weren't attacked! *defiant look, straight in my eyes*\n \nWife: *squeezes husbands arm in a \u2018 you should shut up now honey\u2019 kind of way and has a panicked look on her face*\n \nMe: *silence*\n \nAnd a very awkward rest of the meal after that\n \nSo maybe not the most ignorant in terms of not knowing how many states there are, but thinking it's ok for other countries to take the hit resulting from your foreign policy so you don't have to and having the gall to say that to someone from one of the cities that took the hit is massively ignorant and offensive"

In our eighth grade year, he transferred to another school. Frankly, he was the most spoiled little brat I have ever had the displeasure to meet at that point. Everyone in our grade breathed a sigh of relief at the prospect of not having to deal with him anymore. I\u2019m not going to go into detail about what he did in class, but let\u2019s just say my Mythology teacher let loose a scream of frustration because of him and caused all the teachers in the hall to check up on her on one instance.\n \nLet\u2019s call him Thomas.\n \nAnyways, in my freshman year of high school, we ended up going to the same school, but fortunately, I only had one class with him, and that was French. Now, I take my language classes very seriously. \nVery \nseriously. And so with Thomas disrupting the class with inane comments about \neverything\n, (and some of them being extremely sexist and flippant about genders and whatnot) I was ready to pull my hair out. I\u2019m pretty sure the entire class was too, along with our poor teacher. But that\u2019s not the point of this.\n \nOne day, the teacher pulled up Google maps to show us where the small country of Andorra is. As she was dragging the map to it, Thomas let out a dramatic gasp.\n \nBy then, the class as a whole had already silently decided that we would all ignore him and his unwanted commentary.\n \nHowever, what came out of Thomas\u2019 mouth just made all of us simultaneously turn our heads to him to stare in disbelief.\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s where Italy is? I thought it was in China!\u201d\n \nThe entire class just stared at him with mouths gaping open like fish. Meanwhile, he was sitting in his desk looking genuinely confused about that. After a few seconds of silence and the realization that he actually didn\u2019t know that Italy was indeed, \nnot\n in China, the teacher cautiously pointed to the smart board/Promethean thingy and said,\n \n\u201cWell, there\u2019s Italy. And here\u2019s Andorra. And make a side note that China does not contain Italy, because otherwise, the Roman Empire would have also been in China, and that just doesn\u2019t make any damn sense.\u201d\n \nSeeing as this was Thomas though, he still insisted that Italy was in China. I suppose by that point in the year, the teacher was absolutely done with him, and so invited him up to the board and told him to find Italy in China.\n \nI found this deeply amusing and had the hardest time keeping my mouth shut. I saw others struggling to keep their laughter in as well, which really wasn\u2019t a surprise, considering we were all about to see Thomas futilely try and find Italy in China on a map.\n \nNone of us ever let him live that down."

Judging somebody based on the color of their skin is despicable regardless of who the victim is.\n \nThis guy's worldview was that he was not allowed to succeed because he was black. In America this attitude is completely ignorant because if anybody in the United States truly wants to succeed all they have to do is try.

An adult student sitting next to me in my community college accounting class today did not know. I was and still am a bit shocked. Any interest ever in business or economics or politics or rich people worship would lead to at least knowing who he is. The guy is referenced frequently in the media and by policy makers and is on TV giving interviews and graduation ceremonies speeches. I even saw a joint interview with him and Jay-Z one time. He is not one of those behind the scenes secretive types.\n \nORIGINAL: Everyone has different levels of common knowledge and field specific knowledge. I think my shock factor goes up or down depending on what a certain person does not know that I think they SHOULD know given their age, background, and access to knowledge via their language and modern telecommunication connectivity. Example: I do not expect my 7 year old niece to know basic ingredients for cookies, nor do I expect my 90 year old grandfather to know the different browsers on a computer, nor do I expect some random poor guy in the Central African Republic to name more than one U.S. president or any car company.\n \nLast week, I talked to a 60-70 year old white middle class English speaking American from a red state. She stated that she recently learned from a new friend that \u201cthere are two kinds of Muslims! I did not know that!\u201d I mentally face palmed but said nothing. Never mind that there a 4 main branches of Sunni Islam, and various versions of Shia (12\u2032ers and 8\u2032ers), and also got Sufis, and offshoots of Shia such a Alawites, and other groups such as Kurds or Central Asians who might mix in certain customs into one of the Sunni branches. I wouldn\u2019t expect any American to be aware of these nuances unless they were from the Middle East pr studying religion or something. I know I don\u2019t have a handle on all of the variants either.\n \nWhat blew me away is the knowledge I expected her to have, considering her age and education and nationality. If you were of college age or above at the time of the USA invasion of Iraq in 2003 and present in the USA or near any English media, how could you NOT be aware of the Sunni vs Shia based breakup during the multi-year USA occupation?! Every day on TV and in the news paper, those two words were mentioned and referred to in any explanation about the ongoing armed conflict, civil war, and reconstruction effort. Every day for multiple years. Any half discussion on Iraq always includes those two words. Were my expectations too high for this woman to know that there were at least \u201c2 kinds of Muslims\u201d? That was an ignorant moment recently.\n \nP.S. on second thought, that lady might have been living overseas for a part of the 2000s and she is not the world affairs type and really doesn\u2019t like any details of any conflict (domestic or intl).

Oh it's the wall I see on instagram.\n \nHe meant the East Side Gallery which is a huge landmark in Berlin and honestly, anyone who has remotely read about the WW2 (which i assume was thought in school, would have known about the Berlin wall and the many historical backstories it comes with)\n \n(After i've said i'm from Singapore)\n \n(3) Wait so is that part of China?\n \nNo. In fact, Singapore is 6 hours away from Beijing, which is not exactly near. But I wouldn't fault him for this. Singapore has many Chinese and is tiny so it's easy to misunderstand.\n \n(4) So you are Chinese?\n \nYes I am ethically Chinese. I look 100% Chinese so I don't really understand the point of this question. It is like asking a very obvious white, Are you white?\n \nat this point i realise their mind is a bit blown, how can a chinese that speaks chinese not be from China?\n \n(5) How could you speak English so well?\n \nEnglish is the first and official language of all Singaporeans. English was the first language I was taught, english is the language i work and study in. And this seems to confused them.\n \n(6) What English is your first language? That can't be it, what \u201casian language\u201d do you speak?\n \nat this point i'm already a bit pissed. What do you meant by \u201casian language\u201d? I already told you i speak english (in fact we converse in english) and that they heard me speak a bit of chinese. They could have just asked \u201cso do you speak any other languages?\u201d in which i would have politely replied no, i only speak english and chinese, instead of asking me what other \u201casian\u201d language do i speak? lol and he had that condenscening tone which makes it worst.\n \nTo be fair, Singapore is a fairly small country and I wouldn't expect everybody to know much about our country but even my French roommate chip in and agreed that she too had met many ignorant americans. In fact, she said an american she knew thought that Paris and France were two different countries!\n \np.s. not throwing shade, probably sure there are ignorant people all around the world in different countries just sharing my experiences."

If they can\u2019t articulate the argument realistically and sincerely, it shows that person has never opened their mind enough to consider why others hold an opposing view - that is the hallmark of ignorance.\n \nCase in point. The majority of Trump supporters were labeled as \u201cracist, mysogynist, homophobes\u201d. Why else would they support Trump as a candidate?\n \nRacist - Many on the left would posit that Trump supporters want a wall, or tighter border security because \u201cwe hate Mexicans or other foriegners\u201d. Not true.\n \n1. The majority of those on the right advocating tighter border security are considering the impact of more people requiring more services when we have finite resources to address these problems at current population levels already.\n \n2. Many on the Right have watched the impact of unrestricted migration into European countries and believe that careful screening of those seeking entry is simply prudent.\n \nCaution and prudence are not racist. Let\u2019s face it, you would not let your daughter spend the night at a stranger\u2019s home until you\u2019ve at least had the chance to speak with the parent. Is that because you are hateful, or is that because you are prudent?\n \nMisogynism - Did Trump say horrible things about women? Certainly. Did Hillary defend a child rapist? Certainly. However, based on what we believe to be the best person to address economic issues, issues of national security, job growth, etc - the candidates on the Right were more closely aligned with our views on how to succeed. The vote was not an Anti-Woman referendum.\n \nHomophobists - Not seeing a issues like whom one can marry, or what is the appropriate titling of bathrooms, or who must bake a cake for whom, as being a top-priority national concern for America when we are facing stagnate job growth, continued terrorist threats, nuclear capable countries who maintain an Anti-US position does not make us homophobic. It simply says, be reasonable - at the end of the day how important is to a person in Vermont which bathroom I choose to use in Colorado? At the end of the day, how much time do I spend in public bathrooms anyway - so let\u2019s use our time wisely to address bigger issues.\n \nIn summary - Ignorance is not taking time to see WHY others maintain positions they do. It is typically not out of hate or spite, but rather differing world views. At the end of the day most people on both sides of the aisle want similar things:\nAn ability to provide for ourselves and our families.\nRelative safety in our neighborhoods\nAccess to food and healthcare.\nWe simply disagree on the best avenues to enact the greatest good for the greatest number of people. To not understand that and simply say views differ based on Love vs. Hate is completely ignorant."

In any other situation i wouldn't have most likely given 0 the time of day, It wasent a good time ever being around 0, to be truthful it was just a bringdown and a drag really..0 was one of them that seen kindness as weakness. 0 openly making statements or saying things i knew we're straight up scandalous ..For instance saying quote;\u201d Fuck yea i jacked that bitch, that's what the stupid bitch gets for not locking her door.\u201d Well i was also one of those stupid ones 0 enjoyed, My\u201d Wake up call.\u201d I knew something was off with 0, always loud and intrusive, not to mention the obvious patterns \u201d kids taken away, would get back,only to have them removed again, moving in with ,or out of , every few months, always something negative going on ,no thought of imposing on others\u2026Draining crap\u2026And its really not what 0 did that bothers me the most, i couldn't care less at this point, its the whole picture, the concept of how rude and lowdown can you go? At any time a normal decent human would of mentioned the problem, especially to someone who only did right by them, it was in no way called for or neccasary, i was not deserving of that treatment, Im honestly blown away by how low down and dirty 0 is.. The deceitfulness and betrayal\u2026The lack of respect given to me, that i freely gave \u2026Defending 0 when accused of stealing\u2026.I dont understand that type of behavior? I will not ever ignore the obvious again.. My ignorance is believing the best even in the worst..Feeling very stupid.. So I, Me, Myself, is most ignorant i know\u2026"

That made me sick to my stomach and I almost gave in to a primal urge to beat the living s*** out of the person. I don't know why someone would just assume this true I am of German heritage but if I wanted to be I could be in the Sons of the American Revolution (SAR) since my ancestors date back to some of the states founders. Also just because I have a German last name (which is actually technically Prussian) that doesn't mean that I'm just German I'm actually English, Scottish, Irish, Dutch, German, Prussian and two different tribes of Native American. They just assume that I'm 100% German. Even if I was a hundred percent German it wouldn't matter that doesn't mean that I am that kind of person. Yes Germany has gotten the black guy over the past 100 years but they have hundreds and hundreds of years of peace and great work ethic and economy that didn't involve genocide of anyone although it's obviously not consecutive."

We were all proud at first, thinking we had been selected\u2026 but then someone found out that any marching band can have the privilege provided they apply for the opportunity.\n \nThe trip was a disaster. We, a marching band set up for November football games in New England fall/winter means that our only uniform was a warm wool one. Yeah. We marched in that, in Disney, in April. Two kids passed out from heat stroke, and one from heat exhaustion. Two out of three, although I don\u2019t know how many had heat cramps. So\u2026 definitely some ignorance there in regards to the \u201cright uniform for the gig\u201d.\n \nBut no\u2026 this was at some point when we were on our own, and a few of us went into get ice cream on Main Street. My friend Matt\u2026 played trumpet\u2026 Matt M. Matthews. Yes, his name is\u2026 Matthew M. Matthews. I don\u2019t know if he was joking when he told me his middle name was also Matthew, but he did laugh at the time. Anyway, Matt was in front of me, and he asked for two scoops of coffee ice cream on a waffle cone.\n \nSee, we lived in New England where in grade school in the 70\u2019s, we had three choices of milk in the cafeteria; Plain, Chocolate, or Coffee. At home, there was Elipse syrup right next to the Hershey\u2019s or Quik or Ovaltine. Eclipse was coffee syrup you could pour into milk and make coffee milk, like you add chocolate mix to milk and make chocolate milk. We were also raised with Coffee Ice Cream being a flavor just like any other flavor.\n \nOk. So this was Rhode Island. C\u2019mon\u2026 we couldn\u2019t have been THAT far ahead of the rest of the world, could we?\n \nBut as it turned out, in the mid 80\u2019s in Florida\u2026 they had never heard of Coffee Ice Cream.\n \nThe girl at the counter asks my friend Matt.. \u201cWould you like cream and sugar with that?\u201d\n \nMatt was like \u201cOn the scoops? If you only have soft serve that\u2019s fine.\u201d\n \nShe was clearly confused \u201cNo, I mean in your coffee. Do you want cream and sugar in your coffee?\u201d\n \nMatt picked up on it before I did \u201cYou never heard of coffee ice cream?\u201d\n \nShe was visibly astonished with the idea \u201cThat sounds delicious! No, we don\u2019t have no coffee ice cream here.\u201d\n \nI was just a little astonished myself to be on Main Street USA in Disney World in the 80\u2019s\u2026 to find out they had never heard of coffee ice cream (or coffee milk as we were to also find out). Main Street USA was ignorant of coffee flavoring for ice cream and milk."

(BTW, never judge a whole country by the representation of a couple of teenagers. Teenagers tend to be pretty dumb. They\u2019re still working it out.)\n \nAmericans are at a unique disadvantage in this regard because the whole world is obsessed with our film, music, politics, culture, etc. So everybody knows what\u2019s going on in our country. This creates a false sense of awareness around the world, and ignorance in America. The truth is, an Italian might know all the current events in American politics, but they probably have no idea what\u2019s going on in Senegal, West Africa. Someone in Columbia might have seen the newest film release from Hollywood, but they don\u2019t have a clue who the most popular pop star is in South Korea, etc. etc. etc. And for that matter, I\u2019ve been met with blank stares from people from Switzerland, the UK, Austria, Australia, etc. when I say I\u2019m from Pennsylvania. They don\u2019t know where Pennsylvania is (just south of New York\u2014they know that one); they just know where America is.\n \nKnowing where America is without knowing where the individual states are is, geographically speaking, not that different from knowing where Europe is, but not knowing the exact borders of each country. There are a lot of cultures, land, and people in between New York and California. This is also why Europeans tend to enjoy international travel much more (and more cheaply) than Americans. Me traveling to San Francisco, my own country, would be like a German traveling well into Russia. And I\u2019ve heard more than once a European or Asian saying they want to travel to all the major landmarks in the U.S. in a week or two. I just smile and nod.\n \nDespite all this, everybody likes to gather together and laugh about how ignorant Americans are. Well, it\u2019s not that simple, and they\u2019re often betraying their own prejudices. All that to say, I don\u2019t expect non-Americans to memorize our state map (that\u2019s not your responsibility) or understand our cultures when all you see are sensationalized headlines in the news and Hollywood blockbusters (and no, I don\u2019t know Kobe Bryant; he\u2019s not my neighbor; yes, I\u2019ve been asked this). But I would love for everybody to judge a bit less. The one thing I\u2019ve learned from traveling the world is that we\u2019re all unbelievably shaped by our immediate surroundings, and none of us has as much justification to judge as we might think."

Then this one kid says \u201cwe\u2019re doing the holocaust.\u201d Now I don't know how he came up with this being a stand, but he did. I tried explaining that that wasn't a stand and rather it was just genocide. Then he said \u201c\"We\u2019re doing it because of its impact on the history.\u201d Okay first off \u201c\"the history\u201d. It's not \u201c\"the history\u201d its \u201chistory\u201d. If he said \u201c\"the history of ww2\u201d, I would've been fine, but he didn't. second, ITS IMPACT ON HISTORY ISNT THE THEME, ITS TAKING A STAND."

So in answer to her question, I told her it was an American nickel. She repeated that she wasn't going to accept it and I asked her .. \"It says \"United States of America. This IS the United States of America, isn't it?\"\n \nHowever, for several reasons, I gave up:\n \n- she was an idiot, and usually, there is little to be gained by arguing with idiots,\n \n- it was only a nickel and I was able to replace it with another nickel - not worth making a scene over it,\n \n- finally and most importantly, it turned out she was also our guide in that very dark cave and perhaps, even if she was an idiot, it wouldn't have been a good idea to unnecessarily antagonize her.\n \nEdited; comment added, a week later: I also met another ignoramus.\n \nI had an email friend, who I shall call \"Granny\" from the deep south of the US. I knew she was something of a cranky, ignorant redneck and my children asked me why I would bother to correspond with her? Because she is like a LOT of people out there, and I wanted to try to see and understand the world through lenses which were different than those I usually use (my own).\n \nOh, she was interesting, all right .. if ever some subject came up about politicians, she'd go on a several page rant about them, calling them every name in the book. I'm not sure she knew the meaning of the term \"moderation\"; at least, she almost never used it. And ignorant? When my Mom was in her mid-80's, she had a series of small strokes and Granny implied it was my fault for not feeding her all sorts of energy foods that you usually see in those scam ads. As it was, my Mom lived to 89; the average lifespan for women in the US is 82.1, so she certainly wasn't taken from us prematurely.\n \nThis went on for some years .. sometimes I'd tiptoe around her, sometimes, I'd invite a response and would never be disappointed. This carried on until she sent a note and copied several people, whereupon I and one other man on that list had the gall, the temerity, to respond with some of our own comments to the group she identified. Here is the first line of her reply: \"\nI do not remembe giving either one of you male atheist permission to rape the addresses of my livery\n\" [sic]. Then she went on to say how she wished she could castrate me, plus a series of other equally vicious comments. And how is it that I still have that quote? Because her response was so incredible, I copied her letter into my diary file, before I deleted all her email and her address. I haven\u2019t heard from her since (18 months and counting), don\u2019t expect to, but wouldn\u2019t respond to her anyway.\n \nGranny was a cranky, unhappy old woman who have obviously burned enough people in her life that she complained about not having many friends. It was my understanding that she was estranged even from her daughter; gee, I wonder why?"

These \u201cfact checkers and control organs\u201d do not exist anymore or if they do, they are holed out utterly to the point of being obsolete. You have to ask yourself: Why is CNN telling something like this or that? What do they have to gain by saying this? What political spectrum do they have (donated to hillaries campaign) and is it visible in their reporting ( this is an ear deafening yes, like most mainstream media outlets).\n \nNow armed with these answers ask yourself the following: What does protesting mean for me? Do I benefit from it in any way? If i do protest and it turns violent what will i do? IF i get caught rioting or beating someone up who profits from it? ( the last question is always the media that WANTS riots, it is their bread and butter. IF you riot and \u201ckicking buttskies, the media\u2019s ratings goes up which means more income in advertisements/stock prices will go up etc)\n \nSo who benefits from rioting? The media and they use you, the people to do it and they do not pay you a dime ( even if they did i don\u2019t think a lot of sane people will accept the money or even riot at all). Thus those average joes and janes are reduced to 21st century slaves that listen to the elite mainstream media overlords clacking of the whip.\n \nOf course this isn\u2019t exclusive to the US but the last months it seems that the US is so susceptible to this behavior. Arm yourselves against it by thinking for yourselves, be skeptical about what news says ( be it left, right,etc do your own research if you want to find out the truth). If someone tells you \u201cthis is the truth and if you think otherwise you are *insert a curse word or whatever\u201d you know you are dealing with propaganda especially when they do not state facts to back up their claims.\n \nThanks for bearing with me on this rather lengthy piece :)"

Why couldn\u2019t they just shoot them in the leg?\n \nMe: Because leg wounds are harder to achieve and are often fatal anyways, so if your goal is to put down the threat right now it\u2019s a bad idea, and if your goal is to not kill them, it\u2019s also a bad idea?\n \nThem: Well cops shouldn\u2019t be shooting anyone!\nThem: Why don\u2019t Chinese people want freedom/rebel against the communist dictatorship?\n \nMe: Because their lives are already really good and steadily improving?\n \nThem: But they don\u2019t have free speech and civil rights and stuff!\n \nMe: But they have houses to live in and food to eat and do you know what Maslow\u2019s hiearchy of needs is?\n \nThem: But muh Tiananmen!\n \nMe: \u2026fuck it, I\u2019m done\n(One day, this will be my face as I unleash the logic bomb that is \u201cyou only hear about aborted female babies due to the One Child Policy, but have you considered that the female babies who survive get the undivided resources of the entire family instead of having to compete with/sacrifice her future for her male siblings, resulting in an entire generation of working urban professional women who are better able to carry on the fight for women\u2019s rights in China\u201d, and it shall be the first note of the eldritch song that ends their sanity.)"

My answer was never funny to them, which resulted in me realizing they weren\u2019t joking. I\u2019m aware they were just kids, maybe ten or eleven years old, but ever since that happened, I began to think of Americans as very intelligent and civilized, but quite ignorant when it came to information regarding other countries, or sometimes even their own. For example, I once took a Business Cultures class in Berlin where all the students were Americans, except for me, and none of them knew what the highest mountain in the United States\u2019 was, except for me, a Mexican. I acknowledge this reply could be interpreted as a generalization, which I think it is, because most of the smartest, decent and dedicated people I know are from the U.S., but I do think ignorance is one of the main reasons why a clown is currently working in the Oval Office. Also, we\u2019re not much better off. A clown governs Mexico too, and ignorance is a main cause as well."

You are white!\n \nThen the foreign student would politely explain that she was a descendant of European immigrants, like the vast majority of the people in her country.\n \nIA: You have an accent, where are you from?\n \nFS: I am from Uruguay.\n \nIA: And what language do you speak in your country?\n \nFS: We speak Spanish.\n \nIA: If you speak Spanish you have to be a Mexican!\n \nThen the foreign student would politely explain that Spanish is spoken in many different countries.\n \nIA: What is your name?\n \nFS: My name is Eva.\n \nIA: And where are you from?\n \nFS: I am from Uruguay.\n \nIA: If your name is Eva you have to be Polish, because my best friend\u2019s name is Eva and she is Polish.\n \nThen the foreign student would politely explain that Eva is a common name in many European languages.\n \nIA: You have an accent, where are you from?\n \nFS: I am from Uruguay.\n \nIA: I think you have to be from Finland, because my sister-in-law is from Finland and you sound just like her.\n \nThen the foreign student smiled politely but did not answer (or maybe I just don\u2019t remember what she answered).\n \nOn one occasion, while on a trip to California, we were shopping in a small retail store. The saleswoman addressed her in German, to which she replied that she didn\u2019t understand. The saleswoman then asked her where she was from. After hearing the answer \u201cUruguay,\u201d the saleswoman said, \u201cBut you look German, and you speak with a German accent, you have to be German!\u201d (She was not German, her parents were not German, they did not speak German, and they did not have any German ancestry.)\n \nShe told me of several other encounters with IAs, which I did not witness.\n \nShe heard several variations of the comments:\n \n\u201cIf your name is Eva you have to be German,\u201d\n \n\u201cYour name is Eva, you have to be from Sweden.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow come you are white?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou don\u2019t look Spanish.\u201d\n \nShe lamented to me that many times when she answered the question, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d her skin darkened and her IQ lowered in the eyes of the American questioner.\n \nIn one case, on hearing her accent, a woman told her, \u201cYou have dark skin, are you from Egypt?\u201d\n \nShe also heard, \u201cYou look Indian, are you from India?\u201d \u201cYou have a Russian accent.\u201d \u201cYou have an Italian accent.\u201d \u201cAre you Arabic? You look Arabic to me.\u201d \u201cYou have an accent, are you from Turkey?\u201d \u201cI recognize your accent, you must be from Albania.\u201d\n \nOn one occasion, when asked for the millionth time the \u201cwhere are you from?\u201d question, she answered, \u201cI am from Betazed.\u201d \u201cAnd where is that?\u201d the questioner then asked, to which she replied, \u201cIn Europe, of course!\u201d And the questioner seemed satisfied.\n \nAs Dave Barry would say, I am not making this up."

And then that the border skirmishes with Switzerland seemed to have broken out again, as happened every now and then.

A lot sound quite Canadian.\n \nNow to the actual story about the ignorant American ;)\n \nI\u2019m from New Hampshire which is a tiny state in New England. In other words irrelevant. The southern US is very backwards with many conservative zealots who can be quite stupid sounding almost like Donald Trump. The public school system down south is actually a joke, and it makes the whole US look bad. The school systems in New Hampshire are ranked as similar to the ones in Finland which have some of the best school systems in the world.

Aren\u2019t you from England?\u201d\n \nAt that moment I was half laughing in the inside, but also feeling kinda bad for the lady, because although she was nice, she was incredibly stupid when it came to geography. As it turned out she had never even left Mississippi, and her whole family lived in the same county, so she never really left. Her \u201ccomfort zone\u201d, or \u201cradius of knowledge\u201d. To her anything outside of Oktibbeha County, Mississippi is totally foreign. In fact she told me the biggest journey she ever took was to see an old friend in Jackson, Mississippi which is only 201km away(125 mi).

As if white for wedding was as obvious as the nose on my face.\n \nI didn't know where to start. The truth is, aside from red being the colour of marriage , plain white is a colour of mourning in Indian culture (more so , Hindu culture) , so it is specifically prohibited during the weddings. Traditionally, the colour white had been associated with clothes that a widow wears.\n \nBut I obviously did not want to offend her by saying that.\n \nEdit (after story ) : On why I did not educate her about Hindu tradition-\n \nWedding is sacred in all cultures and so are the colors and traditions associated with them. I did not want to stain her lifelong belief by telling her that what's sacred for her is cursed for me. She does not need to know that, not from me atleast .\n \nBut yes, I did not leave her ignorant forever. I told her the importance of red colour in Indian weddings , without discrediting her faith. Few days later I brought my wedding pictures and shared it with her and my other colleagues."

We were discussing the US need for a vast increase in shipping production due to the fact all major enemies were an ocean away. A girl in class (she was about 17 at the time), raises her hand and asks , \u201cwait I'm confused, isn't Germany in the United States, why would we need to sail across the ocean to fight them?\u201d. I was a bit perplexed, so I ask her to go to the map on my wall and show me the area she believes Germany was located. She pointed to the American Midwest. It was at that moment I realized I had a far more difficult task ahead of me than teaching my students about a few important historical events.\n \n#2: This one didn't happen in my class, instead it has become lore amongst the teachers at my school. Here goes\u2026\n \nA girl approached a fellow teacher to talk about an issue that had been on her mind a great deal lately. She proceeded to explain that she was a bit late (she missed her period) and thought she might be pregnant. she was afraid of what her parents might say if she was. The teacher asked if he had taken a pregnancy test, to which the girl responded, \u201cyeah I took one over the weekend, I was so nervous that I had a friend take the test for me.\u201d The teacher was incredulous, and responded by gently explaining that pregnancy tests didn't work like that. The girl countered by explaining that it was fine because even though her friend peed on the test, she was still in the room and the test would still be able to sense her pregnancy. The teacher simply directed her to the nurse after that."

Second amendments does give the right to bear arms, it is the most important amendment. And no, Hitler did not give his civilians guns, his most famous speech says that disarming citizens is the best way to control them! we countered her by using hard evident facts that of the Hitler quote and showed her the Second Amendment using a book of the US Constitution, and yet she refuses the fact and uses her gut as historic evidence.\n \nWe usually relate ignorance with the christian right in the US but even those even in the other side can have their times."

Once I was telling an American that it takes me an hour by bus to go to school and she replied:\u201d didn\u2019t you tell me that Malta is small?\u201d Sure but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t take time to go to further places.\n \nAnother time an American commented on one of my profiles telling me that she heard from a Maltese person that people here all know each other. Thing is, that is a saying we Maltese say, it should not be taken literarly. It is just an expression.\n \nAnother time I was having a rant about my country, and I received the comment:\u201d I don\u2019t know how you hate Malta, when I was there all I did was partying and go to the beach.\u201d sure because you visited as a tourist you don\u2019t have to live here and pay the bills.\n \nAnother time I was ranting about the cold, and an American asked me:\u201d isn\u2019t Malta an island?\u201d Hell yeah that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have seasons. It seems that if Americans know that you live on an island, they think you party all the time and are always in swimsuits; sipping pina colada with flowers in your hair. Yeah right\u2026\n \nAnother time I wrote a long comment on a post. I wrote that English is not my native language so my English might not be that clear and that I had grammar and spelling issues. Guess what happened? An American left me a rude comment about my grammar and spelling being terrible and called me stupid. *face palm*\n \nAnother time the opposite happened. An American called me fake because according to him my English was too good for a foreigner. Whaaat????\n \nA pet peeve of mine that I have about Americans is when online they write:\u201dthis country\u201d, while actually referring to the whole world. Please Americans the internet is used globaly by anyone not just Americans. I hate it when you talk about the world like it is only made up of America. Not part of the question but damn.\n \nThen I have these pet peeves which happen by people of all countries. It is not part of the question either but I hate it when it happens. 1. Yes we have our own language. It is Maltese and is an unique language spoken in the Maltese islands. It is not English, Italian, French or Spanish. (Ok English is now accepted as a main language too, but primarly for most of us it is Maltese. )2. Yes we are an archipelago of islands. Malta being the main one. 3. No don\u2019t use google translate to talk to me. That stuff isn\u2019t accurate. 4. Malta is in Europe and part if the European Union. No it\u2019s not in Africa. 5. We have our flag, our government, our independance. No we aren\u2019t part of the British colony anymore, like many Brits seem to think. 6. Italians please not everyone here knows Italian. 7. For the rest of the world, sorry not all of us speak English fluently, it is still considered a foreign language for most of us. 8. Don\u2019t treat me like stupid or ridicule me because I come from a place you didn\u2019t know its existance or trying to fool me because I am a foreigner."

Based on American tourists I\u2019ve met in Europe I was expecting them all to be unbearably annoying. Maybe the more ignorant Americans are more noticeable, especially abroad, they talk louder and argue more.\n \nIf you want a story about someone very stupid but not American (in case you\u2019ve read all this thread and now think Americans are the worst):\n \nA girl in my Biology class at school (when we were 17) exclaimed with surprise: \u201cWhat? Pigeons lay eggs?!\u201d The teacher said \u201cyes, of course. All birds lay eggs.\u201d And she said \u201cReally? Like ducks?\u201d \u201cyes, like ducks. You can buy duck eggs in the shops.\u201d\n \nThis girl, like me, was white, British, middle-class. My parents knew her parents, they were nice and had just as much money. She went to the same primary school (even the same pre-school) as me, so we\u2019ve have the same formal education since we were 4 years old. She has had every opportunity to learn but she went her whole life knowing that chickens lay eggs and she was never, ever bothered to ask about the reproductive arrangements of other birds, or absorb that information when it was given to her (as in must have been at some point, she was 17). Last I heard she went to university, but I don\u2019t know what she studied.\n \nWhen I was a child I had a brain like a sponge, I wish I could learn as easily as I did then. I was also very curious about everything and always asked \u201cwhy?\u201d I\u2019ve heard this said about children in general, that children are naturally inquisitive and love to learn, and most people I meet agree that this is the case, my own children certainly are. But it seems that some children really don\u2019t care what lays eggs, what language they speak in France, why is the sky blue, what does \u201ccoincidence\u201d mean, what are your kidneys for, why is your blood red, what are the Egyptians (these are the sorts of things my son asks me, and other parents say the same sort of things). Sadly it seems that some children simply don\u2019t care, so long as they know the names of the members of the latest pop-band they will be accepted by their peers, and they don\u2019t care about anything else in the world. Some people, it seems, never question anything, even as children, and its not just an American phenomenon."

I was a bit amazed that being from pakistan, we just go and get our checkup and at max we have to wait for a day. Seeing a 63 year old wait 3 weeks just to see a physician was startling. So i dropped my original argument and asked to leave the climate change issue aside and tell me what trump plans to do with the healthcare system.\n \nThe guy was clueless. he said trump has a plan and that involves \u201csomething related to..\u201d empowering the individual states to take care of the issue on their own. when inquired how will that solve the problem, he had no idea.\n \ni felt sorry for the man. He was passionate about the issues he knew nothing about and the things he really should have known about, he had no idea. It saddened me to see he had just unwittingly voted against his interest and he was darn proud of it. I figure he was just a representative of a population who have been conned. a stupid electorate in pakistan made sense to me. But to see it in america was heart wrenching and in a way, i began to understand how trump got to be the leader of the \u201cfree world\u201d."

Perhaps blame the fact that besides me being on medication that makes it nearly impossible for me to think but also that machines teach us not to think for ourselves. In pressing in buttons our thinking abilities are rendered inactive thus eventually become muted over time.\n \nTechnology is rendering us low skilled laborers out of the job market. Its scary and frightening for a whole bunch of people like me who do not have access to education or the ability to think on a level demanding a living wage. Us poor people bear the brunt of blame for our inability to rise out of insurmountable odds against us. We attend elementary schools where the Kindergarten children run around slurring hate speech at the others so the chance for us to learn our ABCs does not arrive. Yet our schools push us onto the first grade ill equipped to handle the challenges that face us there because we never got the ingredients of a calm classroom education.\n \nNot only that our parents are in marriages that make our home environment chaotic too. Our parents if both home at the same yell at each other and bicker about money and sex and bargain on how much our father will pay our mother to feed us kids so we can eat that week for how many times she will sleep with him for that money\u2026.A little too much information? Perhaps. Keep reading.\n \nThe challenges that face us poor people render us in these positions in life where we are utterly helpless dependent on others because we never learn the tools on how to escape these situations. We get told to have them. But no one ever teaches how to get out of these bad situations even when we do earn the ability for education because others heap other insurmountable odds onto our plates like illness and physical disability rendering us then unable to attend universities like our peers sail through leading them to jobs that you reading this I imagine perhaps have.\n \nIts easy not to see poor people. We are everywhere. We are the checkers at 7-Eleven whose parents did not speak English so we went into Kindergarten not equipped with the language skills our English speaking peers have. It is little wonder when we get passed on through education that our deficiencies don\u2019t measure up to other peers. It is not a fair game we play in life and so when I hear others tell each other how ignorant we can be, I get saddened at the lack of insight that person gives to the checker like me who can\u2019t do simple math. I\u2019ve been a checker. I am a college graduate. I have been a checker after my college graduation. I have been many more things and many less things in my life but ignorant I don\u2019t think is one I am most proud of. So next time we all see a person who can\u2019t do simple math try to think about what that kid\u2019s childhood has been like leading to him or her not being able to count back from $100. It should not insight a superior mentality. It should insight gratitude for the privilege some of us get to attend elementary schools where the kids don\u2019t fight forcing a teacher into behavior management rather than educational inspirer extraordinaire. Be more grateful please and reach out in kindness with an open hand not a closed fist in mindset."

I was doing my usual effort, standing around and looking pretty near the Coopers' store at Pennsic, as is my wont, being the sort of garb-horse with a penchant or propensity or something like that for off-showing. Out of the South appears this pretty young thing.\n \n\"I hear you're from Canada,\" she said, nudging me with her elbow and winking one eye. \"And I hear you gots a lot of snow up there, eh?\" she continued with a slight but noticeable Southern drawl or accent, an accent I would later find out was from South Carolina. But that's not important...yet.\n \nUpon hearing this, my heart soared. Saying to myself, \"Thank you God, I really need this,\" I smiled at her and said, \"Why, yes. You know it ends at the border, don't you?\"\n \nWith a whimsically astonished gasp, she said, \"Really?\"\n \n\"Oh, yes,\" I assured her. \"A long time ago, on the hottest day of the year, they walked the entire border and said where there was snow, that would be Canada. And where there was no snow, that would be the United States.\"\n \nPuzzled and bemused, she wrinkled her brow and said, \"Really?\" to which I replied, \"Yes!\"\n \nSensing an opportunity for more fun, I added that we all ride around on dogsled teams, for there is too much snow for wheels to work effectively. In the animated silence, I also added, \"Why, just to get here (Pennsic) I had to drive my dogsled team for two days, just to get to the border, and move everything from my dogsled to my car which I keep in storage at the border leaving my dogsled team with a friend there, and then driving on for two hours to get to Pennsic.\"\n \nWide eyed and thoroughly impressed, she exclaimed that that sounded incredible. (I wouldn't believe it for a second.) At this point, I thought perhaps she was having me on as much as I was having her on, but I didn't really think about it too much, as I often do this sort of thing to Americans, and don't really think much of it. Still, if she was, I'm sure we both had a lot of fun.\n \nAs is the nature of this sort of conversation at Pennsic, we were interrupted as other people came along wanting to ask questions about garb and this and that and the other thing. And so, the lady and I were separated, and I figured that was the end of it, and nothing more would come of it.\n \nTwo days later, this pretty young thing appears before my eyes, sporting a big grin, and says, \"How are your dogs?\"\n \nI looked down at my feet, back at her, and said, \"My who?\"\n \nBy explanation, she said, \"You know, your dogsled team that you left with your friend at the border.\"\n \n\"Ohhhh, them!\" I said in recognition. I shrugged my shoulders and said, \"How should I know?\"\n \nShe continued, \"You could phone your friend and ask.\"\n \n\"Phone?\" I said, as if searching my memory for some long-lost concept. \"Oh! You're talking about the telly-phone!\" Pointing at her, I smiled. \"We don't have telly-phones in Canada. It gets too cold, and the phone lines freeze and break.\"\n \n\"How do you talk to people over long distances?\" she asked.\n \nReassuringly, I clapped her on the shoulder, and in a calm voice, I said, \"Oh, quite simply. We use smoke signals. They may be kind of slow, but the message always gets there. Sometimes it may take a week to get a message across the country, but it does the job well.\" Again, I was thinking that she was having me on., but there was always the glimmer of faith in her eyes, and this did nothing but encourage me to continue. We talked more about snow. I told her we had several hundred words for different kinds of snow. Generally, I laid it on pretty thick.\n \nOnce again, we were separated.\n \nThat night, as with the first night, I went back down to the lake where I was camped, and visited over at Ealdormere Royal (then Principality) and shared with my fellow Ealdormerians the stories of my good fortune in encountering this lady... We laughed a lot. A very lot. After all, having fun with American minds is the Canadian National Pastime. Several of my friends came up with some very good ideas I might have used to expand on my fiction, but I felt that many of them were just too blatantly obviously fallacious. More on that, tomorrow night (the operative word perhaps being \"moron\").\n \nEarly in the afternoon the next day, others of my friends with whom I was camped (Americans), who had also heard the story, came to me pointing to the horizon in the south-east asking what they were saying. Looking where they were pointing, I saw dark smoke billowing up from beyond the trees. Realizing the humour of what they were asking, and the probable truth of what they were saying, I squinted my eyes and slowly, as if reading from a distance, said, \"Help...help...my...car...is...on...fire.\" Impressed all to hell my friends were when, later that night, we found out that someone's car had caught fire on the highway, and that that was most probably it.\n \nHowever, long before discovering that, up in the market area, I was visited once again by the Pretty Young Thing From The South. She said to me that she'd been telling her friends with whom she was camped about all the Canadian things I was telling her and that they were equally as impressed, for none of them had been as far or further from South Carolina as Pennsic. Thinking to myself, I just had to say, \"Lady, your friends are not your friends.\" But I also thought that she was pulling my leg too. So, without anything to lose and years of fun to gain I continued.\n \nSince she wanted to know more I said, \"I've told you about the snow, and all the names we have, and the dogs, but I haven't told you anything about the summer yet. We do have summer, you know. Two weeks!\" I exclaimed, holding up two fingers. \"Three weeks in a good year!\" (Adding another finger.) \"And Lord Tunderin Murphy, but it gets geezly hot, bye. Sometimes it gets up to 35, 36 degrees.\"\n \nA little taken aback, she said, \"My God, that's cold!\"\n \nAs quick as greased lightning, I said, \"Yeah, but it's hot enough to melt your igloo.\" and stroked my beard whimsically as if remembering.\n \n\"I suppose so,\" she said.\n \nNote:\n \nThe Truth about Wallpaper in Igloos\n \n\"Sure,\" I reply. \"And as soon as your igloo starts to melt,\" I continue with a dead serious look on my face, \"you have to get your wallpaper out immediately or it's ruined.\" I looked back at her with an honest smile, and she nodded her head as if it made perfect sense to her. So I went on, driven by this innocent, gullible face. \"So everybody takes out their wallpaper, and hangs it on the trees, and the fences, and the dogsleds, and the dogs,\" I said, trying to make it sound somewhat credible. I put my hand on her shoulder, waved my other hand across the sky, and exclaimed, \"And, my God, you've never seen anything so beautiful as the The Great Canadian Wallpaper Festival! You really must try to get up there some summer. Oh, the colours. Oh, it's just fantastic. Everywhere is light and colour. You really won't find anything like it in the world.\" (Especially in Canada.)\n \nShe gazed back at me with a face that was definitely too full right then...so I continued. Nothing is better done to excess than excess, that's my motto. \"Yes... This is also the time of year when all the young eligible bachelors tie their dogsled teams to their sleds and go cruising around town to see whose old man has got new wallpaper, and what kinds of dower rights you can get. These kinds of things really matter up North, because you really have to know where your wallpaper is. In Canada, wallpaper is almost everything.\"\n \nQuite dumbfounded, she just stood there and nodded slowly. Fortunately for her, some people came by with garb-related questions and anxious faces, and we were separated once more. Again I thought that that was it, that she would catch on, and there would be no more. But what great fun I had!\n \nNow, at this point I must acknowledge the assistance of others. There were many people gathered around. Some would occasionally put their hands on their mouths, withdraw from the circle, run off and laugh somewhere else. Most people seemed to make a good effort not to spoil my fun, and I really appreciate their efforts.\n \nThat night, back at Ealdormere Royal, there were many excellent suggestions for further story embellishment. Probably the most famous (or infamous) came from Kess, who came up with the idea of snow ants. Snow ants, which are of course snow white, and travel in huge packs, are quite invisible against the snow. Usually, the only way to know they're nearby is when moose disappear in a puff of white with a little spattering of red. There is so much more, but I will not bore you with it now. Suffice it to say that we laughed ourselves silly, well past the point where our sides had split. How fortunate were those who were wearing corsets! Of course, they couldn't inhale enough to laugh properly anyway.\n \nI think it was two days later, I ran into the lady again. She recognized me, and wanted to know more. So, I got my shovel ready and started to go. In response to her continued queries, I said, \"Well, I've told you about the short summer, the snows, the igloos, the Wallpaper Festival. There isn't much left. Oh, yes.\" I said, with a glimmer of recollection, \"we do have some permanent wooden structures. There are of course the Parliament Buildings, large wooden box buildings with pyramid roofs and shingles, but they're uninteresting and nothing ever really happens there. However, there are always the moose hatcheries. Probably they're the most remarkable structures in all of Canada.\" (This is where it gets laid on really thick.) I decided not to tell her about the snow ants, but instead to go with something slightly more plausible, like the idea that moose lay eggs. \"Now, a moose hatchery is a truly remarkable building. It's a large, squat, conical building rising up over the horizon like a great, shingled breast with a big door at one end, and a huge pile of sand inside. Some towns have many, some towns only have one, but every Canadian has seen dozens of moose hatcheries and very few have ever been inside one. For that's where the highest-paid civil servants in all the land work.\n \nNote:\n \nThe truth About Moose Hatcheries\n \n\"Once in awhile a moose will walk in from the wilds, usually to the same hatchery in which it was born, walk in the big doors, climb around on the sand pile until it finds the spot that feels right, squat down and pop out an egg the size of a football and then leaves. Moose are terrible parents, unfeeling and unkind.\" I looked at her and said, \"You should be very glad you weren't raised by moose. You'd be a much different person today if you were.\" (Maybe a bit smarter.) \"But anyway, then the hatchery attendants rush in and bury the egg. They turn it every now and then, make sure other moose don't step on it, and after 17 months, the egg hatches. Out comes a medium-cat-sized moose with little one inch antlers. And over the next few months, it gets bigger and stronger, and starts to feel the call of the wild. By the time it's the size of a German Shepherd (with longer legs) it walks up to the door and wanders off into the wild. Most likely, never to be seen again until it comes back to lay its own eggs.\n \n\"We don't know a lot about what they do, but we do know that they live out the rest of the season eating what they eat, and at the end of the season they drop their antlers and overwinter in a huge pack, all huddled together, waiting for the new season, when they get to grow the next set of antlers.\" My face filled with the look of nostalgia. I'm sure I looked as though I was about to wipe a tear from my eye, when she stopped me and said, \"Woah, woah, wait, wait. Are you tellin' me that moose drop their antlers and grow new ones every year?\"\n \n\"Well, yeah,\" I said. \"That is why we call them antlers and not horns, after all.\"\n \nTo this perfectly reasonable assertion on my part, she said, \"No, no, you lie. You are lying to me.\" Just for the record, I'd like to say that this is basically the first true thing I'd told this woman in a whole week, and for some reason, she didn't believe it. Also, though, I was afraid that I was gonna lose my fun, so I tried to rescue the situation, and go off on a ten-minute dissertation on the difference between horns and antlers, and that moose have antlers and that's how they work. But she just wouldn't believe me, no way, no how. And then, in a flash of insight, she said, \"Wait a minute, I remember from high school that moose are mammals.\"\n \nThinking that that may have been the only thing she remembered from high school, I quickly replied, \"The platypus is a mammal. It lays eggs.\" But she was not to be persuaded but I still tried for a few more minutes. Then, sensing that all was lost, I thought the least I could do was set her straight on everything. So I told her the truth about all of it. But she still would not believe that moose antlers drop off and grow back every year.\n \nWell, I like to think there's a moral to this story. Otherwise, why would I keep telling it to people? (Hee hee hee...) I'm sure you can come up with one or two yourself, but my personal fave is \"Sometimes the truth is even more fantastic than a lie.\" But I hope your moral to this story is not, \"Never trust a Tempus, ;)\" because most of the time, if you catch it unawares, a Tempus will be good to you."

It was down mainly to poor management along with a very young staff lacking direction and frankly near bankrupt.\n \nFive of us went in as consultants to get the company \u201ccleaned up\u201d, and to help out we engaged an American (claiming to be a) part qualified accountant. It turned out that he did not have the qualifications that he claimed, nor the European equivalent.\n \nOne of the Consultants was a very young but mature Nigerian chap, who did have qualifications gained in Nigeria and South Africa, but at that time in England not recognised. He was a \u201creal\u201d accountant, i.e. someone who knew what the answers should roughly be, not what a computer told him they should be and know when the latter was wrong. Not run by a computer, but the computer was a tool, but equally knew when that tool was defective !\n \nHe was a mountain of a man, about 6\u2032 3\u2033 and probably the best part of 16 stone\u2026. but muscle and bone; no waste (so to speak); equally one of the most gentle, well mannered person\u2019s you could wish to meet.\n \nHe was doing some pretty serious work on the General Ledger, and some of that was going to directly affect the accounts for that month as well as other implications. The nature of this meant that he had to use some pretty complex Spreadsheet applications and formulae.\n \nThe two main consultants had Degrees in Law and Accountancy respectively and I had a specialisation in insolvency and debt collection to litigation standard. We had another junior member of staff of about 19 years old who was there to help us, mainly through the knowledge she had of the way the company worked before it got in to difficulties. She was good at what she did and extremely helpful but we needed an \u201cin-between\u201d.\n \nThat person was selected by one of the consultants without reference to the others, and it was more to do with nepotism than knowledge between the two. The American lad had a chip on his shoulder made of silicone and thought he was the greatest thing since sliced bread. Actually he was an ignorant, racist, nasty piece of work, (Incidentally I am native, white, English) and regrettably came over as the stereotypical arrogant American.\n \nHe held the assumption, that (in his view) everyone owed America everything. Indeed given that he was probably no more than 25 himself, he actually believed he knew more than everyone else as far as accountancy was concerned and that he was \u201cpack leader\u201d. Unfortunately one of the main consultants actually believed this and treated the boy as his mouth-piece.\n \nWe would frequently have informal staff meetings to keep each other up to date with what was going on, and where additional help (where this American lad, and the Ghanian Accounts Assistant fitted in) was to be deployed.\n \nThe Nigerian man, in his early thirties and was doing some pretty complex work on a spreadsheet, along with an interface with the in-house accounting system. Something that he could not really steer his attention from at the drop of a hat.\n \nThe \u201cleader of the pack\u201d (so to speak) decided to call one of these update meetings. The American lad had been talking to him, and stuck his head out of the office door and said: \u201c OK you guys\u2019 - need to getta [sic] yourselves here now for a meeting !\n \nNnamdii, the Nigerian guy, who was working on this complex spreadsheet just raised his head and said that he would be along shortly. In reality, he did not need to be part of this particular update as it was Credit Control issues that were the main focus of the meeting.\n \nThis American brat, turned on Nnamdii and said: \u201c now listen coon: I told you to get here now so betta [sic] get your arse her or I\u2019ll pound you Nigger: remember America owns you ! \u201c Pointing aggressively at Nnamdii\n \nThe four of us were stunned by the arrogance, near violent behaviour of this American lad, (who frankly could barely add up), not withstanding the incredibly racist statement and the aggressive way it had been delivered.\n \nHowever, there was one thing that this little chap hadn\u2019t bargained on. I don\u2019t think that he had ever seen Nnamdii stand up (in the physical sense) to his full height!\n \nVery calmly, and without shouting, Nnamdii \u201csaved off\u201d the spread sheet, and slowly looking up and over his glasses (he wore rounded spectacles which merely made the matter more intense) very quietly and calmly stood up; almost appearing to expand out of the chair like an inflatable.\n \nHe just pointed to the boy and said \u201cdon\u2019t you ever make such a rude or racist statement like that to me!\u201d ; you arrogant, ignorant little man.\n \nBy this time we were all thinking \u201c that guy is going to be dead- should we call an ambulance or under-taker first?\u201d\n \nThe American lad, just dug himself in to an even deeper pit by turning to the rest of us and saying: \u201c..you can\u2019t let that shit talk to me like that\u2026\u201d .\n \nWe didn\u2019t.\n \nThe Managing Director, having over head the commotion (from a floor away ! ), had walked in to the room, walked up to the boy and in one hand picked up the bag that the brought in to work, and gave it to him; in the other hand pointed to the door, and the only two words used were: \u201cLEAVE. NOW !\u201d\n \nAmazingly this American lad was still protesting that everyone was being unfair to him and should give him another chance (not realising I think that had Nnamdii not lost his temper he he would be dead) he was lucky to be alive in any case.\n \nThe MD just told the boy that he had called the Police and that he was to be escorted off site. For his own safety the boy was escorted out of the room by two other blokes who were in the room at the time and down to reception.\n \nHe was later charged with racial abuse, breaches of the Race Discrimination Act (civil action), Intent to cause an affray and breach of the peace (Criminal), abusive behaviour with intent to endanger life [on the basis had Nnamdii let loose he could have been killed] and that the affray could have caused damage and harm to other people (both Criminal).\n \nImmediately after the Hearing and Conviction, he was expelled to New York via the American Embassy in London. It later came back to us through the Agency that he had had his Passport withdrawn.\n \nAs they say in English Law: \u201ctake your victim as you find them\u201d."

A woman asking for divorce for sexual assault or debauchery sounded disgusting. Homosexuality or transsexuals seemed just as evil. I can go on, but you get the point.\n \nLooking back today, that conflict make me realize how ignorant I am that I had the audacity to judge another person who I know nothing about. My preconceived ideas were so disgusting I had to develop a new set if ideologies, even today as we speak. When I hear someone of another culture say something about mine, it doesn't make me have pity on them anymore, but rather an understanding of my own shortcomings. Every new person makes me feel ignorant in some way or other.\n \nEverytime i blame someone else for their ignorance, I feel I kill off a little bit of my humility."

Everybody turned to look at her since not only did we see footage of the wall being torn down, our teacher passed around a fragment of the wall she collected.\n \nAnother instance with this classmate was when she found out I was from Mexico. She asked me if I spoke Mexican and if it was hard to adjust to riding in a car instead of a donkey cart. I thought at first she was being extremely rude but apparently she thought all of M\u00e9xico was like Hollywood depicts it in Western movies.\n \nThis is about another person in my high school:\n \nI was at my desk reading since I had gotten to class early and was still waiting for the teacher to arrive. A group of boys entered and were conversing loudly amongst themselves. The topic they were discussing was their experiences dealing with the foreign exchange students they were hosting. One in particular was boasting how the English students had never tried Mexican cuisine before so in order to introduce them, they took them to Taco Bell\u2026. At hearing this I started cursing under my breath in Spanish which brought my presence to their attention.\n \n\u201cOh, you're like Mexican right? Do you have any good hard shell taco brands you can recommend? My mom wants to cook them a taco casserole.\u201d\n \nI blinked slowly and counted in my head.\n \n\u201cHard taco shells are not considered Mexican, they are Tex Mex and no it is not the same thing. Buy white corn tortillas if you want to expose them to Mexican food\u201d\n \nI brought them the next day a jar of my mom\u2019s salsa. They told me it was too spicy for them but that it was good.\n \nUpdate:\n \nI forgot one more story possibly because it was so embarrassing I tried to block it.\n \nI took a swimming class in high school instead of taking regular PE. I grew up taking swimming lessons year round so changing in the locker room without a towel wrapped around me for modesty never occurred to me to do since we were all girls there. As I was pulling my swimsuit over my chest I felt hands grasp my arms and was twisted to face a classmate. She kept staring at my chest, freaking me out. She starts yelling \u201cOMG your nipples are brown!!! I didn't know there were brown nipples! Why aren't your nipples pink? Did you burn them?\u201d\n \nThis of course brought forth other white girls who wanted to continue to ogle in amazement in nipples of another color.\n \nYou would've thought that after that I would have changed with a towel wrapped around me but I only had 15 min to dry myself, change and run to the other side of the building for my next class and keeping the towel around you while you try to shimmy with wet legs into skinny jeans is too much of a hassle. By the third day I wasn't (or rather my areolas) a novelty anymore and was able to change in peace."

And I don't want to hurt your feelings. I respect that \nyou\n believe what you believe. I just don't see eye-to-eye with you.\n \nAs for the rest of you who are still here, I'll get to describing the venue:\n \nThe Reverend had rented a large community center/gymnasium out in a rural area, beyond the subdivisions and where the busses stopped running after dark.\n \nIt was in Chico, California. At that time, Playboy magazine had named it college party city #1 in the USA, so I was a bit worried about how I was going to find my way back into town, in the dark, when I was at\n \u201cground zero\u201d\n with all the \nfreaks\n in town.\n \nI entered the building. I was early, with plenty of time to kill, as I'd taken the last bus out on the route, and it was still two hours 'til \u201cshow time.\u201d\n \nI was met at a reception table\n,\n and asked to fill out an information card.\n \nIt asked my name, address, ailments, worries, how many children I had, financial status, and basically all the information any reasonably \u201cpsychic\u201d faith healer would need to know about a person in order to pull off a convincing show.\n \nA-HA! Gotcha!\n \nI got my seat assignment and sat down.\n \nFront row. Next to a nice old couple. She, in a wheelchair. We had a couple hours to shoot the breeze as the room filled up.\n \nNice folks.\n \nAt one point she needed to use the facilities and asked that I wheel her to the Ladies Room.\n \nI obliged.\n \nRelieved, I watched her get up and \nwalk\n out of her chair\n,\n and enter the stall. At one point I worried I might have to go in there with her and help her out, but she was fine on her own.\n \nShe could walk.\n \nThe show started right on time.\n \nThe Reverend Saul David was introduced, as the band geared up and played some \nwonderful\n gospel tunes and he danced around, waving his arms, bobbing his blonde head, smiling (even as his eyebrows were scowling in a creepy way) and everybody clapped their hands and praised Jesus. That was the fun part!\n \nThe music was \ndelicious\n. Rich. Inspiring. I'm still a fan of gospel and learned a lot of technique that night. You wouldn't know if you heard me play piano, that I wasn't raised a Southern Baptist. I took to the style like a duck to water. It exudes essence, and soul, and truly touches me. I love the music!\n \nBut then the music \nstopped\n.\n \nThe fun ended. I suddenly found myself being held hostage for \nhours\n. A lot of \nboring\n talking.\n Preaching. Fire and Brimstone.\n \nBlah blah blah. \nMy eyes glazed over. I wanted to leave, but like I said, I was in the middle of nowhere, way out of town. It was dark, and I really didn't know exactly where I was.\n \nThe freakiest part of the evening came when the good 'ol Rev started picking people out of the audience.\n \n\u201cThere is someone here,\u201d he began, \u201csomeone who recently lost a son. And God wants you to know, \nSully\n, that \nTony\n is beside him in Heaven and is just fine.\u201d\n \nAnd Sully would whoop and weep. Relieved that his kid was okay in the Afterlife.\n \n\u201cSomeone here has been suffering from arthritis. \nLily\n has owned a bakery for years and can no longer knead her bread!\u201d\n \nAt which point, my seat neighbor, the one I'd taken to the Lady's room, let out a startled gasp, and put her hand over her lips in astonishment! She was eating that stuff up.\n \nThe Reverend made his way over to our row and grabbed onto the old woman's head and started speaking gibberish, \n\u201cLoobagoda Brigga Nighga Shwopa-fumanigha poo Veggie lool roog bon FWEEEEEE!\u201d\n \n(My eyes went wide. I was suddenly frightened.)\n \n\u201cIN THE NAME OF JEEEZUS-AH, YOU WILL BE HEEEEELED, NOWA! Stand up and WALK!\u201d \nHe \nscreamed\n directly into her face, and I watched, bird's eye view, as \nspittle\n flew from his mouth, into her open eyes and drenched her face.\n \nShe was weeping as she stood, wobbly at first, then raising her arms started walking up and down the aisles!\n \nThe congregation erupted. Talking in tongues, arms raised, standing, stomping\n,\n as the organ chimed in and accompanied such an amazing \u201c\nmiracle\u201d \ntaking place!\n \nThe Reverend took her wheelchair\n,\n and kicked it, \nactually kicked it, \naway (I was hoping the old lady got it back later.)\n \nOh, the tears did flow!\n \nAt the end of the evening, the Reverend, tired of making fake predictions by getting information fed to him in his secreted earpiece from the cards we'd filled out before the \u201cshow\u201d started, had us all line up and went down the queue, \u201chealing\u201d us one-by-one.\n \nHe was grabbing heads and \nliterally\n pushing people backwards into the arms of his assistants. When he got to me I didn't fall over, I \nresisted, held my ground\n and I laughed in his face.\n \nHe looked pissed off.\n \nLuckily, he didn't point out I was possessed by the devil or anything, or I might have been torn to shreds by the fanatics in that room!\n \nFinally, after four hours of exhausting bullshit, it was over.\n \nPeople were gladly handing over a good portion of their paychecks at the reception table as they filed out of the room.\n \nLeaving the show, I ended up collecting my jacket from my seat. I met the old couple there, and said farewell.\n \nI watched them as they slowly began to walk away, the husband escorting his fragile wife as she painfully took each step and leaned heavily on his arm.\n \n\u201cDon't you want your wheelchair?\u201d I asked, as I pointed to it, still sitting in the corner, where the Reverend had kicked it earlier during his sermon.\n \nShe looked me straight in the eye and said:\n \n\u201cOh no! I've been \nhealed by our Lord, Jesus Christ!\n I will never sit in \nthat\n thing again!\u201d\n \n..And off toddled the most ignorant American I've ever met."

What\u2019s the GDP of Venezuela?\u201d and made snide remarks on how Venezuela was basically a backwater country.\n \nI found him even more annoying after then.

Anyway, let me get to my story.\n \nI was commenting on a question where I was asked \n\u201cHow are you treated by others because of your nationality?\u201d\n I was curious to see what others wrote, so I did the same. I had commented that I had been called slurs, been looked at differently because of my ethnicity, or asked to be more \u201cAmerican\u201d because I have a light accent and I speak Spanish. I can tolerate all of that nonsense. However, what really struck me was a comment I got saying:\n \n\u201cAre you even Mexican? I find it offensive to some people that you are acting as a certain nationality when you clearly are not.\u201d\n \nThis infuriated me. 1. This person doesn't know me to save their life and 2. It feels as if they were basically stripping me of my heritage and my culture!!\n \nI was not happy. I responded with \u201cwhat makes you think I'm not Mexican?\u201d\n \nThey jab back saying \u201cI looked at your profile picture. You have brown hair, blue eyes, and your name isn\u2019t even Hispanic.\u201d By this point I wanted to choke this person out.\n \nI ended the conversation with \u201cI think it's funny how you apparently know more about me that I do myself. First off, I'm Mexican. I was born in Mexico to Mexican parents. I've been raised with the Mexican culture. Also, I think it's quite funny how you think that all Mexicans are supposed to look brown, with black hair and dark eyes. Screw you.\u201d Also, my last name is Italian. I\u2019ll share my last name because that won\u2019t give me away. My last name is \nV\u00eda\n. Which comes from Italy. My first name is from English descent. I explained how there are millions of Mexicans with Italian last names, German last names, English and Irish last names, and even Chinese last names. This even explaining how I know many Mexicans with first names from other ethnic origin besides Hispanic. Good day to that sir."

He was actually an open minded teacher and I don't think he was trying to come across as ignorant but he did.\n \nA lot of people don't realize that when you migrate to the United States, 99% of people want a better life. They are usually escaping from something that is destroying the quality of their life. Middle Eastern run from extremists as well as poverty and lack of choices. Mexican are running from poverty, gang violence, and much more. Syrians are running from their OWN government. Everyone wants a better quality of life so they run from a country that no longer allows them to be physically or emotionally comfortable. So accusing them to be terrorists and rapists only makes the situation worse for them and they feel unaccepted in a new country that they were hoping would provide them new opportunities; where they won't feel threatened by the environment around them.\n \nIt's sad. It lets you down. Immigrants are grateful for this nation more than its own natural citizens. We come here and we work HARD. We become entrepreneurs, encourage our children to do better in school because not all of us had the opportunity to go to school, we pay taxes and help this country's economy. No one is more grateful for this nation than the immigrants because we know what this country means to us. We have lived in hell before. If I think United States is paradise, then why would I want anyone to threaten my paradise?\n \nI have met ignorant people through out my life each more ignorant than the other. I also meet people that welcome me and are grateful for my presence as I am for theirs. They understand the struggle my family and I have gone through.\n \nI am proud to say that my parents has built a beautiful life for themselves. We never were offered government assistance and we never asked for it either. I had to get FAFSA for school and it was not a grant it was a loan. We never have lived under welfare. It took us 13 years to finally get a visa to move here. We didn't magically get invited. My family was thoroughly wetted. Inspectors surprise visited our home for an inspection multiple times. Paper work over paperwork and interview over interview. Questions like these were asked: Why did we want to come to the US?, What are our intentions?, How were we going to support ourselves?, Why didn't we want to stay where we were? What did we have to offer the United States?, And hours worth of more questions.\n \nIf we didn't want to better our lives, we would have not gone through the struggle that it took to get here. In no way do I or my family intends to harm the US or it's people. Yet people choose to not understand that. It's easier to say that we are harmful and threatening than to understand that we just want to LIVE.\n \nI guess I experienced more ignorance in school than outside of school because kids aren't afraid to express themselves and what they hear from their parents."

Of course we're Canandian! and laughed awkwardly. The woman says to us 'But you sound American..where are your accents?'\n \nFirst of all, very rarely will you meet someone with a 'Canadian' accent. The 'accent' most Americans refer to stem from the Maritimes (Atlantic provinces) and even then, many do not have an accent. We are a bilingual country so some residents of Quebec and northern Ontario will have a slight 'Quebecois' accent (similar to a French accent, but distinctly different). Not all Canadians end their sentences in 'eh' and we don't all sound like we were born and raised in some small town in the Atlantic.\n \nSecondly, the American accent can be from the deep South, or unique like Minnesota and Boston. Even the Southern accent differs from state to state (I have a hard time understanding anyone from small town West Virginia). So I was really confused as to what American accent she thought we would have since your accents differs from region to region.\n \nThirdly, I'm a Toronto native. Toronto \u2014 a melting pot of cultures. Toronto \u2014 one of the most diverse cities in this country. Toronto \u2014 where we don't have a specific accent because our city speaks about 100 different languages."

Another scamster!\n \nShe: No, he is legit, he is a university professor!\n \nJoe: \nOh I\u2019m sure he is! \n(stupid sarcastic tone ensues\u2026)\n \nMe: hahaha\u2026 Actually, he has a PhD from Berkeley.\n \nJoe: \nPhD from where? Berklee College of Music?\n \nMe: hahaha\u2026 No, from UC Berkeley. He wrote an award winning PhD thesis!\n \nJoe: \nOh I\u2019m sure, he has many awards!\n \nMe: hahaha.. If you are interested, you can look him up. His name is Mahan Mj.\n \nJoe gives the most stupid ass look and rotates his head around that certain Americans give, which roughly means \u201cNah\u2026 I don\u2019t buy that!\u201d\n \nAt this point, I was a few seconds away from my natural reflex to such ignorant people: A small pause with quiet intent look at his eyes; a huge laugh, followed by \u201cAre you a mathematician?\u201d But, his wife knows how he has been making an ass of himself and this is a bit too much! She intervenes: nudges him about getting the food from the food-truck!\n \nJane: Hey, why don\u2019t you take a look for the food? I think this one is ours!\n \nJoe wants to continue this stupid conversation but gets verbally arm twisted by Jane, and stumbles to go ahead and take a look at the food truck.\n \nAs he goes away\u2026\n \nJane (to me and my date): \nDon\u2019t worry, I got you! (laughing with an embarrassed look)\n \nWe (Jane, my date and me) just look at each other laugh! I hope Joe is thankful to Jane, who saves the situation. He was seconds away from being humiliated. May be Joe is a nice guy, who just suffers from verbal diarrhoea at times. I don\u2019t know. But, he does remind me one of those ignorant uncles in the family who are found in many Indian gatherings of extended families, who speak in very similar ways, and make an ass of themselves in front of everyone. I guess this was another step towards the belief: \nPeople are not that different after all!\n \nNB: \nIn case you are wondering, I was talking about Mahan Maharaj who writes as Mahan Mj. Here is his professional homepage: \nMahan Mj\n \nHonorable mentions:\n \nConversation 1:\n \nRandom old man in a shopping mall interrupts me.\n \nHe: Hey, Indian guy! Can you help me fix my computer? (with a stupid smirk in his face..)\n \nUsually, I would say, very dry manner: yeah, very funny. But this time, I changed it a little.\n \nMe: I don\u2019t know how to use a computer. (deadpan poker face)\n \nHe: What..? Really? (eyes getting bigger)\n \nMe: That\u2019s right. I know nothing about computers. Cannot even switch them on. I\u2019m a mathematician.\n \nHe: Really? (Eyes becoming so big, about to pop out of his face!)\n \nConversation 2:\n \nMe: Yay! I finally got the Social Security Number!\n \nAmerican acquaintance from Math department: \nWhy do you have Social Security Number! You are not a citizen! \n(sudden palpable rage in his voice)\n \nMe: Dude! I need this to pay my income tax here! Everyone has it! All grad students, all people who get stipend or salary!\n \nHim: Huh.. really?\n \nNB: Good lord! This is a future American mathematician! He says he might want to become an investment banker. So, I was wondering, may be one day, he will be a US Secretary of the Treasury and make policies.\n \nConversation 3:\n \nAmerican trying to defend Trump\u2019s Muslim Ban: \nBut, I-Ran is a state sponsor of terrorism! \n(..rage in her voice)\n \nMe: Do you know where the 9/11 terrorists came from?\n \nShe: I-ran?\n \nMe: Nope. Saudi Arabia.\n \nShe: Huh\u2026 really?\n \n[No wonder he still thinks Trump has a master plan how to make \u2018Murica great again! Funny thing is, his mother is an immigrant. But, yeah you guessed it right, she is a European immigrant with blonde hair and blue eyes from Sweden. Makes \nsense\n!]\n \nNB: It sounds very stupid how Americans pronounce Iran like \u201cI ran!\u201d. For one last time, folks, it\u2019s okay if you really ran, but it\u2019s not \u201cI ran\u201d.\n \nConversation 4:\n \nThis is heard from an Indian friend who went on a first date with a White American girl.\n \nShe: Were you in a relationship before?\n \nHe: Yeah, I had a girlfriend when I was in Mumbai. But, it didn\u2019t work out.\n \nShe: I\u2019m so sorry to hear that. Why? What happened?\n \nHe: She was very much into partying and clubbing. It was fun for a few months at first, but after a point, I felt fatigued. I don\u2019t like to party and go out clubbing every weekend. And she didn\u2019t like travelling or anything else I would prefer to do on weekends. So, we grew apart gradually and this create a rift between us\u2026\n \nShe: Indian girl? \nPartying? They have clubs there? [eyes bursting out\u2026]\n \nReference:\n \nWhat To Know About Shakespeare On The Common \u2014 And Why To Take The Kids"

He thought that all English People wore bowler hats and either spoke like Dame Maggie Smith or spoke like in absurd cockney accents like Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. Thinking we all said \u201cELLO GOVNER\u201d in a start of a sentence in a East London Accent. So he (the American) went up to his brother and said:\n \n\u201cDude, did you know this guys speaks English!\u201d Pointing at me.\n \nI don't know how you cant he ignorant when you don't even know your own language.\n \nIt was probably the most funny or most depressing thing I saw in my life depending on how you saw it."

When approached one woman said she voted for that nice black boy, wow really? But as she was also black it wasn't considered a major slip of the tongue.\n \nThe next question they asked her was, \u201cSo you are okay with his choice for vice president Sarah Palin?\u201d To which she replied that Obama and Palin would complement each other wonderfully.\n \nI used to work at the White House back during Reagan and Bush41. I had an apolitical role in communications. One time during the summer tourist season we went out with a professional camcorder and asked people who George Bush was, only 1 in 10 knew who the vice president was.\n \nSo we switched the question to who was Ronald Reagan. Only 3 in 10 knew he was the President, with a few more saying he was an actor. It is hard to believe that people standing right outside the White House didn't know who Reagan was.\n \nI guess it says a good thing that we have a country where who is POTUS is not shoved down our throats. I'm pretty sure that 99.99% of NK know their leader is Little Kim.\n \nADDITIONALLY, MY Uncle by marriage falls into this category. He is originally is from New York State, UT moved to the south after he met and married my aunt, while on active duty with the Air Force in the late 60\u2019s. I don't know where the man learned the NK word, but he manages to work it into conversations every third sentence or so. It is disgusting, I refused to allow my children to hear him speak.\n \nSo when the 2008 presidential campaign was under way he naturally was campaigning for Obama, wait WTF? I asked him why and he said, \u201cmy union says I should vote and campaign for the useless n@#/er\u201d. I can't really explain it other than he was a big union supporter."

The bad scenario is that its central district is completely overrun by tourists. But despite hearing far more English than Italian, it\u2019s still possible to get a little bit of a feel for Florentine culture and history.\n \nEverything was going according to the plan. We had randomly chosen a restaurant, and had enjoyed a nice meal. I went to the restroom to\u2026 make room for more wine.\n \nThis restaurant had one door to both men\u2019s and women\u2019s bathrooms, then obviously individual doors for each gender beyond that. (I can\u2019t remember why this made sense, but it did. Maybe there was only one sink in the \u201cantechamber\u201d for both bathrooms?) The exterior door was labelled \u201cbagni\u201d (\u201cbathrooms\u201d) and the interior doors were labeled \u201cdonna\u201d and \u201cuomo.\u201d I won\u2019t translate those two exotic terms, for reasons that will be soon be evident. But for now, pause for just a moment and take a guess\u2026 a wild conjecture\u2026 as to what those two terms mean.\n \nI\u2019ll give you a hint. At the moment I was heading to the bathroom, there was a woman who stood in apparent paralysis inside the \u201cbagni\u201d door, but outside the \u201cuomo\u201d and \u201cdonna\u201d doors. A man then emerged from the \u201cuomo\u201d door. The woman remained, utterly confused. She wondered aloud, \u201cwhich door do I use?\u201d, not necessarily talking \nto\n me, but perhaps hoping I could help.\n \nI did. I directed her to the \u201cdonna\u201d door. I can only assume she found the relief she was looking for, as did I inside the \u201cuomo\u201d door.\n \nI came back to my seat and relayed all this to my wife. She was as perplexed as I was, how someone could get so far \u2014 to plan a trip to Italy, to get on a plane, to make it from some airport or another all the way to the center of Florence \u2014 without somehow picking up a \nlittle\n vocabulary. And even if she literally just woke up magically transported from her home in \u2018merica to this restaurant, how she couldn\u2019t put it together that a \nman\n \nwalked out of one of the doors\n.\n \nAs I wrapped up my brief narrative, I saw her emerge from the bathroom and take her seat. Turned out, that seat was right next to us. She then explained, exasperated, the intricate system at play in the restroom to her traveling companion, who I can only assume was her husband. I don\u2019t remember all of what followed, but for the first time I was really embarrassed to be an American. The depth of their collective ignorance was really quite staggering."

As diplomatically as I could, I explained that all the materials on Joan of Arc were checked out, and recommended she pick someone else. The mother asked who, and I suggested St. Thomas Aquinas. When the woman asked who he was, I explained that he was the greatest of the Catholic philosophers and theologians. Well, this woman looked at me like I had told her she stunk. She told me, \u201cMy daughter ain\u2019t doin\u2019 no paper on no Catholic!\u201d. Then she said to her daughter, \u201cc\u2019mon honey, let\u2019s go get you some books on Joan of Arc,\u201d and stormed out."

The mother than asks me would I mind if her daughter could feel my horns. It was clear there was no malice involved, just boundless ignorance. I explained to her that no, we do not have horns, so there is nothing to feel.\n \nAs a former South African, I\u2019ve also had the pleasure of been asked by Americans how come I\u2019m not Black if I\u2019m from Africa, and was it dangerous there because of all the lions everywhere.\n \nEven my American wife, who is reasonably intelligent, and well educated (degrees from two good colleges a notch below the Ivy League), and grew up in a upper middle class family who lived in a fairly affluent neighborhood of a large and sophisticated city (NY) can sometimes surprise me with flashes of ignorance. Several times I\u2019ve had to correct her about American history. Clearly American education is in a bad way."

I was exhausted from my 5 hour shift and was almost asleep in the backseat of the cab. As I was resting my eyes, I felt the dreadful arrow of small talk approaching me. Polite person that I am, I gave in and pretended to be interested. So, this driver (who is american) starts talking how he is majoring in psychology and discussing my field of interest. When he heard I was from India, he seemed be to excited and then he uttered something that most indians hear in a foreign country. \u201cI always wanted to visit India and see Taj Mahal.\u201d As a respected citizen of India, I started telling him more about India and how we have other tourist spots as well. Then he went ahead and said something that made me go \u201cWhaaaa?! Really?!\u201d and jerked me off my sleepy state. He said, \u201cIndia is also known for Burj Khalifa right? That building looks extravagant. Have you ever been there? Where does your parents live? In Dubai? Which part of India is Dubai in? North?\u2026. $%&^$##$^$&%^\u201d. I rolled my eyes so hard, was about to go blind. I let him rant because I was in no mood to give him a geography lecture. He kept muttering something for the rest of the drive and I gave him a periodic \u201cAhaan! I see\u201d \u201cO Really\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s great\u201d!!\n \nMy point being you cannot afford to be educated enough to have an advanced degree and suck so hard in geography. To me you are this huge ignorant person, who just doesn\u2019t care to peep outside the borders of his own country."

I find this local station which is going around random people's houses where their cars are due to be repossessed as they haven't paid. As the car is in the process of being hoisted up on the tow truck they knock on the door and offer the owner the chance of getting their car back debt free provided they answer one question correctly.\n \nObviously this being America everyone gives it a go. The question on this particular day was\n \nPresenter: Which continent is France on?\n \nA: Damn man, I dunno, I think it's south or east\u2026\u2026\n \nPresenter: I'm going to have to push you for an answer here\n \nA: South, yeah man, it's definitely South Continent\n \nAt this point I think you could have scraped my jaw off from the floor. To not know where France is I can sort of understand, but to not even know the name of any continent\u2026 well I've never ever seen that even in Cornwall where I met a guy who had never even crossed the river Tamar!"

I am being very polite, which I suggest as a basic approach when you don\u2019t understand what you are seeing. I get done listening to the Choir practice (Practices are open for free listening, or they were then, and it was GREAT).\n \nI decide to go look at this other building with dioramas in it. I figure out they are based on Scenes From Scripture, and I can identify the Old and New Testament scenes, but I\u2019m quite lost on the ones from the Book of Mormon.\n \nI am stopped in front of a scene. A man is sitting in a chair, at a desk, with a flip-a-page desk calendar on it, model about 1930 to 1970, sheets mounted on central U brads, but made of something like a brassy version of tinfoil rather than paper. He is dressed as a Mayan, and there are cubbyholes built into a wall behind him, filled with clay tablets covered in cuneiform writing. There are patterns like Mayan glyphs painted on the wall to mark the cubbyholes. This looks to me like a complete archaeological mash-up.\n \nAt this point, one of the local insiders walks up with a friend, gestures to the scene, and proclaims, \u201cSee? This proves everything in (Scripture) is true!\u201d\n \nShe means that the written scripture, first published in English in the 1800s, is proved scientifically verifiable by a diorama constructed in the late 1900s. Now, if she were talking about something I know about, and expect has a historical basis, say the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, it wouldn\u2019t be proved to have happened because somebody put together a museum exhibit about it after the fact. I am not familiar with the story she is referencing, but it will follow the same rules as to evidence. It will take archaeology and cross references, not just a realistic looking artist\u2019s conception \nbased on the book itself\n, to \nstart\n into evidence territory.\n \nThis stunning display of literal minded concrete thinking has me almost physically dizzy. If I were a cartoon character, springs would be sticking out of my head, waving about and making accordion noises.\n \nI stand there thinking, she is probably a nice person to her family and neighbors. For the love of Mike, keep your trap shut. I manage to reel back outside, without speaking, fortunately, and try to figure out all the self-referential permutations of wackiness in her statement. I\u2019m still not sure I have a grasp on that.\n \nIt isn\u2019t that it was about a religion I don\u2019t understand that made the statement so staggering to me, but the utter lack of understanding of how to establish whether something is real. It was a 3 year old sort of statement coming out of a middle aged person.\n \nI wonder if I sound similar to physicists. I know my grasp of physics sometimes seems to be based on Road Runner cartoons."

But nevertheless, as an American, I will answer.\n \nMy 12 year old son's father, by far! We split & he had full custody for a short time, before it graduated into joint custody. During this time, my son was enrolled into kindergarten. His father was telling me, quite proudly, about the process of enrolling him into kindergarten, \u2018since I had never done so\u2019. He was simply boasting at the fact that he had full custody (at that point in time), & telling me about how they require medical insurance information for enrollment.\n \nI said \u201cThat's just a section on the form to fill in, in case there is a playground accident or something & he has to be taken to the hospital- so they have the info to present the hospital, or if there is a specific hospital that he needs to be taken to\u201d. He adamantly rebutted what I said, since \u2018I have never enrolled anybody in kindergarten, so I obviously wouldn't know what is necessary\u2019. He truly thought/thinks that medical insurance was a necessary requirement to be enrolled in kindergarten! I tried to explain, saying \u201cIt is a federal requirement for children to attend school from 5-16 (+ or - in different states). With that being the case, how could the government possibly hold a 5yr old accountable for his parents\u2019 having/not having medical insurance? That's insane! \u201c.\n \nHe continued to insist that indeed it is necessary for every 5 year old to have medical insurance to be enrolled in kindergarten. I then said \u201cWhat about illegal aliens?\u201d. As we live in California, there are many illegal aliens enrolled in school, enrolled in University (many times with scholarship), working jobs, living in apartments, etc. He answered \u201cIllegal aliens don't send their kids to school\u201d. Crazy!! We live in the midst of a lot of them, from places near & far alike (Mexico, China, India, Guatemala, Cambodia, Vietnam, Korea, Eritrea, etc.).\n \nNo matter what I did, I could not convince him that 5yr olds can't be held accountable for making sure that their parents have provided medical insurance for them, so that they can go to a state-mandated institution.\n \nThe scary part? This man is vice president of Engineering in the tech company he works for. And this is not a mom & pop, fly-by-night company."

One Proposer and Seconder from each side of the debate (Pro and Anti) to state their proposition , followed by Q and A with the audience. Following what I believe is an almost Universal practice amongst School debating clubs, the \u201cPro\u201d team and the \u201cAnti\u201d team picked their preference at the start of the debate so all teams would have to be well read on BOTH sides of the argument and be prepared to back up their arguments EVEN WHEN the proposition was against their personal beliefs.\n \nOne of these was on the subject of Nuclear Arms and the arguments for and against Nuclear Weapons as a whole. I was seconding a guy called Nigel (the Head Boy) and a friend of Mine, Eddie, was seconding Peter the Deputy Head Boy. We were Pro (or the dirty, stinking Warmongers) and Eddie and Peter were Anti Nuclear Arms (God\u2019s favourite children). The result, a forgone conclusion, but, hey, a good excuse for a nice, dirty, verbal scrap.\n \nThings became heated and rules of courtesy and tact disappeared as immoderate statements were made by each team (and their supporters) impugning the motives, ethics and morals of the Opposition. During this period, Eddie and I got into one of these verbal \u2018scrap\u2019 and I was asked by him what I would do if I heard the famous \u201cFour Minute Warning\u201d sound across the Town.\n \nI retorted, quick as a flash \u201c\u201dI\u2019ve read all about the things we are likely to expect in a Post Holocaust World, and I wouldn\u2019t want to stay here and watch it happen. If that Missile was falling on Maesteg, then I\u2019d want to try and get directly underneath it\u2026.\u201d.\n \nEddie laughed. It was a scornful laugh. It expressed a depth of contempt for my words that, quite frankly, hurt a little. When his laughter had subsdided, he looked at me and said, EVEN MORE scornfully :-\n \n\u201cStand underneath it ???!!! Do you KNOW how much those fuckers WEIGH ???\u201d"

Over the years she has provided me with ample material to supply a ready answer any time I\u2019m asked about the most insanely inane and extraordinarily moronic things I\u2019ve ever heard in life. I spent three weeks traveling around the Pacific Rim in 2006 and China was one of several counties I visited. While talking with this second cousin of mine shortly after the trip I was casually mentioning something about my time in Beijing that somehow (I don\u2019t remember the exact detail) alluded to the fact I had breakfast at the hotel where I was staying, at which point she had to stop to interrupt me with her astonished (and astonishing) remark. Mind you, I\u2019m not describing the reaction of a child, but the reaction of an adult. An adult who certainly never traveled beyond her own borders, but an adult homo sapien, all the same. She was so astonished to find out that people eat breakfast in China\u2026 As in\u2014 she was astonished, as in\u2014 she found it hard to believe that the concept of \u2018breakfast,\u2019 having a meal in the morning hours that is actually part of a routine and actually gets an official title for it as the equivalent of \u201cbreakfast.\u201d\n \nLet\u2019s stop for a moment to consider this mindset\u2014 and while meaning no cruelty or disdain for this mindset, I am okay having a little bit of fun with it.\n \nYou mean to inform me that breakfast exists in China? As in that super-far-away country with well over a billion people and one of the oldest civilizations in world history dating back to the Shang Dynasty around 1600 BC\u2014 they got breakfast over there, for real? No way!!! The same people who created the Great Wall and the Terra Cotta warriors, who gave us the I Ching, Taoism, acupuncture, not to mention all the tea\u2014 they were ingenious enough to conceive of having something like lunch or dinner in the morning time, like a whole meal to start the day? Like they really have breakfast, the real thing, not something just kind of similar? Are they just copying us? Is breakfast just another American implant over there like the Disneylands in Shanghai and Hong Kong? Or did these folks really come up with such a thing on their own? You mean to tell me the people who invented paper, silk, gunpowder, printing, the compass, the kite, the umbrella, and all that other stuff were actually sophisticated enough to think that having something like an ordinary meal in the morning made sense? How weird that people all over the world could seriously think of doing the same thing before noon that would involve food\u2014 and not just once as a fluke\u2014 but EVERY DAY. Wow. How do these things happen? Very interesting coincidence.\n \nI can only hope that maybe I was more astonished by her than she was by that. But I guess that wouldn\u2019t be all too redeeming either\u2026\n \nLike wow, you mean we don\u2019t just do that over here??? People consume morning meals in other places around this strange world? Do they sleep and go to the bathroom too? What about the birds and the bees on that side of the world? Is it actually the stork for real over there who brings the babies or do those foreign people get to make them babies the same way as us folks over here?\n \nI could also mention that this same second cousin has said many other things to me that were spectacular in their own way and have left me stunned speechless in quite different scenarios yet similar outrageously vacuous terms. After divorcing her first husband and telling me about what happened, she explained to me that what really messed up their marriage of less than 2 years was her mother coming home to find my second cousin\u2019s husband having sex with another woman. She made sure to clarify for me that with all the shock involved about this scandalous display of infidelity discovered in flagrante delicto was simply a bridge too far. You see the problem here for her wasn\u2019t the fact that her husband was cheating on her. No, no. It was perfectly fine if he cheated on her anywhere else in the universe indoors outdoors upstairs downstairs in public or private with or without consent with a thousand different women from every country on earth so long as he didn\u2019t do it somewhere her mother would see it, somewhere like her home. So the divorce sounded more like Mom\u2019s friendly suggestion than her own idea. My cousin told me the guy she married was always cheating on her, but that alone wasn\u2019t a sufficient reason to divorce him. Who would be so shallow to even think of such a thing? For such a minor offense, really. Sounds a bit like overreacting. Cheating couldn\u2019t be anything more than like a misdemeanor in the marriage world, right? Now something like forgetting an anniversary might be a felony, but cheating? Divorcing someone over some kind of infidelity would be just like giving the death penalty to someone for j-walking.\n \nShe said while a lot of people had even gone so far as to suggest something like she should divorce the guy for being a habitual, unhindered, remorseless cheater, she didn\u2019t see it this way from her enlightened perspective. I recall how she capped this off by saying, ever so glibly and almost in a huffy sort of way, without a whiff of reflection or even the faintest iota of critical thinking that could, you know, maybe randomly occur by accident: \u201cOh no, you don\u2019t leave someone for cheating. You just work through it.\u201d\n \nRight. It sounds like a small communication error after all, and can be fixed rather speedily. Maybe just start talking a little bit more between each of his short and maybe often extensive outings (vacations, cruises, Sunset Blvd, maybe a few Turkish style harems including sex sprees with his worldwide sprawl of liaisons).\n \nIn all seriousness, though, there does seem to be a somewhat intriguing rationale worth considering here. Nothing wrong with my cousin to be able to look at the bigger picture. Maybe if the person caused a genocide, divorce would be justifiable. Compared to that, infidelity seems a bit trivial. I mean, look at this way, as some mother might put it in her sage advice, or better yet, a Solomonic marriage counselor: \u201cYeah you\u2019re married to a chronic cheater\u2014 but at least he isn\u2019t Hitler or Stalin. He wants sex with more people in his life, but does that really make him such a bad guy? Look on the bright side, he\u2019s not wanting to exterminate an entire ethnic group!\u201d\n \nThis same second cousin also happened to make another noteworthy utterance the day of my grandfather/ her great-grandfather\u2019s funeral. It was especially noteworthy because she said this to me that day and neither of us were actually at the funeral (which was out of state and I was unable to attend for various reasons) but actually just ran into each other by chance in the parking lot of the mall. I thought it was odd enough that the day of my grandfather\u2019s funeral, when I felt sad about not being at the funeral where my parents and many extended family members were, I just happened to see a relative of mine from the same side of the family at the mall. Well, my second cousin had her own way of making this slightly, yet unforgettably odder. Naturally, seeing as how we just randomly ran into one another and it was the day of our grand/great grandfather\u2019s funeral, that was immediately brought up\u2026 I think I just said something like, \u201cCrazy about grandpa huh?\u201d\n \nShe started off with, \u201cYeah, how do you feel about what\u2019s happened with grandpa?\u201d\n \nAt which point I said something, which I\u2019m sure would be just about the same kind of answer as anyone would give about how they feel losing one of their grandparents\u2026 I could\u2019ve messed with her and said, \u201cOh I feel great. Dead grandfather. It\u2019s wonderful!\u201d But no, I wasn\u2019t in the humorous mood and said something sincere, like, \u201cOh yeah, really sad.\u201d\n \nBut it was her response to this that really took me by surprise, when she said, \u201cI hear he\u2019s getting better.\u201d\n \nI was too dumbfounded with disbelief to come up with any notable response. I think I just said matter-of-factly, \u201cHis funeral is today.\u201d\n \nIn retrospect, a better (or funnier and more sardonic) response to say I gave would\u2019ve been something like: \u201cReally? You hear he\u2019s getting better? Interesting. Cuz I was told he died and that the funeral is actually being held today and that my parents are actually up there attending it as we speak\u2026 Maybe I should call them and double-check. You never know, it\u2019s possible someone lied about this.\u201d"

Russia is to the north and the Caspian Sea is to the east.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s not what you told me.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou said it was by some place.\u201d\n \n\u201cI told you Iran, Armenia, Georgia, Turkey, Russia, and the Caspian Sea.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, you mentioned some other place. Tell the name of the place you are moving to again.\u201d\n \n\u201cAzerbaijan.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhere\u2019s Jan?\u201d\n \n\u201cWho\u2019s Jan?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou said the name of the country is Azer-By-Jan. I want to know where Jan is. I have never heard of that country.\u201d\n \nAfter some time explaining to her that countries generally do not name themselves by giving geographical indicators to other countries within their name (after all, how crazy would the United States of America by Canada and Mexico be?), she finally understood the country\u2019s name was Azerbaijan and Jan is not an actual country.\n \nSurprisingly, my father, who only made it to the 8th grade, knew so much about the country based upon watching documentaries on it. He also predicted the Russian attack on Georgia two years before it happened based up Azerbaijan bypassing Russia and using a oil pipeline through Georgia to get its oil into Europe."

I was 22, out of the army, unemployed, applied and accepted onto a college course starting in the autumn and was looking forward at a summer of boredom. I\u2019d managed to change my savings to USD with a really favorable rate so I decided to do a road trip before college started as I knew it was a last chance. Now I\u2019d attended a catholic school staffed by nuns from Missouri, so I had a pretty good command of English even it was my 3rd language. So I flew into New York, and after a week or so I decided to take a coach down to Miami with a Greyhound pass.\n \nYeah, young and stupid me, but after the army I wasn\u2019t really that picky on comforts and didn\u2019t want to blow my finances. Somewhere around the Mason-Dixon line the bus which I thought was an express coach changed into more local services, and we\u2019d change a bus every now and then and go east and west and slowly southwards. In the middle of the night we stop and this young white bloke, not much older than I was, got escorted into the bus by two sheriffs and as they politely asked was the seat free seated next to me. Being now wide awake I was a bit puzzled about my new travel companion, and he was about as puzzled about me so we ended up talking through the night, smuggling in a few beers in at the truck stops and smoking in the back under a coat as you did.\n \nNow I was an European and brought up by the nuns as \u2019colorblind\u2019 so I had never realised how divided the US society actually was along color lines. Where I was from you didn\u2019t have much ethnicities and NYC was such a shock I just rewired my brain and didn\u2019t actually realise *I* was now the minority people would stare at. Also NYC has public transport, so taking a coach\u2026 well, again I had not realised USA was a country where having a car is about as a requirement as going out with your pants on. I mean I had read about it but *realising* it was a different thing. I came with just a duffle bag and a few things as clothing was cheap in the US and I was going to update my wardrobe. So I\u2019d bought a spiffy \u201dcafe racer\u201d leather jacket in NYC\u2026 and you can guess where this leads to. A 6\u201d3 lily-white jarhead in a coach looking like\u2026 a bad undercover cop? ( I had quite a few people ask me that.) Oh, ex-military, fine ( didn\u2019t elaborate which military)\u2026 And some bemused people asking the other \u201dwhy are you speaking with *that* \u201d and ogling me with disdain. At some point and time I realised I was the only white person on the bus\u2026 until the midnight stop.\n \nSo, the only two white guys on the bus, heading down to Florida. My new mate had been paroled from prison and put on the bus to get home to the town north of Jacksonville where his family ran a sawmill. His accent was a southern drawl I had some challenges with, but he had more trouble with my accent. \nEven after I dug out my passport he couldn\u2019t fathom I was a \u201dforeigner\u201d as \u201dI was white and spoke English\u201d.\n (Thinking of this I can now understand what Americans mean by \u201dwhite privilege\u201d, though I don\u2019t think this was anything privileged.) Funny thing then for me was he was this strong as an ox farmer boy and scared shitless of all the other non-white people on the bus (he did use terms that the nuns would have stuffed a bar of soap in my mouth for). I do not know was it my naivety or arrogance or both that I had no such fear, but he basically thought of me as his bodyguard and I was thinking nobody dares give us grief if I go around with this giant. And here we get into that \u201dsouthern hospitality\u201d - we were finally changing buses in Jacksonville and I got a genuine offer, not only come visit but basically a job at the sawmill as he\u2019d learned I was unemployed and was just drifting. Being on a tourist visa or some such details weren\u2019t a problem, after all I wasn\u2019t a \u201dforeigner\u201d\u2026. when he started mentioning his sisters were single my future started sounding a bit too \u201dDeliverance\u201d so I handed my now silly drunk best buddy over to his dad who fortunately had shown up to collect the prodigal son before the local law took interest in him, and gave my best excuses I couldn\u2019t join them.\n \nI made it down the coast until Ft. Lauderdale where I thought enough is enough and jumped out and found a motel and a well-needed shower. And my learning curve continued but thats a different story. I\u2019ve thought a few times if I hadn\u2019t had that college placement and been a bit more drunk would I now be playing a banjo somewhere on the Georgia border."

She was travelling to Britain for \u2018research\u2019 and was invited\u2014no pay, but her room was free, and she could sell her books, meet the celeb guests etc. Now, when I say writer here, let it be known that although her books were professionally published, they were essentially fanfic\u2014based on a tv show and licensed as such. Not exactly deep or original stuff\u2026I\u2019d consider having my room paid for all weekend a pretty good deal tbh.\n \nAnyway, someone in our group had been penfriends with her and even met her once or twice, and we arranged a meal with about 10 people attending. When time for the meal came, Ms Primadonna had not shown up. She sent a message she was still coming. Everyone sat down, but didn\u2019t order as it would be rude if we started before she got there. Time goes by\u2026lots of time. Another message comes\u2014she has a migraine, but she\u2019s still coming. We wait. And wait. Another half hour or more goes by. We are now all starving and not sure what to do. Then ta-da, Primadonna finally swans into the room and plonks herself at the head of the table like a queen. No hello for anyone, a miserable, sour face. (OK, she had a migraine\u2014why not just cancel if she felt that bad? I am a migraineur myself\u2014doesn\u2019t turn me into a jerk.)\n \nShe grabs the menu, more facial grimaces. \u201cUgh, I don\u2019t like any of this\u2026and guess what, when I went to the drugstore they don\u2019t have the same painkillers as in America! I\u2019m not taking anything foreign! I can\u2019t believe i can\u2019t get proper drugs!\u201d\n \nSilence started to fall over the table. Her tone was petulant, unfriendly and accusatory. Being mostly Brits/Canadians and a little more reserved than she was, no one said, \u201cWhy would you think you\u2019d get the same painkillers?\u2019 although you could tell everyone was thinking it.\n \nShe continued to moan about the menu and didn\u2019t order; the rest of us finally ordered food. Primadonna didn\u2019t seem to like the fact no one was continuously fussing about her headache/lack of drugs and suddenly said, \u201cI have to go\u2019 and disappeared from the restaurant. We tried to make excuses for her because she felt unwell but\u2026\n \nShe was back at it the next day. I was going to buy her book but ahead of me, I saw a fan go up to her table, buy her stuff then ask for a photograph of her. She flung up a hand to her head in a melodramatic way like some dame in a panto. \u201cGo on but I\u2019ve had a headache\u2026\u201d she whined, all passive aggressive, making her FAN seriously uncomfortable and embarrassed.( There are nicer ways to say \u2018no\u2019, and if you are attending an event, you are in the public eye. Not one of the real celebs attending were anything like this.)\n \nLater on Primadonna cornered my friend ( the penfriend) while she was walking in the hall with me and another lady. Now came the really cringey stuff. \u201cThere\u2026there is DUST in my room,\u201d she said, almost tremulously as if about to cry. Her lower lip was so outthrust in a pout, I thought she might trip on it. \u201cI ran my finger along the ledge and saw it on my fingertip.\u201d\n \n(This was an old building, her room was free, and if there was dust in her room, it wasn\u2019t in mine or anyone else\u2019s!)\n \n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you ask housekeeping to clean it?\u201d my friend mumbled.\n \nPrimadonna rolled her eyes to heaven. \u201cThis is terrible! Dust! They can\u2019t treat me like this! They can\u2019t do this to me-I\u2019M AN AMERICAN!\u201d\n \nThere were three of us there besides Primadonna. A stunned silence fell. No one quite knew where to look after this cringe-worthy outburst.\n \nMe and one other English girl hastily made our excuses and left the hall, unable to bear it anymore. The girl looked at me once we were out of earshot and started to laugh, \u201cWhat a horrible, entitled, rude person!\u201d\n \nWe avoided Primadonna after that but heard her tell people she was a black belt in karate, which seemed pretty implausible given her rather, um, unfit physique and the fact that every ache, pain or inconvenience was a big issue.\n \nLater we heard she could not cope with the U.K. and cut her whole \u2018research\u2019 trip short and went home to the US early, losing loads of money! I guess she couldn\u2019t handle the fact no one was falling all over her, catering to every whim just because she was American and wrote some fanfics.\n \nLater the friend who\u2019d met her in the past said, \u201cI have no idea why she was freaking out about the dust. Her own house is full of brimming cigarette trays and she has about 20 cats!\u201d"

He asked how long I was staying, I said \u201ctwo weeks; the first week in said hotel and second week I\u2019ll probably hit the road and see more of the country\u201d. He asked where in the country I\u2019d go. I said I was thinking of going to southern states but hadn\u2019t set anything in stone yet.\n \nHe turned and motioned to a security guard behind him and to my surprise they led me away. It was pretty embarrassing. I remember everybody in the line behind me gawping like I was some criminal. Just to paint the scene: I\u2019m white, at the time I was in my late 20s, I had a good job, spoke well, dressed nicely, etc. I never got angry, never cussed or raised my voice.\n \nThey sat me down in a big waiting room with 10 or 20 others. I noticed the others waiting along side me could not speak English and were having problems filling in their visas.\n \nA man in a uniform (a cop? I don\u2019t know) with a handgun sat opposite me. He shouted out \u201cwhat\u2019s your occupation?\u201d. I said \u201ccomputing\u201d. In front of everybody, including 5\u201310 other cops, he shouted \u201coh\u2026 I get it\u2026 you\u2019re the type to go online on a Friday night and look for women!\u201d. I was so embarrassed! I just quietly said \u201cno\u201d. He then shouted \u201cI know\u2026 you look for a date online because you can\u2019t talk to women in person. I know what you\u2019re like. I know the sort of person you are!\u201d. I was so embarrassed about his shouting, that again, I quietly just said \u201cno\u201d.\n \nThen he turned off his computer at the switch instead of shutting it down. He said \u201cOops. Server problem. What are we going to do? Call tech support? How would you fix it? The computer\u2019s not working. How am I going to process your visa if my computer is broken? You need to fix it!\u201d. I just shrugged. I felt terrible.\n \nHe sat there in silence for a while, then called me over to his desk and wrote some notes. I sat there dry-mouthed and exhausted from my flight and his behaviour. Eventually he looked up and said \u201cok, you can go\u201d. I stood up to walk away but just couldn\u2019t. I thought there is no way I can enjoy being in this country after this experience.\n \nI desperately looked around for something to say to show I wasn\u2019t going to take all this nonsense. I saw he had a ring on his finger. Out of desperation I said \u201cwhat\u2019s that ring for?\u201d. He said \u201cI won it in the Super Bowl\u201d. I replied \u201cno you didn\u2019t, you liar. That\u2019s a class ring\u201d. He said \u201cwhat do you know about football anyway? You guys just kick that stupid little white soccer ball around\u201d. I said \u201cI know more about your football than you do\u201d. He said \u201cyeah? Let\u2019s just see about that\u201d. He hit me with a number of questions about the NFL. I answered everything with ease. He couldn\u2019t believe it! He shouted \u201coh! Check this guy out! Ask him anything about the NFL!\u201d. All his buddies crowded around the desk and I put my feet up on it LOL. They all fired questions at me and I answered everything perfectly.\n \nThe officer who had insulted me at the start shouted \u201cYou can come back any time! We\u2019ll drink some beers, we\u2019ll watch the game\u2026\u201d. Then he shouted at one of his co-workers (who was wearing a suit) \u201cgo and get this guy\u2019s bags for him!\u201d. I sat with my feet up on the desk while they ran off to collect my things from the baggage hall. I felt 10 feet tall when the guy brought my suitcase to me on one of those little trucks. At last I could enjoy my holiday! :)\n \nBut that was one bizarre experience!"

He\u2019d always say that \u201cbritain used to be ruling over so many colonies and now look\u201d or \u201cif britain ever had the chance i bet they would try and rule the world but fail. However, if america wanted to rule the world they could.\u201d Like, excuse me, i wanted to ask how your days was or hang out and have a friendly chat but no. Your bringing up past wars and trashing other countries such as germany, asian countries, the whole lot. I remember he would always say nasty things towards the french saying that they \u201csuck so bad\u201d and that \u201cbritain must suck more because they lost to france\u201d. I heard the \u2018brits are coming\u2019 repeatedly. I just wanted to have fun but clearly this guy was the sort to only value his opinion and shut out/but in everyone elses if they disagree.\n \nAt one time, we were speaking over the phone and playing games.\n \nI have never wanted to punch a prick so much. I was speaking to my younger brother whilst he started playing this loud video over the phone, i had to lower the volume considerably because it was some guy spouting nonsense about america being the greatest etc. After he realised i wasn\u2019t paying attention to the video he started playing it a second time. I ignored him again and he asked \u201cdid you hear that?\u201d and i replied \u201cno, it was too loud and i was speaking to my brother so i turned you all the way down.\u201d he got quite agitated at that. If verbally abusing other countries wasn\u2019t enough, he also started being sexist, racist and harshly talking to me about anyone who wasn\u2019t straight such as \u201cf****** lesbians\u201d as he put it. I told him to stop, i didn\u2019t like what he was saying one bit. He told me to calm down and that he was only \u2018joking\u2019. Im sorry, but everything that came out of his mouth was not funny at all. At the time i had another american friend from texas, he was a great laugh and would say offensive things but to me they were funny. He\u2019d commonly say \u2018filthy brit\u2019 and id quickly reply with \u2018filthy american\u2019. There was definately a difference between the two. Even my younger brother, who had never spoke to him (only heard him) was sick of the nasty american.\n \nIts one thing to be patriotic but to verbally abuse every other country, race or sexuality is another. I had had enough, so i stopped replying/speaking to him. I just wanted to have some fun and a nice chat, but instead i got an earful of how shit my country is as well as other countries and absolutely terrible things to do with race, gender, sex and women\n \nI felt mean ignoring him but he was not the kind of person i wanted to be friends with\u2026"

I was really excited to meet and interact (rampage) with other people from all over the world. So I got to it right away.\n \nAfter a while, I had already formed a 'crew' in the game. We had 4 Americans, an Indian and a coincidentally, a fellow Nigerian. We had a lot of fun there, driving around and chatting away. Then one day, some other American came in to talk to us. Upon reading my name tag (which also displayed the country the player is from), the first thing he said was,\n \n\u201cYou're from Nigeria?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes\u201d\n \n\u201cThat's impossible, Nigeria has no internet\u201d.\n \nI was dumbfounded. Apparently, this guy thought I was lying in the middle of the desert in \u201cAfrica\u201d, taking a well deserved break from herding the cattle, fighting Lions and what not; saying enchantments that would enable me to use the \u201cwhite man's web\u201d to connect with these other people to control my character on the magic screen in front of me. Me and my new friends tried to convince him that Nigeria, and pretty much the rest of the world did infact have internet but he still stood his ground. It turned out that this guy was a complete jackass. Soon he deemed it necessary to use the \u201cN\u201d word in every sentence he made knowing full well there were two blacks talking with him. Lucky for him I didn't feel particularly offended by the word at the time. He also made jokes about how dark I am, even though I am actually lightskinned. This guy went on to insult the Indian too, calling him \u201cterrorist\u201d and other bad \nnames\n. As if being from an Asian country that isn't China or Vietnam= Terrorist! And he actually expected the other Americans to side with him, even asking them what they were possibly doing, mingling with us 'inferiors'. Fortunately, the other people, being more sensible than him, refused and called him out on his bullshit.\n \nHe then went on to insult our countries, called us 'poor', ' hungry' and even dared me to go outside and tell a policeman I didn't believe in Allah to prove how 'free' my country was ( disregarding the fact I live in the southern and predominantly Christian part of the country). This was around the time a Nigerian man hijacked a plane in the US so for a while, Nigeria was considered an \u201canti-US\u201d country.\n \nThis went on for a while, so we had no choice but to murder the jerk and move on (video game, remember). This brief encounter led me to believe that all Americans were rude, ignorant Jacka**es and this stuck with me for a while. Although now I know that not all Americans are dumb. But the sad truth is that there are still a LOT of ignoramuses, perhaps even more than the smart ones, and this means people are more likely to meet an ignorant American. But the truth is EVERY country has dumb people, and singling out one country to pick on it is wrong. Maybe it's because USA is the current top dog. So everyone expects them to know everything about the rest of the world, like a father would.\n \nAlso I see a lot of people saying things like\n \n\u201cAmericans aren't dumb, we have GEDs!!\u201d\n \nWell, that is as relevant as saying a tiger isn't aggressive because you saw it climb a tree.\n \n\u201cDumb\u201d in this context refers to \u201cuninformed\u201d, not \u201cuneducated\u201d."

And apparently, it's this spring that that he\u2019s going to \u201csegway\u201d to YouTube. He has purposely been lying/saying these things for half a year. Only a na\u00efve fool buys hi BS and has no critical thinking ability. He hasn't gotten his diagnosis. Because I doubt takes a year for a professional to get back to you (unlikely), or something complicated is stopping the process. But he would have just mentioned that by now, right? Kyle is just lying and purposely procrastinating over something he doesn't even have. No one should treat him as half as seriously as they do to every other poor sucker who tries to boost their credibility by lying out of their asses about being \u201cdiagnosed\u201d. People who actually know themselves, don't need to wear it as a badge of honor to seek validation which subconsciously comforts their false beliefs.\n \n2.\n \nHe reinforced countless of times that ASPD+BPD males score 30+ on the PCL-R, so that he could receive validation for looking psychopathic. He's done this about 5-10 times on past accounts and wants people to think that he did. Really, if he actually did, it would have of been administrated and he wouldn\u2019t need to so desperately reinforce this. After all, he is a repeat offender who is violent, right? Liar. Hey, anyone find it strange that someone who is so \"polite\" and who admits to having empathy for cats, could smash someone's head in with a crowbar? (As he claims).\n \n3.\n \nHe cares about animal cruelty (yet literally said dogs are scared of him because he's apparently \"evil\"). He obviously loves cats plus stands up for animal cruelty. This seems like a little too much empathy for a malignant narcissist he so calls claims to be. Why does he care so much if someone trolls him with dead cats? Even if he were a malignant narcissist, one would never react the way that trolls want them to and wouldn\u2019t be affected by the trolling.\n \n4.\n \nHe literally had a pic from Wikipedia for the topic of narcissism, as his profile picture. He's just trying to appear more believable and is edgy. He also wrote this cringe ass answer regarding the history of when it was formed, it's like this image is his whole personality. Can you name one narcissist who cares about it being their image so deeply? Exactly. Edgelords have to try hard like he does.\n \n5.\n \nHe thinks that being low functioning and showing all of his true colours on Quora proves that he's credible. When in reality, he doesn't have proof of a diagnosis and therefore could be/is lying like everyone else who claims to be diagnosed. He doesn't have a diagnosis and the chance of being self-diagnosed is 50/50 like others he \"outs.\" Which means likely he is projecting about others \"self-diagnosing\" and he's probably envious they got more attention and recognition than him.\n \n6.\n \nDoes he have a cluster B disorder? Sure. Malignant narcissism? Three comorbidities of cluster B disorder plus Paranoid Personality Disorder and Sadistic personality disorder? Come on, think. Do you really think someone could have three cluster A disorders? No. Because there's too much overlap to make n accurate diagnosis. It's extremely unlikely anyone could actually have three cluster b disorders. There are too many similarities and overlap to be able to distinguish someone having three. It\u2019s only possible to have two with overlapping traits.\n \n7.\n \nHe lies out of his ass. He obviously tries to buff himself up and look smarter than what he is by gaslighting his viewers into feeling they are dumb, by using big words he puts into wrong contexts/doesn\u2019t know what they actually mean. His writing is sloppy and of a pseudo-intellectual. Honestly, he said he was going to get a PhD in history (obvious BS). Says he\u2019s gonna get a diagnosis. Says he\u2019s a malignant narcissist when he loves cats and has empathy for animals (too much for my liking). Says he was \"evil\" when he likes domesticated animals. Says he has paranoia when he was easily manipulated/lied to by a stranger on YouTube. Also, he says he was \u201cbanned\u201d to look \u201ccool\u201d or \u201cantisocial\u201d when he has deleted his past accounts many times due to inadequacy and depression. You will find none of his old followers following any band accounts and the likelihood of them all unfollowing his past \u201cbanned\u201d accounts is unlikely.\n \nHe\u2019s a lying edgelord who projects that others are edgelords. Do us a favour, stop embarrassing yourself and delete your account.\n \nOh and Kyle, you\u2019re not handsome. You're an over grown dork who's fucking ugly as Satan's ingrown toe nail."

It was the regular stay for a lot of civilian contractors for a US base close by. All except one, were truly good folks. We could laugh, joke and drink together in the bar and it was a warm ex-pat feel. The new guy decided to drop his limited overseas understanding out to the barmaid. Dotty knows my wife and kids and has given them loads of tips for stuff to do when I couldn\u2019t get away from the office. The guy was a smoking hole after Dotty planted him with a tirade on things like pointing up the road, \u201cyou find me one American grave there, you won\u2019t, and I can show you Canadians and British\u201d. His colleagues were truly embarrassed for unleashing this prick on the locals without a briefing. I got a memory of the other folks having a laugh at dickhead\u2019s expense and leaving Dotty a tip and an apology. One guy in the whole crowd was an ignorant American, the rest were simply a great bunch of folks.\n \nWhat do you mean you don\u2019t want my money?\n \nThis was a whiney east coaster in a cigar shop in Edinburgh. I\u2019m perusing a couple of Cubans and this c#ck pushes ahead of me to the counter as his son wants a cigar and NOW. A middle aged guy in a nice suit was stood by the door. Whiney starts to bitch, moan and make squeaky noises at the counter staff and me. He would not shut up and was making a scene, but no-one really cared. All I wanted was to choose a selection, get it boxed, pay and leave. Whiney has to interrupt me every time I opened my mouth, even thought the rude little turd had shoved his way in. I get bored of bad manners very quickly. Turned to his attendant in the suit, \u201cBodyguard, minder, that kind of thing?\u201d, Whiney was not engaged, just ranting at the counter folks and suit said with a gentle smile, \u201cjust the driver that the hotel provides\u201d. \u201cExcellent, could you tell your cargo that an apology or his teeth are the next things out his mouth?\u201d. Whiney, simply did the third option and fucked off. I\u2019m not saying that he got lot labelled as ignorant was because he was American, but because he was American and made a complete twat out of himself.\n \nSummary\n \nOut of the many folks I have met from the USA, I can only point to those two pricks above as outliers. There are others, but they would be dickheads anywhere on the planet."

I explain that yes you can open a bank account without being a US citizen and I do have a US SSN, see, this is my US SS Card. \u201cOh, so you\u2019re American! Then I need your American ID!\u201d No, I\u2019m not American, you don\u2019t need to be American to get an SSN.\n \nWe went round four or five times until I was finally able to get her to accept a dare: \u201clisten, just type this SSN into your computer and see what it spits up, ok?\u201d\n \nShe looked at me like she really wished she had glasses so she could glare over them and typed.\n \nLo and behold, the computer spit out\u2026 my name, SSN, an old account from that bank (now closed) and an address which happened to match my (expired therefore not valid) Florida driver\u2019s license!\n \nShe and the branch manager also claimed that it was not possible to transfer money electronically from Spain and that the account didn\u2019t have an IBAN (International Bank Account Number).

Before this one kid got there, nobody ever said \u201cthe n-word\u201d mainly because there was absolutely no occasion for it. Anyway, we\u2019re in Social Studies class, and this kid was apparently idly perusing the world map in the textbook, maybe the first time in his life he\u2019d seen such a map, when he discovered the African nation of Niger. So of course, apropos of nothing, in the middle of class, this kid bursts out yelling \u201cNi99ER!!\u201d Not once but several times.

The teacher explained that it was pronounced as Niger, not \u201cNigger\u201d and tried to explain something about the root of the word\u2026 The kid laughed, and cackled, and from that day forward referred to black people as \u201cNigers\u201d and cackled hysterically about it. For a couple years, until we graduated, it seemed like that kid\u2019s main interest in life was ridiculing the fact that a nation called Niger existed, and conflating that with the \u2018n-word\u2019 in every way possible. Oh, and for some weird reason, that kid always shouted and repeated the word \u201cFlagstaff\u201d whenever he heard it said by anyone else, in any context. He seemed to find the word \u2018Flagstaff\u2019 inherently hysterical, and after compulsively repeating it, he\u2019d sit there and chuckle, shake his head, and marvel at the existence of such a place name for quite a while. \u201cFLAGSTAFF!!! Harharhar\u201d. Every. Single. Time. Niger and Flagstaff, endless amusement. That kid laughed constantly, mainly about those two things, demonstrating that ignorance really is bliss.\n \nOh, I just remembered another incident with that kid. In shop class, he was watching this other kid rip a 2x4 in half on the huge table saw. It was a long 2x4, ten feet or so, and when the kid finished the cut, the cutoff piece got trapped between the fence and blade, and that was a huge, powerful, industrial saw. It launched that 2x2 off the saw _hard_ and fast. I was standing there watching everything, off to the side. There were really grisly photos on the walls of that shop class of the possible injuries we could inflict on ourselves (or indeed on others) with the tools in the shop, and I took heed, was cautious and safety-oriented, and thankfully avoided injury. Our Southern friend, not so much. He had a cavalier attitude toward safety, and in this instance stood directly in line with the blade, and with the wood, so as to better observe the cut the other kid was making. Southern boy had his thumbs hooked in his belt, or his pockets, or something, elbows out, feet wide apart, when the lumber got launched off the saw, and it hit him right in the pubic bone. He went flying backward, crumpled over, folded in half, and hit a metal electrical box behind him so hard he dented it in, then collapsed. He was okay. I saw him in the shower later, and he had a square bruise where it hit him, bloody, green, purple\u2026. It hit him really, really hard. It if would have been a couple inches lower, something awful would have happened, but it looked like it nearly broke his pubic bone. He said it was very painful. I made a mental note to keep staying out of the way of any possible launched hazards, and I\u2019ve tried to live by that. Hopefully that kid learned some lessons, too. Though I kinda doubt it.\n \nThen, later in life, I actually spent some time in the Deep South, Georgia among other places. I worked for a plumber, so I was a plumber\u2019s helper, technically. I\u2019ve never seen anything like that. The guy I was working for was the most rabidly racist caricature of a Southerner imaginable. Literally every time we saw a black person while driving around, he\u2019d have to call them an n-word. Since there were hundreds of black people about in Georgia, the guy spent about half his verbal output going niggerniggerniggernigger\u2026. It was ridiculous. And every single time he saw a woman, any woman, he would say \u201cI\u2019d _FUCK_ her!\u201d like a robot, every time.\n \nBut when he wasn\u2019t being horribly racist or sexist, he was usually moaning in pain and begging for death. He took pills during the day, alarmingly often, for gastric distress. He moaned and clutched his belly \u201cOh Gawd damn it hurts! Ah wanna die it hurts so bad! Gawddamn pills ain\u2019t no help neither!\u201d After a couple days of this..."

I looked at her in disbelief. \"Uhh.. just like any other city?\u201d I didn't say much as I thought it might be futile explaining I live in a really safe city with high quality of life if they happened to have preconceived opinions about immigrants or border towns.\n \nAfter a little awkward silence I said \"I come here with my husband, he's from Netherlands, this is our first time in a European cruise\" then my husband arrives almost on cue and sits down with his plate. They take a look at him with their eyes about to pop out and say \"I was expecting him to be blonde!\" One says shocked. (My husband is more Mediterranean looking -brunette, dark eyes, olive skin, a thick beard). At this point they just start talking to my husband and they mentioned they have visited his country: \"Amsterdam and Copenhagen\" and I tried not to burst into laughter as my husband explains Copenhagen is in Denmark not Netherlands (and how can you not know this when you visited the freaking country?).\n \nThen my brother comes and sits with us (he looks really White) and they look at him confused and ask me, \"which one is your husband again?\" (I'm guessing in their brain they saw a White man and thought, Oh, he HAS to be the Dutch guy, not this Mediterranean-looking one we were just talking to that says he's from Netherlands! This SURELY has to be a mistake or something!!). \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n \nThey were speaking pretty loudly too and I'm sure all the nearby tables were listening and I was just so embarrassed and disappointed and we just left and wished them a safe trip."

He just couldn't not smoke weed. Still probably made around 20 million dollars but he was one of the best but got suspended five times missed probably three seasons and basically got the boot from the NFL because of that. I know nowadays it's not a big deal but when he was playing it certainly was, either way it cost him a hundred million just because he needed weed. There are plenty of other dumbbells out there, I just haven't met them like George W Bush and Johnny Manziel another football player who had the world at his fingertips but wanted to be a drunk and couldn't keep out of trouble and threw it all away.

Now, not all disabilities are visible, but this family didn't appear to have any ailments - except perhaps restricted thinking. The Tower of London was started in the year 1066 on the base of an even more ancient Roman Fort. Being a Royal Fortress it was designed to be - well - a Fortress!

While it is difficult to pinpoint a single person as the \u201cmost ignorant\u201d American I have ever met, I can recount an interesting encounter that shed light on the importance of education and open-mindedness.\nA few years ago, I had the opportunity to engage in a conversation with an individual during a social gathering. Let\u2019s call him John. John was a middle-aged man who held strong opinions about various topics, particularly politics and world affairs. As our conversation progressed, it became evident that John had limited exposure to diverse viewpoints and relied heavily on sensationalized media sources for information.\n \nOne topic that stood out during our discussion was climate change. John firmly believed that climate change was a hoax, dismissing the overwhelming scientific consensus and evidence supporting its existence. His arguments were based on misconceptions and misinformation propagated by climate change skeptics. Despite attempts to present factual data and studies, John remained resistant to accepting any alternative perspective.\n \nWhat struck me about this encounter was not just John\u2019s skepticism but his unwillingness to critically evaluate new information. It highlighted the importance of intellectual curiosity and the ability to challenge one\u2019s own beliefs. In a rapidly changing world where information is easily accessible, it is crucial to remain open-minded and consider multiple perspectives.\n \nIgnorance, in this context, can be seen as the lack of exposure to accurate and reliable information. ignorance is not necessarily a permanent state but rather a condition that can be overcome through education and a willingness to learn. Encountering individuals like John serves as a reminder of the significance of promoting critical thinking and fostering a culture of lifelong learning.\n \nWhile John may have exemplified ignorance on the topic of climate change, it is essential to approach such encounters with empathy and understanding. Instead of labeling someone as the \u201cmost ignorant,\u201d it is more constructive to recognize the gaps in knowledge and engage in meaningful conversations that encourage learning and growth."

Among the rides and other attractions, there was a small path leading down to a sort of \u201ccattle shed\u201d. And in the shed was a full sized triceratops animatronic figure. In those days these robotic figures were nowhere near as common as today, but it was obvious that its movement, though clever, was controlled by some guy hiding behind a screen, moving the beast according to what was happening.\n \nThe two keepers gave us their spiel about how \u201cGladys\u201d (or whatever her name was, I forget now) was three years old, very tame and so on, inviting kids to stroke its nose (at which it \u201cpurred\u201d). They also took its temperature rectally (something it didn't like) and the triceratops groaned and shook it's head in disgust. After that, they told us they had to take a urine sample, and so one of the keepers placed a bucket underneath but the triceratops wouldn't perform. So the other keeper stooped under to see what was wrong, and immediately the guy behind the screen caused the triceratops to let loose a load of water over the keeper, much to the audience\u2019s delight. Everyone roared with laughter.\n \nThis was going on for about 15 minutes. Suddenly, in a loud, serious voice behind us, a huge Texan, complete with the classic drawl, turned to his friend and said:\n \n\u201cHey, Burt, That's not a \nREAL\n Dah-no-sawr!\n \n\u201cThere\u2019s NO way that's real\u201d.\n \n\u201cAhh paid fifty bucks to come here an\u2019 Ahh thought Ahh was gonna see a REAL Dah-no-sawr.\u201d\n \n\u201cThere's NO Way that's real\u201d.\n \nI wonder if he managed to get his money back?"

We had some common friends in California, a Belgian painter and her partner working for the Department of Justice. Both of our guests held senior positions.

My father advised them to continue their tour back to Belgium and visit Bastogne, where they\u2019d have the opportunity to visit a museum dedicated to the \u201cBattle of the Bulge\u201d. (as the battle for Bastogne is usually known in the US). He even insisted given that distances are way shorter in Europe they could spend the day over there and come back for dinner in Brussels, stay overnight, and catch their plane the day after!\n \nAt that point, they were both intrigued. The lady asked about how the actual \u201cshort distance was\u201d, and her husband wondered how far Germany was exactly. My father blushed a bit and tried to explain that Bastogne was a Belgian town that American soldiers held against overwhelming Nazi forces until Monty turned up, and the skies cleared in 1944. All that sounded like well-learned school lessons, but he was stunned when he heard the American gentleman remark: Do you really mean that Belgium was occupied by Germany during the Second World War?!\n \nMy father remained voiceless.

I don't know, I guess I should copyright it, maybe I have copyrighted it.\"\n \nMyFox New York, March 2015\n \n(\"Let's Make America Great Again\" was one of Ronald Reagan's most well-known campaign slogans)\nAnd then there a couple oldies but goodies\u2026\nLook, having nuclear \u2014 my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart \u2014 you know, if you\u2019re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I'm one of the smartest people anywhere in the world \u2014 it\u2019s true! \u2014 but when you're a conservative Republican they try \u2014 oh, do they do a number \u2014 that\u2019s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune \u2014 you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we\u2019re a little disadvantaged \u2014 but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me \u2014 it would have been so easy, and it\u2019s not as important as these lives are \u2014 nuclear is so powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what's going to happen and he was right, who would have thought? \u2014 but when you look at what's going on with the four prisoners \u2014 now it used to be three, now it\u2019s four \u2014 but when it was three and even now, I would have said it's all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don't, they haven\u2019t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it\u2019s gonna take them about another 150 years \u2014 but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us, this is horrible.\"\nI'm not even sure exactly what the point of this one was supposed to be. ..\nYou remember Hillary with the coal, right, sitting with the miners at the table? Remember? That wasn\u2019t so good for her. So the people of West Virginia and all over, you look at Wyoming, you look at so many different places where they just, Pennsylvania, where they loved what we did, and it\u2019s clean coal and we have the most modern procedures. But it\u2019s a tremendous form of energy in the sense that in a military way \u2014 think of it \u2014 coal is indestructible.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou can blow up a pipeline, you can blow up the windmills. You know, the windmills, boom, boom, boom [mimicking windmill sound] bing [mimes shooting large gun], that\u2019s the end of that one. If the birds don\u2019t kill it first. The birds could kill it first. They kill so many birds. You look underneath some of those windmills, it\u2019s like a killing field, the birds. But you know, that\u2019s what they were going to, they were going to windmills. And you know, don\u2019t worry about \u2014 when the wind doesn\u2019t blow, I said, \u2018What happens when the wind doesn\u2019t blow?\u2019 \u2018Well, then we have a problem.\u2019\n \n\u201cOkay, good. They were putting them in areas where they didn\u2019t have much wind, too. And it\u2019s a subs \u2014 you need subsidy for windmills. You need subsidy. Who wants to have energy where you need subsidy? So, uh, the coal is doing great.\u201d\nAnd these 3 are just the low hanging fruit.

The undersea megathrust earthquake , known by the scientific community as the Sumatra\u2013Andaman earthquake , [ 8 ] [ 9 ] was caused by a rupture along the fault between the Burma plate and the Indian plate , and reached a Mercalli intensity of IX in some areas. A massive tsunami with waves up to 30\u00a0m (100\u00a0ft) high, known as the Boxing Day Tsunami after the Boxing Day holiday, or as the Asian Tsunami , [ 10 ] devastated communities along the surrounding coasts of the Indian Ocean, killing an estimated 227,898 people in 14 countries, violently in Aceh ( Indonesia ), and severely in Sri Lanka , Tamil Nadu ( India ), and Khao Lak ( Thailand ). The direct results caused major disruptions to living conditions and commerce in coastal provinces of surrounded countries. It is the deadliest natural disaster of the 21st century , [ 11 ] one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history , and the worst tsunami disaster in history.

The undersea megathrust earthquake , known by the scientific community as the Sumatra\u2013Andaman earthquake , [ 8 ] [ 9 ] was caused by a rupture along the fault between the Burma plate and the Indian plate , and reached a Mercalli intensity of IX in some areas. A massive tsunami with waves up to 30\u00a0m (100\u00a0ft) high, known as the Boxing Day Tsunami after the Boxing Day holiday, or as the Asian Tsunami , [ 10 ] devastated communities along the surrounding coasts of the Indian Ocean, killing an estimated 227,898 people in 14 countries, violently in Aceh ( Indonesia ), and severely in Sri Lanka , Tamil Nadu ( India ), and Khao Lak ( Thailand ). The direct results caused major disruptions to living conditions and commerce in coastal provinces of surrounded countries. It is the deadliest natural disaster of the 21st century , [ 11 ] one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history , and the worst tsunami disaster in history. [ 12 ] It is also the worst natural disaster in the history of Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

I cannot even count the number of waitresses who told us that they speak fluent Spanish if case we prefer.\n \nNow, personally, I did not mind, it was clear that the waitresses were simply trying to be friendly and helpful to customers, and besides, I do speak fluent Spanish as well, and I saw it as an invitation to practice it (and it came handy that one time in Orlando where I met a vendor from Venezuela who really spoke only Spanish). But I kept thinking, and still think to this day: If you are as fluent in Spanish as you claim, can\u2019t you recognize that the language we are speaking is not even remotely similar to Spanish?\n \nEDIT: Exceedingly stupid comments trying to argue with me about my own experience or proficiency in English, or just comments trying to push baseless speculations are going to be deleted. I really have neither the time nor patience for this."

I would have added in that the Southern Baptist Convention is the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination (even though half of them never show up for church) and it split with mainline Baptists in the 1800s because they wanted missionaries to be able to own slaves. They openly say this in their seminaries when men interested in becoming pastors (it\u2019s never a woman) study the history of the denomination\u2014which I can respect them for admitting. But these are the people who want to determine how teachers address slavery. If you can watch \u201cAmistad\u201d and still argue black people were better off under slavery and not understand why they fought back and why America erupted into a civil war over the issue, then you are the most ignorant American I have ever met, and a horrible human being."

I\u2019ve never seen so many pine trees in all my life, rolling endlessly like waves on the ocean across barren mountains.\n \nI was camping near Golden in the summer months, staying at a campsite with a few other travellers. This was when I used to do hitchhiking up the Trans-Canada Highway.\nIn this campsite were a variety of different travellers from across the world. Some were Canadian, a few Australians, there was a German, Spaniard and a couple of Americans.\n \nWe were isolated. Our campsite was deep in the mountains. I saw black bears and all sorts of other mammals. Everyone was naturally curious about black bears, afraid of being mauled to death but also very eager to get a photograph of them.\n \nI remember prepping for hours about how I would react in case a bear approached me, looking for its next meal. I knew how to roll on the ground, stand tall and shout, pop off a firecracker and I read up on how to use bear spray if it came to it.\nNow enters one of the most idiotic individuals I have ever met.\n \nLet\u2019s call him Captain Know-it-All.\nCaptain Know-it-All had lectured us for the last two nights around the campfire about how he was a \u2018citizen of the world\u2019 (whatever that means) in one of the thickest Californian accents I\u2019ve encountered. He also told us about the wilderness as if he were a pioneer explorer.\n \nCaptain Know-it-All seemed to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of the outdoors, especially wilderness survival. Yet he was very gaunt and seemed to have only left his daily outing to the coffee shop for the first time on this trip. He was very slim, lanky, tall like a giraffe with long hair and a drawn out face.\n \nWe were all developing headaches as he tried to impress us. His Romanian girlfriend only encouraged him on, inflating his ego to mountainous proportions.\nAround his waist at all times was a tool belt containing every piece of kit you can think, including a small hatchet that was impossible to cut anything with and a strange admixture of blunt instruments except for a sharp hunter\u2019s knife which was far too dangerous for this person to carry.\n \nHe also had fire starters dangling from the belt, a compass in case he strayed ten metres from his car, and all manners of other rubbish he was never going to use. The only thing this absurd tool belt was going to do was weigh him down when a bear\u2019s stomach grumbled. However, out of all these tools, Captain Know-it-All\u2019s most prized possession was a canister of bear-spray.\nI was actually told by an expert wilderness survivalist who lived alone in the Canadian mountains to not carry bear spray with me when hiking. I thought this was counterintuitive, but he explained that many of the people who try to use it have absolutely no idea how to safely discharge a canister.\n \nProblems include not only being unable to aim at a fast moving bear charging towards you, but missing the target, not opening it fast enough or misjudging wind direction. You can\u2019t just fire glorified pepper spray into strong winds and \nnot\n be throughly coated in eye-burning liquids. This expert judged that those with little experience are more likely to hurt themselves with bear spray than have any successful chance of hurting the bear.\n \nThe best tips for a black bear encounter are not to run away, but to make yourself big by waving both arms and creating loud noises. This will scare off black bears most of the time rather than blinding yourself with bear spray and potentially aggravating a black bear with the spray.\nNow back to Captain Know-it-All.\n \nThis \u2018citizen of the world\u2019 (who was very eager to apologise for being American) was packing his belongings for a day of hiking with his Romanian girlfriend. In the boot of their car, they were arranging everything for the hike as if they were trekking to the Grand Canyon and back.\n \nOf course, as they both fiddled with the bear spray, they somehow managed to spray each other in the face and eyes whilst knee deep in the boot of their car.\nSafe to say, they didn\u2019t go hiking that day."

Best story to tell though honestly although if I were him I would be extremely embarrassed and either a) get a brain WITH brain cells or b) go to specsavers."

They had to fly business class since it would have been physically impossible for them to sit in an Economy class seat!\n \nThey were so large that they both needed extender seat belts, the first and only time I have ever seen these being used. And that's when it started. The husband declared at the top of his voice, \u201cI\u2019m an American, I\u2019m from Texas, I don't need a seat belt.\u201d The crew tried to explain to them that it was the law, and eventually, they calmed down and put them on\u2014I think they had had a few drinks in the lounge beforehand.\n \nWe eventually took off, and the meal service came. They couldn't use the fold tables since their stomachs were in the way (also a first for me to see). Special trays had to be used, which they perched on their stomachs (gee, I wish phones had cameras back then!).\n \nAnyway, they proceeded to drink more and more, and their voices became louder and louder. Every once in a while, if they didn't like something, they would say \u201cI'm an American,\u201d and bearing in mind, this was Jan 2002, just four months after 9/11, they would also say things like, \u201cAmerica is going to kick some Taliban arse!\u201d. I am sure you all get the picture.\n \nEveryone else in the cabin was just rolling their eyes and laughing at them - I said to one of the flight attendants, \u201cAny chance you could open the side door and kick them out?\u201d She just laughed and said, \u201cI wish\u201d! We were at 30,000 feet over the Pacific at the time!\n \nI have been to the US more times than I can count, and I have never ever met anyone who comes close to these two thoroughly obnoxious/ignorant people!"

I\u2019m from Chicago and we occasionally get beavers chewing down trees on private property near rivers. The authorities usually quietly remove the trouble makers. People without river front property get upset if the beavers are killed openly. Any how it really rained one night and the radio said a major highway was closed because a beaver dam broke. The detour was over a hundred miles. I laughed out loud when I heard this. It seemed absurd. Our fishing resort owners considered the incident as normal. Shootings take place every day in certain neighborhoods in Chicago and although it isn\u2019t normal or Ok it is routine. Travel the world and learn amazing stuff. I don\u2019t know what happened to the Canadian beavers. It took a week or so before the road was reopened."

The fnance manager replied, \u201cCanada, is that in Colorado?\u201d and the bank employee asked if Canada was in Ohio. HELLO\n \nI had to patiently and diplomatically explain to them both that we were from Canada, the big *country* north of the US, while picking my jaw up off the ground at their stunning ignorance. Do US public schools not teach even a bare-bones-level of geography? How can any American NOT KNOW the countries immediately north and south of its borders, or even that there\u2019s a country called Canada??\n \nOne more example of an ignorant American is really reflective of her *parents*, not her, because it was a minor child. My college bordered a busy residential side street that led to a student parking lot in the back and one day one my way to class, driving down the side street an 8\u201310-week-old puppy ran out from the driveway of a house toward my car. Being an animal-lover I pulled right over, jumped out, grabbed the puppy off the road, and carried her up the driveway where some children were playing. I returned their puppy and asked why they let her run loose into traffic. The oldest child, about 8 or 9 years old, said, \u201cMy mama says if that puppy don\u2019t know enough to stay off the road it deserves to get hit.\u201d\n \nInwardly I felt horrified at hearing such an ignorant, heartless thing, especially from a child. But instead of scolding the little girl who, judging from her house and neighborhood, was from a low-income, likely under-educated family, I crouched down and petted her puppy and said, \u201cDo you remember when you were just a wee baby? Remember how when we were really little we didn\u2019t know very much and had to have lots of time to learn stuff?\u201d She nodded. \u201cWell,\u201d I continued, \u201cyour puppy is just a baby dog and she doesn\u2019t know anything yet, either. She\u2019s relying on you to teach her to stay off the road so she doesn\u2019t get run over. Just like your mama probably taught you not to run into the road, right?\u201d\n \nShe nodded again, yes. I told her she had a precious life in her hands, that her puppy also needed to be taught, and protected, like her mama had taught her, and if she took care that her puppy never ran into the road again that puppy would live and be her best friend. She smiled and I said goodbye and headed to class.\n \nI think and hope my message got through to that young girl and her siblings, and their ignorance wasn\u2019t their fault\u2014it was clear her mama either didn\u2019t grasp, or care, that puppies need to be trained and confined to their own properties, and they deserve to be properly cared for and protected. That experience gave me a glimpse (one of many, especially in the US South) of generational ignorance that\u2019s passed on between parents and children."

I came to this site, for intelligent debate, humour and to improve my knowledge.\n \nI am already heartily sickened by this question, I seem to get it in my \u201cfeed\u201d virtually daily. I admit that in the early days, I occasionally rose to the bait, when irritated by similarly, derogative, pejorative questions and posts denigrating Britain and the British.\n \nThere are ignorant people in every country, including Britain. My next statement re Brexit, will no doubt result in outrage amongst Brexiteers and I shall be subjected to vitriolic , venomous abuse. However, in my opinion, many who voted to leave, must have been ignorant of the benefits of being in the EU, and the ramifications of leaving and did nothing to inform themselves prior to making such an important decision. A far more important decision than electing a President, they only last 4 years. Brexit is probably forever. A prime example of a large percentage of British voters displaying ignorance.\n \nI have never been to the US and have no desire to, I have no American connections or friends, I have no vested interest. However there is already too much anger and enmity in todays world. I do not know in whose interests it is to sow discord between us, Quora ,to drive traffic, trolls who feed on anger or even more sinister, other nations who have a vested interest in creating disunity between NATO countries. Unless we are really lucky, I think we are on the verge of WWIII, I hope and pray I am mistaken, but we need to stand shoulder to shoulder, now more than ever.\n \nFinally, I have been moved by the plight of those, right thinking Americans, who are horrified and embarrassed by the election of Trump. I know I am\u201d old school\u201d, arguably just old, and the values I adhere to are probably not held by many anymore, but as Brits we always fought for the \u201cunderdog\u201d and were taught one should not \u201c kick a man when they are down\u201d. This is not to imply any feelings of superiority over the US, but simply to reflect that many of the American Quorans need to be shown some empathy and understanding.\n \nNo doubt I will now also be subjected to abuse by Trump supporters as well as Brexiteers. If I were smart, I would disable comments, but I\u2019m not going to, well not yet!\n \nI am readying myself for the onslaught of hate."
