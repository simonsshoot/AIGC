A high percentage of Nigerians can't afford this but others can easily. Our problems are deeply rooted in our corrupt system from government down to an individual level. We presently have an incompetent and corrupt government that has made the lives of the average Nigerian difficult. We are going to be better someday when we get it right but until then, Nigeria is a poor country of which we aren't proud of the situation but we are working to make sure we are respected and admired worldwide as a nation worthy of emulation."

And we are economically poor but mentally rich.\n \nI will try to keep it short. I am sharing my story here because I believe it will motivate many depressed souls struggling in life. I didn't know about this platform until yesterday when my colleague told me about it. Thanks to him.\nSo, my name is Aniket Bharadwaj. I have been brought up in Wardha, Maharashtra and belong to a poor family (not BPL though). Basically, my dad is a farmer. We don't own any land and therefore, my dad works on big farmers and landlords\u2019 field as a laborer. We used to own some land in the countryside Wardha but we had to sell every inch of our land as my dad was indebted by my grandfather who was cheated by moneylenders .\n \nMy dad is illiterate and he knows the importance of education. He never let my studies get hampered. One time meal could be sacrificed but not my education.\n \nI attended village primary school which was 8 km away and we ( my younger sister ) had to walk up and down. I remember how my dad used to motivate me during my Maharashtra board papers.\n \nI have also seen days when we had to sleep empty stomach. Due to bad pricing of sugar in market or a bad produce, there were days on which we had nothing to eat.\n \nI specifically remember one day , on which my father was abused by moneylender as he wanted money to finance my education but they said ,\n \u201ceducation is unnecessary. Take your son to field with you and repay our loan ASAP\".\n \nBut, since my father knew the importance of education, and hence he took loan of double interest , and \nsince then I never looked back\n.\nI am indebted to my father for making me realise importance of education and he stressed that education is the only thing which can change our family's condition and take us out of misery. Finally, today, I can proudly say that we are in a much better condition. I studied at a good University in Pune. Thanks for my school headmaster's son for helping me. He was sent by God, literally! Such souls still exist on this cruel planet.\n \nI have given almost every exam and cleared them but sadly, neither my dad nor my friends could support me more. I couldn't go to Kota for JEE preparations. But I had decided that\n I will, someday, join some premier institute as a faculty to help out poor students (economically) like me. \nAnd I started earning at a coaching from last month.\n \nI am still economically poor but I believe in myself. I believe God is not that merciless. I have seen my Dad struggle and I promised him that he doesn't have to work anymore. I will pay back all the loans and shut the mouth of money lenders.\nI would like to share some pics of my village with you:\n \nMy Dad working \u2764\ufe0f\nMy eldest brother. Yeah, he is quite older than me.\n \n \n \n \nMy 5 star room :)\nMy dad threw a party. Yes, after many days, we got a reason to celebrate.\nOur house is not so big. This scene is from a neighbor's veranda.\nMy library where I used to study as there was no light or fan in my house. Took this pic with my new phone. Bought a second hand Redmi. This pic makes me feel rich. Never thought I would own such mobile phone. Love you father. Had he pushed me into farming, I won't be writing answer on this site today.\nMy old phone.\nThese are my nephews. I gifted them these clothes from my first salary.\n \nThis is my favorite spot. I used to come here with my village head's cattles. Thankfully, I don't have to do this anymore. But it was an exciting thing.\nI hope this answer motivates you. And I am here to help you all."

Today there are millions of helping tools and everyone is empowered to create a blog. The only question that is still hovering in the air is - \nhow to start a successful blog?\n \nSo let\u2019s go - here are some tips for those who are just starting and even for those who already have a blog:\nChoose your blog niche.\n It\u2019s easy to start a blog if you already know what you want to talk about but even if you don\u2019t have your own topic, don\u2019t give up - there are numerous bloggers who started with one idea and ended up with the other one. \nYou are creating a company or have a product? Writing a blog about it could become a great marketing strategy that would drag more attention to your business.\nHave something for the start.\n A lot of people start a blog without even knowing what to write about, it\u2019s not the end of the world but surely you can do better! \nBefore starting a blog, gather up some materials around you that can be used in the blog - photos, some thoughts written down. Having something for the start obligates you to create a blog and not procrastinate with only thought about having it.\nSelect an interesting domain name.\n Forget all the boring ones and find a name that stands out. There are some interesting TLDs for your domain, you don\u2019t have to use .com, with imagination you can make even .online TLD attractive!\nAlso, these tips can help to select the best domain name for you: \nMake the domain memorable\n - keep it short and simple, you can use domain checkers to help you find the one that fits you best!\n \nKnow your audience\n - domain target keywords are really important to your audience so make it relevant.\n \nLess but better\n - avoid any hyphens, numbers or non-unicode characters in the domain name. It could be too difficult to remember or hard to understand.\n \nCheck for popular keywords\n - with the domain checker you can find domains with popular keywords. Also, it can help you find domains with the same name and variations, buying those can help you to protect your brand.\n \nProtect your privacy\n - make sure that privacy protection is activated for your domain name. This will hide your private data from the WHOIS database.\n \nBe fast to be first\n - hurry up as the domain you want can be bought within seconds!\nAnalyze the blogs you like.\n It is so much easier to start with an example. I am not talking about copying others, just getting some inspiration and finding successful methods. Don\u2019t forget to analyze which blogs are getting the most traffic - SimilarWeb can help you out with that. If a blog is getting a lot of traffic, research what could be the key factors of that. \nYou can even analyze the SEO strategy of other websites! \nNeil Patel\n allows you to do that through his own website.\nRemember that SEO is important but Content is still the king.\n No one ever got traffic without doing anything BUT it doesn\u2019t mean that expensive ads will give you what you want. The most important thing here is content and you need to \nmake sure it\u2019s rock-solid\n, though \nSEO\n is also playing a huge role in blogging.\nSet up social media platforms.\n Online presence is important and using social media can help you increase your user engagement. It\u2019s the best tool to notify people about new articles and plans. Facebook and Instagram can help you grow and receive feedback from your readers directly. Also, you can implement the links from your blog post to Facebook and Instagram to gain more followers there and create a community for them. \nAs social media channels (and even effective ones) the personal profiles can be used too. A lot of bloggers have their blogs linked in the \u201cAbout me\u201d section of their Facebook and Instagram profiles. Self-promotion for friends and followers can increase traffic and popularity.\nCreate a top-notch design.\n Even when content is so important, you have to make sure that your visitors can easily read it and find it. The eye-catching design is a must to keep the readers in the blog for more than a few seconds. You can create a design yourself, or you can use existing templates - WordPress has a lot of them! If you have no idea about the latest trends, give a shot for a minimalistic look. It will make your blog look more professional and easy to navigate.\nCongrats! Now your blog is ready to storm the internet. Be sure to keep it updated and it will stay on the successful path. Here Google Analytics and other platforms that help to track your blog growth or plan its future will come in handy. \nA goal without a plan is just a wish, so make it real and enjoy the journey!"

Here\u2019s the actual answer below.\nWell, all those things which I have, were actually bought by my father during the period when he was earning decently \naround 25k per month\n in a good marketing company with his genuine efforts during years \n2010\u20132015\n (except house). He was working there since 2003, but earned less than that earlier.\n \nLater, there were issues with the company and my father switched to another company and there was a\n sudden and extreme downfall in the income source\n. Note that though he is intelligent and hard-working, he is \nnot even a 12th-pass student.\n Yet he is \nthe only earning member\n in our house!\n \nOur present home was owned by my grandfather and father \nback in 90s\n when they came to Mumbai first. It\u2019s rate was somewhere around \n50k\n those days.\n \nThe first 5 electronic gadgets we own (as listed above) were all bought during those 5 years (2010\u20132015)\n as there was \na technical aspirant growing up in the house\n and hence it became a necessity. We had a marginal budget though to buy those gadgets with our good savings back then. \nHence, the better of the cheapest gadgets!\n \nSome of you might ask how I afforded to study Engineering in a private college like \nVidyalankar Institute of Technology\n. It\u2019s simple! \nWhen your father recognizes your dedication and hard work, he makes sure he earns and save that much! \nHe\u2019s called father for a reason!\n \nAnyway I got \n40% of fees (about \u20b945k) waived off\n, thanks to my caste. \n(That gratitude was only for assisting my hard work and situation, not otherwise!)\n.\n \nI still use the \nsame phone\n as it shows no signs of getting old even after \n7 years\n and I deal only with my phone calls and messages through it. I still use the \nsame laptop\n even though \nits battery and hinges are damaged\n as I get to connect to the Internet through it. Don\u2019t get surprised! I have a mere\n 600kbps local internet pack\n which is enough to play a YouTube video without getting buffered.\n \nMy father being newly joined to the company now, earns very less than former company but enough to pay at least the important and only bills like \nelectricity, water, mobile and internet\n without fail!\n Thankfully there\u2019s no concept of \nmaintenance charges\n in one-room-kitchen house.\n \nNow, I\u2019ll tell you why I mentioned things I don\u2019t have.\n \nThose are the things which motivate me, help me, make me work hard and morally boost myself to succeed and enjoy a better life, for me and my parents. They have and are still striving hard to raise me up. Now that I\u2019ve almost completed graduation in Engineering \nit\u2019s my time to grab opportunities, fly high and bring back the bright version of life which my parents expect!\nSo, yes, there are poor people on Quora because all you need to have is a \nwillingness\n to learn/know new things, a little bit of \ntechnical knowledge\n to login to Quora from any device and of course \nsome money \nto recharge internet or use someone\u2019s internet service!\n \nTo summarize my answer, any person staying in this suburban city of Mumbai can compare the amounts I mentioned in my answer and are intelligent enough to declare me \na poor person on Quora\n!\n \nThank you! :)\nEDIT - 29 Sept 2020 :\n \nI felt the need to edit this answer due to the overwhelming response and the blessings I had over the years. I \ngot a decent job \nin mid-2017 and I\u2019m working since then. My salary is in a decent lower 5 digit figure now.\n \nIn these 3 years, I saved money and purchased my first smartphone of 5K INR within a year. Recently, due to the memory issue of the previous smartphone, I purchased \na new good quality budget smartphone of 16K INR\n so that I can use it for more years.\n \nI also purchased \na good quality laptop with decent high specifications of 44K INR\n, again for the same reason. I always believe in saving money and purchasing good quality products and maintaining them for the long term.\n \nI\u2019m still learning new technologies with the help of the internet and the devices I have now. I still have a long way to go! Thanks! :)"

Neither exist anymore, by the way. Because many people think that churches are welfare agencies and if they don\u2019t get everything they demand, we are horrible hypocrites. Sometimes we just don\u2019t have it, and are POOR, like the rest of you.

I\u2019m a poor guy as far as my financial situation is concerned not with my attitude or dreams.\n \nI come from a very poor family background with Big Dreams. We used to live in a small village with a monthly income of Rs. 6,000. My mother who is a tailor who is the only source of our family, she sacrificed her life for the benefit of our family development but things are not going as she used to think. I don\u2019t want to talk about my father, though physically he is there, he is not contributing to our family in any way rather he used to torture my mother every time. He is completely addicted to alcohol. I had a younger brother who is completely deaf and dumb, this has become one more challenging task for our family. As we are not financially capable, no one used to support us, including our relatives. I can\u2019t explain my pain within crispy words. Nowadays, the so-called Vitamin M (money) is the only criteria for anything, you may accept it or you may not accept it.\n \nAiming :\n \nSo, I aimed big to wage a war against my poverty, I decided to become a Civil Servant, so that I\u2019ll get recognition and fame. At that time, I thought, education was the only solution for me.\n \nMy Journey :\n \nI had no money to go and stay in Hyderabad. So, I\u2019ve written Osmania University Entrance examination for my post graduation on the advice of my English Lecturer, actually my plan is to get shelter and then prepare for my IAS examination. By God\u2019s grace everything went very well. I got good rank and I joined there for my post graduation. (For my preparation only)\n \nAshok Nagar, Hyderabad :\n \nI\u2019ve no idea about the civil services examination, so I decided to go for coaching. I\u2019ve had my search for the best coaching institution in Hyderabad, where thousands and lakhs of people are roaming around the Ashok Nagar cross roads in the name of IAS coaching. Actually, it is more than a business and business of business. I\u2019m not in a position to cope up with big institutions where the crowd is so high. Then, I decided to choose the institution with minimum strength.\n \nCivil Services Mission:\n \nI don\u2019t want to mention the institution name but I found it. Things were going on my way. But here comes challenge again, I need to pay Rs.60,000 for my coaching. I had no idea how to pay.\n \nThanks for the Internet. I used to search on the Google for helping hands to support me, actually I\u2019ve sent more than 2500 emails to different NGOs and trusts all over the India, including few persons individually whom I found on Google.\n \nI got few positive responses. Fortunately, I got support from them to continue my preparation. I paid the fee and I started working on my mission.\n \nStruggles and Sorrows:\n \nI had only three pairs of dresses. If I want to go for coaching I\u2019ve to wear the one dress for two to three days.\n \nI did all the Hard Work what I can do. My only ambition is to get into the civil services. No other exams.\n \nI\u2019ve written IAS examination 4 times in a row but failed to clear it. Twice, I had my mains. But no result. As I\u2019m zero at maths, I was not in a position to take any other bank or SSC examination.\n \nDay and night struggles, I\u2019ve had my tears. Things were changed at my home, mother and brother got hospitalized. My father is not caring anything about our family. I came back I\u2019ve taken care of my family.\n \nFailure and Impact :\n \nEverybody is used to point me, they used to show me as a symbol of failure. I may failed in my IAS examination but I\u2019m not going to fail in my life. I\u2019m a fighter, though I failed in civil services, I learned a lot from the journey. How can a single sheet of examination paper can decide my future? Everybody is Unique, right?\n \nNo contacts. No relationships. No money.\n \nApproaching the Politicians :\n \nAs I\u2019ve had immense knowledge as far as administration and policy making is concern, I approached few politicians to work as an assistant to them. But got rejected everywhere.\n \nEntrepreneurial Journey :\n \nFormal education will make you a living but Self-education will make you a Fortune. As the start-up revolution is going in India, I had a question in my mind \u2013 why don\u2019t I start my career as an entrepreneur?\n \nI\u2019ve had my ideas, I worked on it but again the lack of funding has become the major concern for me. Whatever the start-up idea I\u2019ve in my mind, it has become a $100 million dollars company in USA. Of course, you may believe or you may not.\n \nNow???\n \nNow, I\u2019m no longer in a position to write any examination or no longer want to work under someone. I want to become a self-made entrepreneur in any way. I\u2019m not going to give up on my dreams.\n \n\u201cif the plan is not working, change the plan but not the Goals\u201d.\n \n\u201cBody has it\u2019s limitations but mind has no limits\u201d\n \nThis information age is giving enormous amount of opportunity to each and every individual. I wanted to catch it and cash out.\n \nYour Help is Needed :\n \nI would love to welcome your suggestions or advices or help or criticism in any way.\n \nI may not be the perfect guy to answer you but I can feel and express my opinion by stepping into your shoes in a perfect way.\n \nI\u2019m not giving up rather I\u2019m challenging myself to get what I want. I\u2019ll persist until I succeed. For me, the true happiness always lies in Fighting.\n \nThanks For Being Awesome,\n \nSURESH MADHA !!!"

Inequality, wealth and poverty. We all heard about starvation in Africa and people living on a couple of dollars in Asia. But that thread on Quora introduces not only them, but also tells about people living in the US and Europe, but being poor by standards of life there.\n \nI want to thank all people, who shared their stories here. Reading answers, I learned how poor I am thinking that poverty is just about money. Thanks to all the answers here, I found 3 lessons on having more happy life:\nWant more\nWork more\nCompare to less.\nLesson #1: Want more\nI always want more. We all do this, right? We even have a saying for that: A soldier who doesn't want to be a general is a bad soldier. Which means you must want more or otherwise you're wrong.\n \nPeople answering that question shared their stories of going from cruel poverty to comparably better living. They make high standards for themselves, they put goals and achieve them.\n \nLesson 2: Work more\nThat's simple. If you make no effort, you will make no progress. You'll get nowhere. No work, no money; no bees, no honey.\n \nPeople on Quora have to work in the grain field for a couple of $ a day to pay for their education. They learn and work without restraint to overcome the cycle of poverty.\n \nLesson 3: Compare to less\nI always compare myself to people who have more: more money, more knowledge, more free time, more muscles, more beard... It seems natural to all of us.\n \nBut what if we start comparing to those, who have less than we do? This post on Quora is a cold shower every time I start complaining of how tired I am, or how unlucky I am living in Ukraine, or how cheap my work is.\n \nComparing to those, who have fewer switches you from grudge to thankfulness. You learn how much you already have.\n \nI am not going to preach that we should stop to want more and enjoy the silence of wealth. But I like how this simple question on Quora reminds us to appreciate what we take for granted."

He is a totally undeserved blessing that is beyond my comprehension as to why I was gifted with him.\n \nOffspring are blessings, so that is one important, non-monetary measurement.\n \nFurther, I received the \u201c\"gift of faith\u201d in Christ, as a child, and I am persisting in my very flawed and unremarkable pursuit of as much of what I know He wants me to be, have and do as I know how to and that I have the willingness to cooperate with him to pursue.\n \nAnother important yardstick.\n \nThird, I have reasonably good health and was given strength in the physical part of life, though the strong appetites that often accompany generally good health I have exploited to my disadvantage.\n \nNow, by the world\u2019s standards, I have clean-enough water to bathe in; I buy distilled water to drink and cook with; I have 650 square feet with a roof over it all, and doors that have yet to be breached, despite the higher incidence of crime where I live; I have \u201c\"stuff,\u201d like an old smart phone, a 32\u2033 tv, an old laptop, some worn out clothes.\n \nPretty rich, as compared to literally 4/5ths or more of the world\u2019s population. But, as compared to what my parents had when they were my age (I\u2019m 59), I am hardly \u201c\"eking our\u201d a living and there is little hope for financial security in my fast-approaching \u201cold age.\u201d\n \nI have no car (unlike 95% of my city\u2019s population), nothing in the bank, my glasses are 14 years old and taped together on both sides; I also haven't seen a doctor or a dentist for 14 years; and the last time I wore a pair of shoes that were new, decent, department-store shoes was when my son was four years old (18 years ago), when my sister decided to take me shopping and buy me some nice things.\n \nI walk and bicycle the two miles to my job, a job which requires me to stand all day and leaves me so tired and sore at the end of the day that I am hardly able to do anything once I get home, or on my days off.\n \nIs it poverty to not be able to go to a good doctor? Or is the worse torture having ideas that could solve one\u2019s financial restraints you cannot take action to execute due to limits in one\u2019s energy level means?\n \nI experience the second as the worst.\n \nMany people in the USA, maybe it\u2019s even fair to say most, live in their own little world and are oblivious as to the conditions that others whom they per chance see at the store, or walking by them on the sidewalk, or sitting next to them at church, are enduring.\n \nThere are more people in the USA that are poor in the monetary sense than meets the eye.\n \nPerhaps most people don't see the scores of thousands that are only a couple weeks from homelessness. And who don\u2019t by any means have \u201call\u201d their basic needs met because that would crowd out the pleasant self-satisfaction that the richer enjoy on a daily basis, as they get hair cuts and dental work and dinners out that the \u201cpoor\u201d cannot afford to count on to lift their spirits or buoy their resolve for tomorrow\u2019s demands.\n \nProverbs 29:2 in the bible says: \u201cWhen the righteous rule, the people rejoice; but when the wicked are on top, the people mourn.\u201d I think the number of people who are mourning in America is getting larger and has been doing so for about 45 years.\n \nIf you live in the US, the next time you see a stranger ask yourself \u2018How can I tell for sure when the last time was that that person had a good meal?\u2019\n \nFOOTNOTE: In the Colorado county where I live (El Paso), and where the headquarters of Focus on the Family, and Compassion International, and International Bible Study, and The Navigators, are located, all world- renown Christian organizations, one-third of all school aged children go to bed hungry every night.\n \nAre they as hungry as Mali\u2019s 7.5 million kids under 15 years of age who are often left with no option other than to turn tricks for the ones with money so they can keep \u201cearning\u201d their right to stay at the mosque where the local imams bring one child of every household to serve Allah?\n \nProbably not.\n \nBut can a country who doesn't feed it's own children anymore qualify as a leader of the free world? Also, probably not."

Well, i guess 15% of that traffic is contributed by 90% of the users using Jio. All you need to make a account on Qoura is an email address and two eyes to put them at required places. They don\u2019t ask for fancy bank statements. Indeed, India is not as rich, so yes there is a huge number of people who are not financially sound. I hate using the word poor."

My friends taught me how to use Facebook, Nimbuzz and YouTube.\n \nI requested my mother to make my father purchase a\nn\n Internet enabled phone. My mother asked about the cost of the same. I told 2\u20133 thousand for basic keypad and 4\u20135 thousand for screen touch phone. Firstly my mother refused to help me. But later when I told her that all my friends having internet enabled screen touch phone for study, at least you should talk about basic keypad phone.\n \nMy mother told the same to my father. After 1\u20132 week later I again asked my mother. My mother any how gave me 5,000 Rupees. I want to ask my mother..but she scold me \u2026not to ask any question. I didn't purchase any phone and put back that money in my mother's wallet. Next day my mother was asking about my phone, I replied \u2026Nhi mummy, main dosto k phone se hi kaam Chala lunga. Mere admission ke liye Kam aa jayenge wo rupye ( \nNo, I can manage with my friend's phone. That money will help me to take admission)\n My mother told \u2026Tu le le..apni cheez apni hoti h..wo kab tak dikhayenge tujhe ( \nYou should buy\u2026.)\n \nFinally I got my Nokia 5233 in June 2011. I tried to search all those things what I want to.. earlier.\n \nMy father asked me \u2026what have you thought about your next study. I told my father, I want to take admission in B.Tech. Banks are providing Education Loan easily now a days.\n \nI took admission in a private college which was near to my home because if I take admission far away from my home. It will be more expensive.\n \nTwo of my friends also pursuing b.tech in that college. We all three go to college by one old hero motorcycle and expenses were equally divided.\n \nI never thought about the expenditures except college fee, I used to suffer economically by stationary, books and assignments expenses. I was consuming half of my family income.\n \nI sold my Nokia 5233 which helping me a lot in study especially assignments.\n \nDay by day my family\u2019s economic condition going down.\n \nI started to teach my neighbor's children to earn some money to bear college expenses. (\nGenerally many students came to study at my home in vacation but earlier I didn't charge any amount for that\u2026 luckily their parents came to request me to spare some of my time to teach their children in lieu of that they offerred me tuetion fee\ns)\n \nBut it affecting my study\u2026also there is a tension in my mind seeing my family condition. One of my elder sister awaiting to get married.\n \nI think to quit my study and start submitting some forms for government Job. (\nAlso there was a rumour that time , future of b.tech \nis \nnot secure as there are many students wandering after b.tech\n). So I strongly start believing in that.\n \nI appeared in many exam for government Job, many of my classmates also doing same. They think a government peon is far better than a unemployed engineer.\n \nFinally I got a call letter from (don't want to mention organization\u2019s name). My parents want to stop me to join that service but there is one more problem our paternal house divided in four parts and my father got only 25 square foot of land. It was also a necessity to build that part to live. (\nI'm unable to upload pics as I had no camera phone that time)\n \nAlso my younger brother\u2019s basic education has been totally effected by working in fields as my parents \nhas \ngrown old ( we have a small piece of agriculture land and some cattles)\n \nThe sole responsibility to take my family forward was on my shoulder. Seeing no other option I joined that service. Now I am not saying that\u2026 I m earning good (what I want) but I am capable to carry all the responsibility of my family. Last year in December my sister got married. My brother completed graduation.\n \nYou will ask when I joined Quora ?\n \nAns : To check..you can go through my profile. Usually I didn't get enough time to write, But I love to read answers."

primary school. this had to happen after my parents separated after a very long domestic violence{which mother narrates to me since that time i was a toddler} when we moved to a different county our life was full of struggles for mum had to work as a casual laborer in potato farms and earn not more than 3$ we are a family of 7 boys and six girls though at the time we moved to the later county all the sisters were married and my two brothers and non was well up to support us younger siblings. before i forget my dad had married a second wife and had 8 siblings besides us,4 boys and 4 girls,the second wife was younger than my mum and i think its because of her that dad discriminated us, but unfortunately a year before we vacated she died.i want to clearly state that since the age i came to realize my self i can only recall two different instances when i saw my dad at home { since age 3 to age 6} i too wanna add that i never at one point saw him smiling. and most of the times he came home{ according to mum} he could just quarrel out of nothing solid, he could go to an extent of beating mum. this makes me shed tears when i remember this,ooooh no i love my mum!!\n \nconsequently mum had to look food for five boys [my mum is not educated, she only went up to class 2} and thus cant find such a good job. after she had hustled quite good money {9$} she took the five of us a government primary school and paid the whole amount of 9$ as enrollment fee.school fees had to be paid later with installments. that was the time i joined class one. we were a poor family to an extent that we didn't have good clothes, food but not shelter since we were living in my grandmothers homestead who had died a couple of years ago.\n \ngod is good, when i did my final primary exam i passed well.i received an admission letter from a national school but i couldn't join since there wasn't enough funds to pay my fees {at this age i was bit mature and i could understand what was going on in our family. without any argument mum proposed a local school which was not far from home but i chose a different one which was also a local school but was a bit far from home {8km} which i could walk to and fro everyday. since i couldn't afford bus fair and the school had no bus.the reason why i chose the school was that it was the best day school it that region and i was determined to pass regardless of the circumstance. i went through a sequence of struggles which among them was: the obvious tiresome journey, being sent home for fees and having low esteem due to being looked down upon by some students from well up families among other things including lack of cash to purchase novels, textbooks and such related staffs. i used to borrow books from friends and read them especially when they are not using them, my best subject is chemistry and nobody was beating me in this , i also loved English though it had \u201cowners\u201d. when i sat for my final exams which i really gave my best, i happened to pass the exam { not forgetting my friends who used to lend me books failed!!} i don't take pride in this but there is one thing that has been ringing in my mind ever since \u201cGod has a good purpose over my life. i really love god. i normally pray and i can say that god has done it in my life . in our great country we usually receive funds {loan} from the government

Really the opposite is true.\n \nI have only little money in the bank and few possessions which are much more than some but a lot less than others. I budget right down to the last penny and make sure my partner and I do our best to spend our money wisely. We often have little food in cupboards but not completely empty.\n \nI struggle everyday with physical and mental difficulties which are difficult plus I care for my partner too. We have been together 10 years and have 2 gorgeous beautiful cats who we love very much. I also now have a small family due to loss and grief but I still have some family, ones who I am very close to. Currently I am studying Higher Education Certictifcate in Children and Families and after I hope to gain a BA degree, maybe even one day an MA!!\n \nYes I am poor as I have little money and only a few posssesions but what I do have is family, a partner I love plus his family, 2 cats who bring us both joy, one lovely and very supportive friend, a kind heart, a decent enough brain, passion, determination, and the drive to work hard and succeed in life.\n \nI don't want to live off others I want to help others. I want to learn and I want to learn from others who are experienced and knowledgable in thier field. They inspire me everyday with thier hard work and love of wanting change in the world. I know what it is like to be judged and to be seen as something you are not. I know what it is like to be a very highly sensitive child and have a need for reassurance and security, I know what it is like to be a \u2018service user\u2019 or \u2018patient\u2019 of both physical and mental illness and feel frustrated with the difficulties of health and social care services.\n \nI want to work my way up to a place where I am no longer \u2018poor\u2019 as in having little money but will stay wonderfully rich in all the other areas of my life maybe even more so. Also keep my morals and principles, being the fair and decent person I like to see myself as and still in 20, 30 or 40 odd years time or however long I have on this earth when I will hopefully be reunited with my loved ones I have lost. I have to have faith in that as if i didn't have faith I would have nothing.\n \nSo yes there are poor people on this site but most will only be poor in one area or part of thier life with regards to money. Most other areas will be rich and full of love and life. When you have little money you value what is actually important in life."

Before that, I lived on a sofa in an apartment shared with two alcoholics/occasional crack smokers for $300/month and the internet was included. Before that, I had a job and was living in a $750/month bachelor apartment paying the aforementioned local isp $30/month for internet. Before that, I had no job and internet was included, before that it was included, before that it was included, before that it was included. If one pays rent, there is usually internet. Except for the bachelor, the one case where internet was not included, the duplex, was when the landlord was a literal psychopath.\n \nI have used Quora for 4\u20135 years. For the latter 3 of years I have been poor. I originally started using Quora to acquaint myself with tech culture. I was an arts major and wanted to find my way into the tech sector. I never found my way into the tech sector, but I was well prepared to witness the considerable changes seen in society on account of the almost unprecedented recent advancements in technology. I focused on learning to manage and save money until the information given through Quora became repetitive; my parents were not able to endow me with this perspective. After, I focused on ways to make money. I\u2019ve found recurring viable methods which I believed were suitable for me mentioned. Investing in real estate. ecommerce. Trading stocks and currencies. Then I realized these all take initial resources to begin making money with. There are good reasons I\u2019m poor and these methods are not for me at this time. This is where I\u2019m at now.\n \nMany things I\u2019ve realized through Quora have significantly shaped who I am as a person. There is a lot less uncertainty for me in regards to how money can be made, kept and spent. Before Quora, did I think a millionaire had access to whatever luxury? Probably yes. Now I know one million dollars is not a lot of money. Twenty million dollars is a lot of money, in my opinion. I\u2019m given $1050/month through disability assistance, by the way. In any case, a millionaire does not necessarily have the ability to choose between all luxuries. I\u2019ve learned ideas come and go. They don\u2019t have to be trendy, sophisticated and certainly not world-changing to make money. Since I\u2019m now focusing on making a living beginning with the amount of resources I have on hand, my most recent ideas for doing so have been focusing on growing a particular kind of mushroom and getting a newspaper route. I have seen the mushrooms sold in health food stores at a very high cost. I know the market on them is cornered. The mushrooms are esoteric, produced in a small amount of far off facilities and I believe I know how, discovered through local lore no less, to grow them more effectively. The newspaper route, I believe I might just be able to manage most immediately.\n \nSo- this poor person uses Quora with a focus on learning to make a living. Along with a close friend, this site helps me maintain momentum on the path to finding a career. I use it to learn, sometimes as a way to keep busy, to express myself. For perspective I did not have access to previously, inspiration, mentorship. I want to contribute to society while doing right by my needs, if you will, and clarifying both those ends is an ongoing process for me. Not to imply you think poor people may necessarily have distinct reasons for using Quora, but to state poor people have the same reasons for using Quora as those otherwise do; I am a curious and rational animal with internet access."

It was impossible for that guy to sustain his family with his earnings. My dad remained unemployed for a short time, as he couldnt get another one. Finally, He took up the job of a driver then eventually joining to one of my father\u2019s senior to the same company. Seeing my father\u2019s condition he offered to help and financed to some extent mine and my brother's educational expenses. I continued studying in the same school, ranked in top 10 schools of the state. Later on I moved to another school which was supposedly less expensive, in my high school. Took up science and wished to pursue MBBS and end the struggle my father did. He wished to see us well educated. Coaching seemed to be expensive so I didnt join any institute and went up with self study. I got a decent rank in NEET but it was not enough to fetch me a seat in a government college. Looked up to previous years results and found out that I had a 50-50 chance. Private medical colleges are a tad too much expensive. I thought of dropping an year but then again I had a short councelling with my father's friend who helped my father financially uptil now. Since completing my studies and starting my career would take atleast 15 years, I thought of dropping the idea altogether. I had a younger brother too, just two years younger to me. HENCE, I DIDNT SIT FOR COUNCELLING. Later on I found out that I could have got a seat in a govt college, but I have no regrets. I appeared for the engineering entrance too, on my fathers suggestion though not completely prepared. Even then I scored decently and was finally admitted to a private engineering college ranked in top 3 in my state. This too seemed unaffordable and hence took an educational loan for the same. Thats where I am now.\n \nHere come's the catch.\n I MADE NO FRIENDS. NOT A SINGLE ONE I CAN COUNT AS MY FRIEND. \n \n I was in my middle school when I was bullied a number of times by the \"richer\" one's of my batchmates. Well that was really awful and remember all those to this day. Really insulting. Later on I changed school and here I kept mum about my father's occupation. Whichever friend I made were kept a little way from my personal life limited to school only. I carried on with my studies but later on I felt It was wrong for my part. There wasn't any excuse to keep mum. But I carried on. With my school days over I dont think I will be able to make friends either. Everyone around me is counted as my competitor. I was relieved to find a few people on my first months in college whom I could count on but everthing went down as it came. We were considered notorious bunch, thanks to a few and hence were redistributed into two sections in the second semester, just 6 months into college. Later on some serious issues crept up and we split into smaller groups. The management succeded.\n \nThe closest ones that fit in th definition as a friend were a bunch of three in my high school, but still I kept them away from my personal life. Almost forgotten by now, as it seems. I didnt make any memories either and seems difficult for me living up later on.\n \nAs of now, was too much depressed by holding up so many things within me, adding the uncertainity of my future as an engineer. \nI dont count myself poor. I got the best opportunities possible, all thanks to my dad and mum\n. All that to be blamed was I, who made a blunder of myself.\n \nRead up somewhere that writing down all your thoughts relieves a bit.\n \nDidn\n\u2019\nt want to draw much attention hence went anonymous.\n \nThank You."

To explore this, it's essential to consider several key factors, including the global digital divide, the nature of poverty, and the demographics of Quora's user base.\nThe Global Digital Divide: Despite the increasing affordability of internet access, a significant digital divide persists worldwide. This divide is not just about access to the internet but also about the quality of access, including speed and reliability. While in many developed countries, high-speed internet is ubiquitous and relatively cheap, in numerous developing countries, access remains limited, expensive, or both. This disparity is evident in the International Telecommunication Union's data, which reveals vast differences in internet penetration rates across different regions.\n \nNature of Poverty: Poverty is a multifaceted issue that involves more than just income levels. It includes aspects like access to education, healthcare, and technology. People living in poverty, even in regions with relatively high internet penetration, may prioritize basic needs such as food and shelter over internet access. Moreover, poverty often correlates with limited educational opportunities, which in turn affects individuals' ability to engage with platforms like Quora that are primarily text-based and require a certain level of literacy and knowledge to navigate and participate effectively.\n \nDemographics of Quora's User Base: Quora, as a platform, tends to attract users who are interested in sharing knowledge and engaging in intellectual discourse. This demographic is likely to include individuals with at least a basic level of education and digital literacy. Consequently, the platform may inherently appeal less to those who, due to socioeconomic constraints, have had limited access to educational resources.\n \nAccessibility and Inclusivity on Quora: While Quora is accessible to anyone with internet access, there are barriers beyond just the physical ability to log onto the site.

That\u2019s for a velocity of over 700 megabytes per second, which is really fast, and there\u2019s no limit to how much I can upload or download.\n \nBut for many Brazilians, that\u2019s really expensive, it\u2019s 10% of their monthly salary for 2/3 of the population. So for the majority of the country internet access isn\u2019t cheap.\n \nInternet service on my phone is R$60.00 (US$12.00) a month. It gives me 22 gigabytes of 4g before my connection speed is reduced to 32k, which works well for text emailing, but that\u2019s about it.\n \nThis price also gives me unlimited calling and unlimited text messages to any landline or cellular phone in Brazil independent of who their or my cellular provider is.\n \nIt\u2019s accompanied with free inter-state roaming, and because it\u2019s a pre-paid plan it\u2019s not linked to the purchase of a phone, so really, it\u2019s not a bad deal.\n \nYet, that still means that a family of four, with both parents working minimum wage jobs, as over 1/2 the country does, is paying R$387.00 (US$78.00) a month for internet and cellular services.\n \nWhen a family makes R$2500.00 (US$500.00) a month, that\u2019s close to 18% of their income, that\u2019s a lot.\n \nNow add in the cost of the phones, which are often financed for two years at interest rates of 10% a month which is 420% a year, yes, you read that right, 420%.\n \nBorrowing money in Brazil is comparable to borrowing money from the mafia in other countries, yet so many people do it, because they want an internet connection.\n \nAnd add in the cost of things like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney and Apple+ on family plans, which aren\u2019t expensive in Brazil, all four cost R$75.00 (US$15.00) a month, much less than in many other countries.\n \nStill, it\u2019s easy to see that for many Brazilians access to the internet is expensive, for half the country it literally affects the amount of food you can eat and what neighborhood you can afford to live in.\n \nSo, yes, there are poor people on Quora, even if internet services in Brazil are 20% of the price they are in the United States.\n \nThe other answers I have read to this question also say the same thing. For a large percentage of people, the internet isn\u2019t cheap."

And by god's grace I got free seat in one of the top 10 engineering Colleges in Hyderabad. Then I moved to another hostel at Uppal in Hyderabad. I chose that hostel so that my father would pay the less amount of rent(Rs.3000/- per month, which is the minimum amount of rent in that area). I teach home tuitions for two hours in the evening after returning from the college to support my father somewhat financially. Now, due to corona I am not doing that and I came to my hometown. These days, I came to know how hard my father works daily to lead our family. He always tries his best to provide us with all we want. I am happy to say that I am blessed with lovable parents and supportive sibling. I feel rich to have them.\n \nI am going to enter into the final year of my bachelors very soon. I wish I could get placed in one of the reputed companies and overcome our poverty and make my parents happy.\nAnd ofcourse I could use this platform since I could get internet for cheap.

(Which she did not complete, as it was still very expensive and student loans are very stressful to have and difficult to keep applying for and getting approved for.)\n \nI left when I was 17 in 2012 and have since been homeless three separate times for a minimum span of one month and a maximum span of around 7 months or so at a time. I am currently on social assistance. I had previously tried to go to university when I was 17 and found myself in hospital for mental illness related issues and had to drop out. I make paintings right now but they don\u2019t generally sell, mainly because I am too ill to manage getting a portfolio together, applying to galleries, and I cannot afford the costs associated with applying.\n \nI often do not eat, and I cannot generally afford luxuries. My rent is $375/month CAD, which is only so low because I share a room with my partner. Utilities are $80/month (internet as part of this), and I have leftover around $100 for basic needs for the month. I try to grocery shop and grow food and bake my own bread whenever I can in order to save on food, and keep an eye on sales on canned food and things like vinegar for cleaning and toilet paper. I share a home with three other adults, ages 19\u201328. We\u2019ve also had homeless friends stay here sometimes when they\u2019ve needed it. (When you live homeless as a young person around here, I think it\u2019s typical to stay at different friends\u2019 places in rotation so as to avoid putting too much pressure on anyone in particular, especially because of the weirdness of social protocol and figuring out whether you count as a guest or a temporary roommate.)\n \nI would love to share pictures of my home but it\u2019s really messy and also I would need to ask my roommates if that\u2019s alright, since the mess belongs to a bit of all of us. I want to thank all the other poor people for sharing pictures and stories of how they live. It makes me feel proud of what little I come from and less lonely to see all of you talking about it."

I live on my Social Security Disability. I live in housing that is some combination of HUD housing (government-subsidized housing) and private organization which owns and manages fully-accessible apartments for people with disabilities. Because I live in a HUD subsidized apartment and because a national cable company has a program for people who live in HUD housing for a nominal fee. I could either buy my modem/router (cost me 120 USD) or pay 5 USD each month for their router/modem (whatever order those words come in). I have a tablet from housesitting money I earn every other weekend. I earn about 120 USD monthly from that job. That money goes to all things past the monthly bills, medical bills, pharmacy (scripts and OTCs both), and personal and household supplies (limited to the basics). Meaning if I want a pair of shoes or a snack or a speaker for my tablet, that comes out of housesitting money. How truly and humbly grateful I am to be a citizen of US. Completely an accident of birth.\n \nAdditional Comment. My friends who I housesit for found out that that same national company provides the same nominal costs for senior citizens. He is older than my friend (his wife) and I, so their household qualifies. Others do too, if interested."

We were free to roam anywhere during the daytime but not at night.\n \nFast-forward to 10\u201312 years later, and here I am typing this under a asbestos 2 room house; that we own. I have a mango tree behind our house and a small verandah at the front. We own a t.v. running fta channels and have access to internet as well (obviously not due to jio effect). Thanks to my parents, all of us three could comprehend fluently in English .\n \nAnd the most important, no one can ever force us to leave.\n \nSo, it's upto you to judge if I'm poor or not . But when a guy wearing a costly t-shirt than yours and bad ranks gets a better seat, you know you are atleast not poor.\n \nSubbhakhair ~"

No one was hiring, or they wanted someone with more experience and a better work history.

Now I have to come up with a car payment, which is 400 a month, but the ex will still pay for the car insurance. I go to a food bank for my food, plus take home messed up pizza orders from work, so the only food I buy is the cat food for my feline companions. And I buy the cheapest I can, so it's only 5$ a month I spend on their food. I pick up extra shifts when I can, which is why my checks are 200$ and not 100$ like my coworkers. I rob peter to pay Paul. And I can't sell my plasma anymore, because I have a false positive for hepatitis a. So I lost out on my income from that. I am still looking for a second job, or a better job.but until then, I am working my ass off to make ends meet, and the ends are so frayed that sometimes I'm afraid they will never meet again.

We have a total income of about 2300$ every month, and that is WAY more than enough for all the luxuries one can think of in a span of 3 seconds.\n \nWe have a car, a 2 BHK flat, 2 inherited bungalows, and a rich heritage. I know, for a fact, that both my parents had to face very hard days, in his childhood, but I don\u2019t have to, thanks to their sincerity in attaining education.\n \nOh, and I study in THE most premiere, and oldest school of my nation.\n \nThen, what do I lack? Why am I even answering this question on Quora?\n \nThe answer, lies in my first sentence. I feel poor everyday. Why? Because, in the school I attend, all students are from extremely wealthy families, with an estimated average income of about $15,500. Pretty much everyone has at least 2 cars, with a chauffeur at their command at all times. They go for expensive dinners and trips. They all have iPhones, Gucci and Versace threads, expensive suits, and a lot of admirers.\n \nOn the other hand, I travel by public transport. My family has ONE car. I don\u2019t have expensive watches, nor phones (not that I need them). Only the usual ones. I have common clothes (not cheapskate, but just \nnormal\n). We dine out at normal restaurants, and I have never been abroad. Only domestic.\n \nSpending hours with these kind of people from societies that I don\u2019t belong to, had been a very sad part of my life. I did not want to attend school anymore. I didn\u2019t want to use public transport anymore. I was tired, sick of my life. The poor kid sleeping on the road would be jealous of my life, but I was sick of it.\n \nThen, I thought about it, I thought how hard my parents work, just for my benefit. I thought, that I must give my parents, what I desire. Not expect them to give it to me. And here I am today, renowned all over my school, as THE artist, THE physicist, THE swimmer, and THE debator.\n \nYes, it was my self confidence, that helped me change myself.

I mean everything. Yes literally everything :( and I regret.\n \nAnd my parents don\u2019t say a single word to them\n \nToday you see me failure but one day I will be success according to you maybe. But I am successful everyday in everyway. You don\u2019t know what happens to me when you speak shit!!!\n \nSo what came to my mind is stop eating and eat only one time. I did that and after 3 days I said my parents that I will eat one time and in this way you can save money on 3 time food I have which will surely equal to job money.\n \nAll I had my wifi, mobile, computer in my room. which are old but my best friends. I love them. I asked them if you want take them too but even if you won\u2019t, you will have to incur expense as everyone in house is using except my mobile.\n \nSo I want to share I am poor for now. In everyway I guess but I am happy :))))))\n \nI ate 3 times in very less portion [2 chapati reduced to 1/4th chapati so that my parents don\u2019t feel anything]\u2026.thank you God.\n \nI am successful in everything, everyway!!!!! Lolzzz\u2026Not poor but poor\u2026..\n \nHapppppppyyyyyyy :))))))))"

But you are on the internet, you are therefore un-poor enough to be wasting your time doing nothing.\n \nPeople always talk about India, Africa, South America etc when they talk about being poor.\n \nDo you realise that in Italy a few years ago they changed the law to say that stealing food is not a crime and shouldn\u2019t be punished if you are doing it because you are hungry - why? Because people were doing it.\n \nI am from England. I was in foster care from the age of 10, growing up I met people who slept in the same bed as 4\u20136 siblings, people who would go out and have to wash cars or do paper rounds so that they could feed themselves. People who, at the age of 13 were sent to prison for theft, burglary or dealing drugs because they required money as they had no other means of getting it. That isn\u2019t mentioning the fact there are families who \nhave \nto take their older siblings hand-me-down clothes. Not because they are smaller but because there is no money to pay for anything else.\n \nBeing poor is completely relative to the situation and place you live in, if you live in London, you cannot live a measly wage, you live in certain parts of the West Midlands, Wales and many other places - you can eat very well buying shopping \u00a320 per week (this is pocket money after having paid bills).\n \nThe UK is one of the most expensive countries in which to live, because of the fact that we have an awful lot of greedy rich people, we are a small ass island, our currency being worth the most in the world market also means that the business owners are stingy with it. People used to get paid for their skills, nowadays because there are so many people out there looking for jobs, practically every job pays minimum wage. Unless you live in a bedsit - one room with bedroom, kitchen (sometimes shared), bathroom (most of the time shared with two other people) - you cannot live on your own. Basic rent for a house/ flat in my city which is not poor but not great either is around \u00a3550 per month, then you have 80-\u00a3120 council tax, \u00a330 water, \u00a330 gas, \u00a330 electric (these are estimates). This before you are talking about food, travel expenses, clothing, having children, phones etc.\n \nContrary to popular belief, most people in the so called first world countries are not rich or do not have more money, yes we might have more than others, however most of it is on credit. This means that most people don\u2019t actually own anything that is theirs - \nthey may owe thousands for university (and will be paying it for the rest of their lives)\n they owe thousands for their car\n credit cards (a lot of people require this because they cannot pay everything out then survive until the end of the month), they don\u2019t own their homes, the banks do, they are paying the banks back little by little, the average household takes about 50 years for two people to pay it off. \nphone contracts - on credit\n \n*Edit: 1 bedroom flats in my city start at \u00a3650 (cheap) a single person on the most common wage of minimum wage will only earn about \u00a31020 after tax."

Most of the time we don\u2019t have money to buy snacks at school. Almost all my clothes are handdown from my sisters. But all this things doesn\u2019t made me feel poor. Mostly because of my Mother\u2019s teaching\u2026she always say we are not poor; we have a roof over our head, we are able to go to school, we have food despite the difficulty and most of all we have each other to lean on. This I had strongly believed was and will always be my greatest treasure in life. No one is poor as one way or another we have wealth in each of us, and this wealth can never be measure by how much money you have in the bank or how expensive your gadgets are. Knowledge is wealth, good health is wealth, love is wealth, genuine Friends is wealth and Everyone in this world is born and raised with these Wealth all around us. This is the world\u2019s way of being fair to Everyone, by being unfair; No one can have it all. In a world where people see themselves of what they lack and take for granted what we already had, I hope I made you felt Rich. Everyone is Poor as Everyone is Rich in their own ways.

My income alone is insufficient to keep us above the poverty line, and it is tough to survive at this level. Yet we are lucky because there is light at the end of the tunnel and we will eventually have a retirement income from his former place of employment.\n \nI suspect we are not the only Quorans below the poverty line. My generation is supposedly the first in which people were unlikely to reach the level of prosperity their parents had achieved, and my students were even more unlucky - I taught in 2007 and the economy crashed that year, leaving most of my college seniors with no prospects of landing a job in their profession so that they could make payments on their student loans, which would start coming due just after graduation. Most left the state and moved around seeking any job they could find, leaving our state impoverished for young people to keep things going.\n \nThis is the effect of many decades of \u201ctrickle down economics\u201d. The name and theory sound good, but in essence it requires pumping all the wealth up the to wealthiest people in the world, who do their best to hoard everything they get, with reasonable success. A bit does trickle back down to the middle classes and even less to the poor, but nothing compared to what the economic and tax policies have taken from us. And the latest tax restructuring policy is \u201ctrickle down\u201d on steroids; it will be about 15 times worse for the economy than the current tax policy. I\u2019m glad I never had kids, I will not have to watch them struggle worse than I had to in this wreck of a nation we are leaving to the next generations. There is no longer any shame to being poor, it is apparently the policy of the government to keep us that way so that we can\u2019t rise up and set things right again."

At least after Ambani threw of his money in the form of free JIO NET SERVICE, the internet has become extremely cheap.\n \nBut still, I believe the one who plays with his thoughts and wants to share his thoughts will stop for nothing. In this era, one can find a lot of resources. So one who wanna write and wants to keep writing, wants purple should read him then he will stop for nothing.\n \nSomeone quoted this -\nNot everyone comes with great talent, but a great talent can come from anywhere.\nA writing means sharing. Whether it is knowledge or some random facts and thoughts writing can help him share it to various people.\n \nAnd obviously, Quora plays a big role here. It might become a true basement or platform to share his view and let it reach to the whole world.\n \nSo, Quora isn't just for rich people or only poor people. Writing and sharing are not just for poor or rich people. Everyone has ideas and everyone jas a new story. A story to share to the whole world.\n \nPoor or rich, when there a pen in his hand and thoughts in his mind, there is always a story.\n \nEveryone has a story. Poor and rich everyone has to say something.\n \nSo yes poor people exist in Quora.\n \nHave a great day!\n \nYours, Lord Sparos"

But when my father died in 2014 my mother offered by US$30,000 to buy a new car.\n \nI bought an old one instead, and sold (eventually gave) the old one to young friends staring a family, To date I have managed to spend only about $12,000.\n \nI make a bit over $800 a month.\n \nBefore I lost the ability to sleep last year, I used to do one or two expert witness cases (for the defense) a year. Until last year I had been charging the State less than 20% of the going rate. This year I had to turn down two jobs (no sleep, no expert.)\n \nSince I am relatively rich compared to many friends, I have lent money to them off and on for years. I charge Credit Union rates +1% and unlike most lenders I am not concerned about regular payments. At the bottom of the economy, even a small unanticipated expense can cost you several times the expense in fines and penalties as you can\u2019t pay other bills. All I ask is that people stay in touch and let me know about any issues. Their only alternative is often the usurious payday and auto title loan places which charge around 22% interest every two weeks. I cannot abide good people being raped like that. So I did something, and mostly it works. Payments can be erratic, I have one loan on hold because the family has an adult daughter fighting an autoimmune disease, incorrectly diagnosed by her doctor, but correctly diagnosed by her mother, who thankfully is a force to be reckoned with.\n \nI spend about 10% of my income on phone and internet, My cell costs about $12 a month. Much of the rest goes to electricity and gas and food.\n \nYears ago, when I determined that money is totally valuless once people no longer trust it, and that banks could and were inflating the currency faster than wages were rising, I decided to invest in friendship\u2014which is more useful than waste paper.\n \nMy emergency food supply consists mostly of chocolate, because it is both stable in storage and as a luxury good should be good for far more food in trade than say, beans."

This leads into the other part. Because I have to pay so much for internet I cannot afford to have TV. Hope that answers your question. If it does not though we have a $50,000 income a year, but because of mortgage and the ever growing expense of groceries and rising prices of utilities we cannot even afford TV.

CommunicationService providers like BSNL and MTNL and Private cos,charge very high fees for data,voice and messages.They say that they will choose the best plan and change plans to earn more. Even if the \nFULL quantity \nof data,calls or messages offerred in plans are \nnot used\n, \none must pay full fare.\nFree Allowance of Calls,Messages are \nhttp://reduced.No\n Free Data is given as before.Data Speed is slow even if it is said to be \nhttp://fast.It\n wastes Data allowance given for fees.Users are made to use and pay for more Data.Service providers cheat by excess fares but do not care for unduly more SerTax paid by users on it. Govt or other organisations force people to use electronic ways to apply for seats in colleges,scholarship,jobs,examinations,petitions toCPGRAMS,IRDA,CLB,SEBI,etc.,Welfare Benefits, ration card,file IncomeTax or other returns,See Form 26AS,etc.,Claim refunds,send Printed FormV to I.T.Dept,File Returns under E.S.I. and other acts, apply to Tenders, etc.Taxis,Airlines,Shippers,hotels,tour operators,agents or users reserve cargo space/seat/Room online.\nCancellation of tickets is charged for by a Fee\n.ServTax/GST is levied on it.Online jobs:Goods like raw/processed food,medicines,minerals,etc.,shares are bought or sold in Wholesale & Retail markets Nationally/Internationally;Conferences/Training;transactions in Banking,Mutual Funds, Insurance,Property;Transfer of Data,text pictures or News for Television/Newspapers;Jobs like advertising,data entry,copying,pasting and processing,DTP,by unfortunate people like poor or not well qualified,retired,widowed,disabled people who \ncould not get jobs in govts or pvt organisations\n and by sheer \nMISERY\n \nforced to buy Personal Computers, Printers,etc.,\n and \nWORK AT HOME\n,by paying big fees to agents to be given jobs and not be sure of full payment as fines are levied on errors made,Composing articles,stories,etc., for newspapers & magazines,book writing,designing,etc.THE LIST IS ENDLESS.Those who do not own or know how to use electronic devices must use others who do and must pay them fees.Many documents like photos,PAN,Bank details,certificates,Aadhaar,etc., are copied and attached to applications electronically.InternetBrowsingShops levy high fee for such jobs,Browsing/Copying.Poor or ignorant students or other people waste much money,time or effort on them.Channel T.V. Companies and Agents charge varying rates in the same area,now take more after tax.The cost is raised by service providers and Govt by GST.SerTax was at 15%,too high compared to a former rate of a high 10%.It was raised to 18% from 1.7.17. \nIt misuses and Exploits misery\n.\nIt forces people to \nunduly, unwittingly and unwillingly pay more to use internet to\n make India \nhttp://DIGITAL.It\n discourages and makes them to stop or reduce using \nhttp://internet.It\n is a disincentive for people who are \nVICTIMS of Digitalising India\n.Users do not profit by it.They mostly lose money.The Govt must encourage by not taxing. SerTax/GST MUST BE \nFULLY REMOVED\n \nAS GOVT ALSO TAKES INCOME TAX ON INCOME EARNED BY COMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM FARES THEY TAKE FROM USERS OF COMMUNICATION SERVICES.IT IS UNFAIR DOUBLE TAXATION OF USERS OF COMMUNICATION SERVICES.

It could be a story of dreams, friendship, hope, survival or even death. And every story is worth telling. But more than that, it\u2019s worth living.\n \nPeople need stories. Stories of love, hope, survival, wisdom and sometimes pain. Maybe you don\u2019t tell them the full truth; maybe you tell them lies. But what is this world? A lie in itself.\n \nNot the people but the mind, Not the storm but the silence, Not the answer but the question, Not the result but the reason, I am scared of. Not the real but the dream, Not the moment but the memory, Not the lie but the truth, Not the death but the life, I am scared of.\n \nTrust me, your struggle, your fight, will be worth the risk in opening yourself up. Get up. Inhale the air of passion. Start your journey. Grab your dreams. Enjoy your mistakes. Dance to the rhythm of your heartbeats. Smile. Laugh. Love. Live.\n \nIf two souls are destined to meet, the universe will always find a way to make the connection. Even when you lose all hope, certain bonds cannot be broken. They show us who we were, who we are and who we can become. Amidst everything, nature will always find a way.\n \n'There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.\n \nBehind every smile there is a frown. Behind every frown there is a story.\n \nWithin that story there was a moment of sadness, but with support from one simple person. We can change their fake smile into a true smile. Helping one another is what keeps others happy and reminds them to still have hope.\n \nLife has it's ups and downs. We cannot change the bad things that have happened to someone, but we can change the sadness they have within because of their past.\n \nLend a helping hand because no one should have to face the world alone. With the people in the world coming to join as one.\n \nWe should start treating one another as brothers and sisters. For if we do we can improve the love in the world.\n \nThere is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.\n \nLet your smile rise & shine.\n \nThis is my Life, This is my Story.\n \nYes. I\u2019m a poor guy as far as my financial situation is concerned not with my Attitude or Goals.\n \nMy name is SURESH, I come from a very poor family background with Big Dreams. We used to live in a small village with a monthly income of Rs. 6,000.\n \nMy mother who is a tailor who is the only source of our family, she sacrificed her life for the benefit of our family development but things are not going as she used to think. I don\u2019t want to talk about my father, though physically he is there, he is not contributing to our family in any way rather he used to torture my mother every time. He is completely addicted to alcohol. I had a younger brother who is completely deaf and dumb, this has become one more challenging task for our family.\n \nAs we are not financially capable, no one used to support us, including our relatives. I can\u2019t explain my pain within crispy words. Nowadays, the so-called Vitamin M (money) is the only criteria for anything, you may accept it or you may not accept it.\n \nI\u2019ve written IAS examination 3 times in a row but failed to clear it. Twice, I had my mains. But no result. As I\u2019m zero at maths, I was not in a position to take any other bank or SSC examination.\n \nDay and night struggles, I\u2019ve had my tears. Things were changed at my home, mother and brother got hospitalized. My father is not caring anything about our family. I came back I\u2019ve taken care of my family.\n \nFailure and Impact :\n \nEverybody is used to point me, they used to show me as a symbol of failure. I may failed in my IAS examination but I\u2019m not going to fail in my life. I\u2019m a fighter, though I failed in civil services, I learned a lot from the journey. How can a single sheet of examination paper can decide my future? Everybody is Unique, right?\n \nNo contacts. No relationships. No money.\n \nApproaching the Politicians :\n \nAs I\u2019ve had immense knowledge as far as administration and policy making is concern, I approached few politicians to work as an assistant to them. But got rejected everywhere.\n \nCivil Services Mission:\n \nI don\u2019t want to mention the institution name but I found it. Things were going on my way. But here comes challenge again, I need to pay Rs.60,000 for my coaching. I had no idea how to pay.\n \nThanks for the Internet. I used to search on the Google for helping hands to support me, actually I\u2019ve sent more than 2500 emails to different NGOs and trusts all over the India, including few persons individually whom I found on Google.\n \nI got few positive responses. Fortunately, I got support from them to continue my preparation. I paid the fee and I started working on my mission.\n \nPart Time Jobs :\n \nI worked in different part time jobs to survive myself. KFC, Big Bazaar, As a Counsellor etc\u2026\n \nStruggles and Sorrows:\n \nI had only three pairs of dresses. If I want to go for coaching I\u2019ve to wear the one dress for two to three days. I did all the Hard Work can do. My only ambition is to get into the civil services. No other exams.\n \nAiming :\n \nSo, I aimed big to wage a war against my poverty, I decided to become a Civil Servant, so that I\u2019ll get recognition and fame. At that time, I thought, education was the only solution for me.\n \nMy Journey :\n \nI had no money to go and stay in Hyderabad. So, I\u2019ve written Osmania University Entrance examination for my post graduation on the advice of my English Lecturer, actually my plan is to get shelter and then prepare for my IAS examination. By God\u2019s grace everything went very well. I got good rank and I joined there for my post graduation. (For my preparation only)\n \nAshok Nagar, Hyderabad:\n \nI\u2019ve no idea about the civil services examination, so I decided to go for coaching. I\u2019ve had my search for the best coaching institution in Hyderabad, where thousands and lakhs of people are roaming around the Ashok Nagar cross roads in the name of IAS coaching. Actually, it is more than a business and business of business. I\u2019m not in a position to cope up with big institutions where the crowd is so high. Then, I decided to choose the institution with minimum strength\n \nEntrepreneurial Journey :\n \nFormal education will make you a living but Self-education will make you a Fortune. As the start-up revolution is going in India, I had a question in my mind \u2013 why don\u2019t I start myself as an entrepreneur?\n \nList of my failures :\n \nCivil Services Examination 1st attempt failure\n \nGroup 1 Examination Failure\n \nCivil Services Examination 2nd attempt failure (cleared mains, failed in personality test)\n \nCivil Services Examination 3rd attempt failure\n \nOne Indian Student, Failed to complete the book\n \nSipCup advertising company Failed\n \nWe Adopt foundation failed due to lack of funds.\n \nFailed to establish myself as a Personal Assistant to A Politician.\n \nMarriage-Money: Realities:\n \nAs a part of my Journey, I approached few marriage bureaus and even I advertised myself on the Shaadi matrimony, looking for some girl or family who can invest and ready to fuel & fulfil my dreams by supporting through money to establish my dream company.\n \nI've approached few, even if the girl is divorced, I'm okay with second match, if she had no kids.\n \n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude39 My madness, the world has no place for Honesty & Loyalty, Money only matters.\n \nApproached few, divorced & 3 are elder to me around 32 & 34 ages. Their response: We don't care about story, all we need someone who can take care our luxury needs. That's all.\n \nI've approached friends & family members, who never believed in my vision, no support.\n \nI've approached my community people, leaders & some of the richest people in my community, no support.\n \nI've approached few IAS officers, Commisisoners, NRIs & Politicians, no support.\n \nTrying my level best to reach angel investors & venture capitalist via LinkedIn & every other platform, no responses are coming.\n \nI gave all my side but it didn\u2019t gave me nothing beside. I gave all my efforts and it gave me nothing as a report. Of course success will hug in private and failure will slap in public. But neither happened to me.\n \nI tried\u2026 cried\u2026 dried\u2026 all myself !!!8\n \nNow???\n \nNow, I\u2019m no longer in a position to write any examination or no longer want to work under someone. I want to become a self-made entrepreneur in any way. I\u2019m not going to give up on my dreams.\n \n\u201cIf the plan is not working, change the plan but not the Goals\u201d.\n \n\u201cBody has it\u2019s limitations but mind doesn\u2019t \u201c\n \nYour Help is Needed :\n \nI'm just trying to express my experiences to get some assistance from the Quora community,if possible.\n \nI would love to welcome your suggestions or advices or help or criticism in any way.\n \nI may not be the perfect guy to answer you but I can feel and express my opinion by stepping into your shoes in a perfect way.\n \nI\u2019m not giving up rather I\u2019m challenging myself to get what I want. I\u2019ll persist until I succeed. For me, the true happiness always lies in Fighting.\n \nDisclaimer:\n \nAll these are based on my personal experiences only.\n \nI\u2019m not promoting or marketing myself as a good person\n \nAbsolutely, I can openly say 97.75% I\u2019m not a good guy\n \nI\u2019m not a perfect guy, I\u2019ll never. My Life is always under construction with your help, mostly with your criticism.\n \nI may not be the perfect guy to answer you or advice you but I can feel and express my feelings by stepping into your shoes in a perfect way in my own way. Please do correct me if I\u2019m wrong because I\u2019m not perfect. I\u2019d love to welcome your criticism rather appreciations because it really helps to move forward with Growth and Development in every aspect of my Life.\n \nNow, I\u2019m running and looking forward to find some investment and cofounder as well for my Brand Boss Media, an Influencer marketing agency.\n \n#Never Give Up#\n \n#Stay Hungry, Stay Crazy#\n \nThanks For Being Awesome With Your Thoughts And Wisdom With Words,\n \nSURESH MADHA !!!"

In some cases, people may have limited access to the internet due to economic constraints.\n \nTherefore, it's entirely possible to find individuals from diverse economic backgrounds on platforms like Quora. People's participation on the internet is not solely determined by the cost of access; other factors like education, language proficiency, and awareness of online platforms also play a role in shaping internet usage patterns.\n \nQuora, like other online platforms, aims to be a space where people from various backgrounds and experiences can ask questions, share knowledge, and engage in discussions, fostering a sense of inclusivity and diversity.

And when its not free, they know how to get grant money, charitable money. They know which churches offer what freebies, which charities are giving things away. They spend much of their time applying for freebies or waiting in line for freebies. They live as well if not better than most middle class working folks. It's time to take an honest look at poverty- at least in this country."
