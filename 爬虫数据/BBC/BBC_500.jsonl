Yoon, 64, is being investigated on charges of insurrection for a failed martial law order on 3 December that plunged the country into turmoil. He has also been impeached by parliament and suspended - but will only be removed from office if the Constitutional Court upholds the impeachment. However, Yoon's dramatic arrest on Wednesday brings to an end a weeks-long standoff between investigators and his presidential security team. Investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) failed to arrest him on 3 January after being locked in a six-hour stand-off with his security detail. But just before dawn on Wednesday, a much larger team of investigators and police arrived at his residence in central Seoul, armed with ladders to climb over buses blocking its entrance and bolt cutters to remove barbed wire. Other officers in the arrest team, which numbered around 1,000, scaled walls and hiked up nearby trails to reach the presidential residence. After several hours, authorities announced that Yoon had been arrested. In a three-minute video released just before his arrest, the 64-year-old leader said he would co-operate with the investigators, while repeating previous claims that the warrant was not legally valid. \"I decided to appear before the CIO, even though it is an illegal investigation, in order to prevent any unsavoury bloodshed,\" he said, adding that he witnessed officials \"invade\" his home's security perimeter with fire equipment. On Wednesday afternoon, investigators said Yoon had remained silent throughout questioning. Yoon's lawyers have said his arrest was \"illegal\" because the CIO, as an anti-corruption agency, has no power to investigate the insurrection allegations against Yoon. They also claim the warrant was issued by the wrong jurisdiction. The same court later dismissed an injunction filed by President Yoon to invalidate the arrest warrant, which the authorities maintain is lawful. The opposition Democratic Party's floor leader, Park Chan-dae, said Wednesday's arrest showed that \"justice in South Korea is alive\". This arrest \"is the first step toward restoring constitutional order, democracy and the rule of law\", he said during a party meeting. The country is currently being led by Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok as acting president. He was thrust into power after the first acting president,Han Duck-soo, was also impeachedby parliament, where the opposition has a sizeable majority. The clock has started ticking for investigators. Under the current warrant, they can hold Yoon for up to 48 hours from the point of arrest, after which they need a new warrant to detain him while he continues to be investigated. If that warrant is granted, they can detain him for up to 20 days before he is brought to trial. Without a new warrant, Yoon must be released."}

This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow whenKabul fell to the Taliban. Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns. Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban government expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\". Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports. How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me. \"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says. Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security. China, for example, has gone far: it has actively engaged with the Taliban government, focusing on security and economic interests, and even hasan ambassadorin the country. No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, but up to 40 countries maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with it. That's why experts like Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, are more circumspect about India's outreach. For the past three years, he says, India has maintained contact with the Taliban through a foreign service diplomat. India had closed its consulates in Afghanistan during the civil war in the 1990s and reopened them in 2002 after the war ended. \"We didn't want this hiatus to develop [again], so we wanted to engage. It is very simply a step up in relations,\" he says. India has\"historical and civilisational ties\" with Afghanistan, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament in 2023. India has invested more than $3bn (£2.46bn) in over 500 projects across Afghanistan, including roads, power lines, dams, hospitals and clinics. It has trained Afghan officers, awarded thousands of scholarships to students and built a new parliament building. This reflects a lasting geopolitical reality."}
{"Article Number": 40, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79dz14d30ro", "Text": "Calling people obese is medically \"flawed\" - and the definition should be split into two,a report from global expertssays. The term \"clinical obesity\" should be used for patients with a medical condition caused by their weight, while \"pre-clinically obese\" should be applied to those remaining fat but fit although at risk of disease. And this is better for patients than relying only on body mass index (BMI) - which measures whether they are a healthy weight for their height - to determine obesity. More than a billion people are estimated to beliving with obesity worldwideand prescription weight-loss drugs are in high demand. The report, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, is supported by more than 50 medical experts around the world.  \"Some individuals with obesity can maintain normal organ function and overall health, even long term, whereas others display signs and symptoms of severe illness here and now,\" Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, who chaired the expert group, said. \"Obesity is a spectrum,\" he added. The current, blanket definition means too many people are being diagnosed as obese but not receiving the most appropriate care, the report says. Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as havinga BMI over 30- a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight. It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared. For example, if they are 70kg (about 11 stone) and 1.70m (about 5ft 7in): Find out what your body mass index (BMI) means on the NHS website But BMI has limitations. It measures whether someone is carrying too much weight - but not too much fat. So very muscular people, such as athletes, tend to have a high BMI but not much fat. The report says BMI is useful on a large scale, to work out the proportion of a population who are a healthy weight, overweight or obese. But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs. Measuring a patient's waists or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says. \"Obesity is a health risk - the difference is it's also an illness for some,\" Prof Rubino said. Clinically obese When obesity is a disease, there will be signs of it affecting organs in the body - through heart disease, breathlessness, type 2 diabetes or joint pain - and a person's day-to-day activities. Treatment with drugs or surgery is likely. Pre-clinically obese When obesity is a risk to health - but not yet causing any illnesses, people should be offered weight-loss advice, counselling and monitoring, to reduce the chances of health problems developing. Doctors should also pay close attention to a patient's family history to see if they are at risk of particular diseases."}

{"Article Number": 42, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp5xe1zwgo", "Text": "Just before dawn on Wednesday, 3,000 police officers arrived at the heavily-fortified residence of South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol. Their mission: to arrest him. Investigators used ladders to scale over buses and bolt cutters to get through barbed wire as they broke through multiple blockades designed to stop them. Others hiked up nearby trails to reach the presidential residence. Hours later, they took him into custody for questioning over an alleged act of insurrection. This was their second attempt. Their first, which took place earlier this month, had seen some 150 officers face a six-hour deadlock with the president's security detail. They were helplessly outnumbered, first by the large number of pro-Yoon supporters who had gathered outside his residence to stop the police, and then by a human wall of security officers inside the property. Eventually, investigators concluded that it was \"practically impossible\" to arrest him - and left. Many now see Yoon as a disgraced leader - impeached and suspended from his presidential duties for trying to impose martial law, while heawaits the decision of the Constitutional Court, which can remove him from office. So why has it been so difficult to arrest him? It has been an unprecedented few weeks for South Korea since Yoon's shocking yet short-lived martial law order on 3 December. Lawmakers voted to impeach him, then came a criminal investigation and his refusal to appear for questioning, which was what sparked the arrest warrant. One key roadblock for the arresting officers had been Yoon's presidential security team, which on 3 January had formed a human wall and used vehicles to block the officers' path. Analysts said they could have acted out of loyalty to Yoon, pointing to the fact that Yoon himself had appointed several leaders of the Presidential Security Service (PSS). \"It may well be the case that Yoon has seeded the organisation with hardline loyalists in preparation for precisely this eventuality,\" says US-based lawyer and Korea expert Christopher Jumin Lee. It is unclear why they reportedly put up less resistance this time, though Mr Lee believes the team may have been partly deterred by the \"overwhelming show of force by the police\". \"At the end of the day I think they were simply unwilling to engage in the sort of large-scale violence against law enforcement officers that a full-throated defence of Yoon would have demanded,\" he said. Earlier this week, the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) had warned the PSS that they risked losing their pensions and their civil servant status for obstructing the arrest. In contrast, it reassured those who \"defy illegal orders\" to block the arrest that they \"will not face disadvantages\". On Wednesday, Yonhap news agency reported that a number of PSS members were either on leave or had chosen to stay inside the residence. The right-wing leader also has a strong support base. Some of Yoon's supporters had earlier told the BBC that they wereprepared to die to protect himand  repeated unfounded allegations that Yoon himself has floated, including that the country had been infiltrated by pro-North Korea forces."}

Forecasters have again identified an area of \"extreme fire danger\", emphasising the risk level in a region to the north-west of the city centre. In some mountainous areas, it is possible for winds to reach speeds of 70mph (113km/h), which would be nearly hurricane-force if they are sustained. The anticipated increase in speeds threatens to spread the remaining four blazes, which firefighters have made further progress in tackling during a few days of calmer conditions. Wind speeds began a slow and steady climb on Wednesday morning in parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. They are expected to peak during the day on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Compared with last week's conditions, winds are \"weaker but still strong\", the NWS cautions. There are hopes of another drop over the subsequent days - but officials have highlighted the need for rain that would help fire crews in their battle. \"The anticipated winds combined with low humidities and low fuel moistures will keep the fire threat in the LA region critical,\" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said during a news conference on Tuesday. Areas to the north-west of Los Angeles - including Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks - have been deemed to be particularly dangerous. An improvement in conditions is forecast later on Thursday and into Friday, says BBC Weather forecaster Sarah Keith-Lucas. But no rainfall is forecast for at least the next week - and the Santa Ana winds that have been blamed for stoking the blazes could again develop from Sunday. The fire chief for the city of Pasadena echoed the need for precipitation. There had been no \"real rain in southern California\" for more than 250 days, Chad Augustin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. His firefighters would spent Wednesday on \"standing guard ready to ensure that we hold our containment lines and we don't burn up any more structures\", Mr Augustin added. An extreme weather attribution study from climate scientists at 'Climameter' has concluded that the Californian wildfires have been fuelled by meteorological conditions strengthened by human-induced climate change. The study found that current conditions have been up to 41F (5C) warmer, 15% drier and 20% windier compared to the past, in the areas affected by the fires. The 25th death from the fires was confirmed by the LA County Medical Examiner's Office. Thirteen other people remain missing. Most of the victims have died in the Eaton Fire, which has burned more than 14,000 acres to the city's north, but has now been 35% contained by firefighters. Further west, the larger Palisades Fire has torched more than 23,000 acres, and is now at 18% containment. Two smaller fires also continue to burn. Some of the victims of the Eaton Fire have now been allowed to return to their homes, although officials say they have no firm date for repopulation of the Palisades area, an upmarket area ravaged by the fire to which it lent its name."}

There were reports of a breakthrough on Wednesday, with unnamed Israeli officials cited as saying that Hamas had agreed to the latest draft presented by Qatari, US and Egyptian mediators. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office however swiftly denied the reports. There was also no immediate comment from the Palestinian armed group. On Tuesday night, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said they were \"on the brink\" of an agreement and awaiting \"final word from Hamas\". A senior Hamas official later told Reuters news agency it had not delivered its official response to the draft because Israel had yet to submit maps showing how its troops would withdraw from areas of Gaza. However, Israel's Haaretz newspaper cited an Israeli source as denying Hamas's claim about the maps. The proposed three-phase deal would begin with an initial six-week ceasefire. A Palestinian official told the BBC that Hamas would release three hostages on the first day of a deal, after which Israel would begin withdrawing troops from populated areas. More hostage releases would then be staggered over the following weeks, he said, with Israel allowing displaced residents to return in northern areas. Israel has said it expects 33 hostages to be released in the first phase and that it will free a yet to be determined number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails in return. Negotiations for the second phase - which should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli troop withdrawal and a \"sustainable calm\" - would start after two weeks. Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman said on Tuesday that there were no major issues were blocking a deal and that he was hopeful the talks would \"very soon lead to an agreement\". However, he also warned that that \"the most minor detail\" could yet undermine the process. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 46,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of the 2.3 million population has also been displaced, there is widespread destruction, and there are severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter due to an struggle to get aid to those in need. Israel says 94 of the hostages are still being held by Hamas, of whom 34 are presumed dead. In addition, there are four Israelis who were abducted before the war, two of whom are dead. Relatives of the remaining hostages have urged the Israeli government to do whatever it takes to get a deal over the line and bring all of them home. \"We can't miss this moment. This is the last moment; we can save them,\" said Hadas Kalderon, the wife of Ofer Kalderon, a 54-year-old. Palestinians also dared to hope that an end to the devastating 15-month war was close."}

They say the man also tried to get them to sign waivers which stated they did not accuse anyone of \"criminal wrongdoing\". The 11 survivors who have spoken to the BBC have also accused the Egyptian authorities of trying to cover up what happened, saying investigators were determined to blame it on a huge wave. The Sea Story had been carrying 46 people when it sank in the early hours of 25 November last year - four bodies were recovered and seven people are still missing, including two British divers. Neither the Egyptian government nor the boat operators - Dive Pro Liveaboard, based in Hurghada - have responded to our questions. On Tuesday,the BBC revealed multiple accusations from survivors of safety failingson board the vessel. A leading oceanographer who analysed weather data also said it was not plausible that a huge wave had hit the vessel. Within hours of being brought ashore, survivors say they were subjected to what one described as \"an interrogation\", some from their hospital beds, by people they were told were judges. Those who didn't need hospital treatment were interviewed at a nearby resort, said other survivors, who reported the same feelings of being pressured. \"We were told we couldn't leave the room until they'd done everybody's statements,\" says Sarah Martin, an NHS doctor from Lancashire. The judges were part of an Egyptian investigation into what caused the sinking - though survivors say it was not clear exactly who was leading it. The survivors say having their initial statements translated into Arabic by an employee of the company that owned the Sea Story was a clear conflict of interest. Spanish diver Hissora Gonzalez said the man did not initially introduce himself as an employee. \"He just said, 'You have to tell me what happened, and then you have to sign this piece of paper.'\" It was not until later, say several people we spoke to, that the man told them he worked for Dive Pro Liveaboard. The survivors say that, after being translated by the man, their statements were handed to investigators - something that shocked Lisa Wolf. \"A normal judge can't take a translation from someone that's obviously totally involved in the process.\" One survivor, who is a Norwegian police investigator, said she had \"no clue\" what the four pages of Arabic handed back to her actually said. \"They could have written anything. I don't know what I signed,\" Frøydis Adamson explained. Under her signature she says she wrote that she had not been able to read the documents. \"We were in such shock and just wanted to go home,\" said Hissora.

She had referred herself to the prime minister's standards adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, after questions about links to her aunt, who was ousted last year as Bangladesh's prime minister. Sir Laurie said he had \"not identified evidence of improprieties\" but it was \"regrettable\" that Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of the ties to her aunt. Siddiq said continuing in her role would be \"a distraction\" for the government but insisted she had done nothing wrong. Before her resignation was announced, Siddiq had been named in a second investigation in Bangladesh. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said the prime minister \"dithered and delayed to protect\" her. Writing on X, she said: \"It was clear at the weekend that the anti-corruption minister's position was completely untenable. Yet Keir Starmer dithered and delayed to protect his close friend. \"Even now, as Bangladesh files a criminal case against Tulip Siddiq, he expresses 'sadness' at her inevitable resignation. \"Weak leadership from a weak prime minister.\" In a letter accepting Siddiq's resignation, Sir Keir said the \"door remains open\" for her. Siddiq, whose role as Economic Secretary to the Treasuryincluded tackling corruption in UK financial markets,was named last month in an investigation into claims her family embezzled up to £3.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh. Her aunt is the former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, head of the Awami League, who fled into exile after being deposed last year. Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, also came under intense scrutiny over her use of properties in London linked to her aunt's allies. TheFinancial Times reportedthat one of the properties, a flat in King's Cross, had been given to her by a person connected with the recently ousted Bangladeshi government. According to the Mail on Sunday, in 2022 Siddiq had denied the flat was a gift and insisted her parents had bought it for her and had threatened the paper with legal action preventing publication of a story. Labour sources subsequently told the newspaper the flat had been gifted to Siddiq by a property developer with alleged links to her aunt. Sir Laurie spent eight days investigating the allegations after Siddiq referred herself to the standards watchdog. In his letter, Sir Laurie said Siddiq \"acknowledges that, over an extended period, she was unaware of the origins of her ownership of her flat in Kings Cross, despite having signed a Land Registry transfer form relating to the gift at the time\". He said the MP \"remained under the impression that her parents had given the flat to her, having purchased it from the previous owner\". This had led to the public being \"inadvertently misled\" about the identity of the donor of the flat, added Sir Laurie. Sir Laurie said this was an \"unfortunate misunderstanding\" which had led to Siddiq issuing a public correction of \"the origins of her ownership after she became a minister\"."}

The film, about a Hungarian architect who is hired by a wealthy American after World War Two, has nine nods in total and is also tipped to be a big contender at the Oscars. The Substance director Coralie Fargeat is another first-time directing nominee and is the only female nominated in the category. Demi Moore is nominated for best actress for the film, weeks after winning at the Golden Globes - putting her in a strong position for the Oscars. Conclave's Edward Berger is also nominated for best director, and thanked the \"wonderful crew\" who helped the film earn 12 nominations. He had found \"a team of like-minded people who bond together to strive for the unattainable goal - perfection\", he said. British actress Marianne Jean-Baptiste's nomination in the same category for playing an irritable woman struggling with depression in Hard Truths has boosted momentum for her to receive an Oscar nomination. The Bafta shortlist is often a strong indicator for the Oscars, and last year the winners of the top six categories matched perfectly at the two ceremonies. Another Oscar-tipped film is A Complete Unknown, which follows Bob Dylan's rise to fame in the 1960s."}
{"Article Number": 49, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2jld7j50eo", "Text": "The area in Gaza which Israel's military has told people to go to \"for their safety\" has been hit by 97 strikes since May, BBC Verify analysis has revealed. The findings come as negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appear to be nearing a breakthrough. Mediators in Qatar say talks are in their final stages, raising hopes that an agreement could be reached soon. The \"humanitarian zone\" was first established by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in October 2023 toprotect civilians and keep them out of harms way. On 6 May 2024, the IDF significantly expanded the zone to include the cities of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah. The area - much of which is a strip of land along the Mediterranean sea - is densely populated and is estimated to have over a million people living there according to international humanitarian organisations. Many people are living in tents, with limited infrastructure and limited access to aid. Local media reports indicate more than 550 people have been killed in the 97 strikes mapped by BBC Verify. In a statement to BBC Verify, the IDF said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating in the \"humanitarian zone\" and accused the group of violating international law while \"exploiting\" civilians as human shields and launching rockets from the area. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's 7 October 2023 attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. The conflict has caused widespread damage to infrastructure across Gaza, with satellite images showing areas flattened by Israeli strikes. The Hamas-run health ministry also says more than 46,600 people have been killed within the enclave since the start of the war. BBC Verify analysis suggests that attacks within the \"humanitarian zone\" have intensified since May 2024, with at least 22 strikes already recorded so far this month. We also cannot confirm that all incidents are the result of IDF attacks. Locations of strikes documented by BBC Verify were provided to the IDF but they did not confirm or deny their involvement. Israeli military officials have only publicly acknowledged 28 attacks since 6 May. Israel historically has not publicly acknowledged every strike it has carried out in Gaza. Gavin Kelleher, an access manager in Gaza for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said there were \"near daily\" strikes within the zone, including from Israeli ships and quadcopters, or small drones. He added that \"heavy fire is recurrent in this area despite its [Israel's] unilateral 'humanitarian' designation.\" \"The Israeli military appears keen to maintain the illusion of a Humanitarian Zone that remains a certain size, yet that zone can be subject to 'evacuation orders' at any time and be targeted,\" Mr Kelleher said. One resident who lives within the zone, Khaled Abdel Rahman, told the BBC that residents were being subjected to daily bombardments, frequently resulting in injuries and casualties. \"We were displaced to Khan Younis because it was designated as a safe zone, but in fact we find nothing here but insecurity,\" Mr Rahman said."}

Photos of him and stories of people who have met him are incredibly rare. But now a man who got the secretive artist to work with children at a youth club in the late 1990s has given the BBC an exclusive insight into the man behind the murals, just as he was about to become famous. Banksy is one of the world's most famous graffiti artists. His work has sold for millions of pounds and his exhibitions seen by hundreds of thousands of people. But behind layers of paint, lost in time at a Bristol youth club, there's a Banksy very few people know about. On the cusp of international fame, the artist was leaving his mark - not only on the streets of his city, but on young people in Lawrence Weston. Here, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural. \"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building. \"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\" Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous. The artist would return to the club several times to create new works, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds – oblivious to who the artist would eventually become. It was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol. His friend had a suggestion – someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself. That person was Banksy. \"I got his phone number, so I used to call him up and ask if he'd come and do some art projects. He was really keen,\" Peter said. This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police. Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids. The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub. \"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society. \"It was always very vibrant.\" Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \"nobody thought twice about who he was\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston. He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said. \"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego. He was doing art with them, rather than doing art for them,\" he said. \"In the morning, he sat around a table with the children, talking about their ideas."}

Inauguration day includes a formal swearing-in ceremony as well as musical performances, a celebratory parade and a number of formal balls. Vice-President-elect JD Vance will also take the oath of office, joining Trump on stage to officially begin their new administration. The inauguration is the formal ceremony that marks the end of one president's time in office and the start of their successor's administration. It is the most high-profile part of the transition of power between government leaders in Washington DC. A key part of the ceremony includes the president-elect reciting the oath of office: \"I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" Though he won the election in November, Trump officially becomes the 47th president once he says those words. He previously served as the 45th president between 2017 and 2021. Vance will also take an oath of office before he formally assumes the position of vice-president. Trump's second inauguration day will kick off with a service at St. John's Church, Lafayette Square, a historic Washington DC church, followed by tea at the White House. Musical performances and opening remarks are set to begin on the main event stage - located on the West Lawn of the US Capitol building - at 09:30 EST (14:30 GMT). That will be followed by the swearing-in of Trump and Vance as well as the inaugural address in which the president will set out his goals for the next four years. Trump will then head inside to the President's Room - near the Senate chamber - to sign key documents. He will then attend a lunch hosted by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. This is followed by a parade which goes from the Capitol building down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Later in the evening, Trump will appear at three inaugural balls throughout the city - the Commander-in-Chief Ball, the Liberty Inaugural Ball and the Starlight Ball. He is expected to speak at all three. There is typically high demand to watch the inauguration in person, and tickets are highly sought after. Members of Congress receive a certain number of tickets to the ceremony, which they can distribute to their constituents. These tickets are free, but often challenging to get. Americans can contact their congressperson directly for tickets. If you're not able to attend in person, there are plenty of ways to watch remotely. The White House will livestream the inauguration. The BBC will carry inauguration coverage live on our news channel. You can also watch a stream of the inauguration on our website and follow our live page, where we'll bring you updates, analysis and key moments as they happen. Local and federal officials are expecting around 200,000 people to show up in Washington DC, which could include Trump supporters and protestors."}
{"Article Number": 52, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyng762q4eo", "Text": "TikTok will be banned in the US on 19 January - unless the Supreme Court accepts alast ditch legal bid fromits Chinese owner, ByteDance, that to do so would be unconstitutional. But even if the country's highest judicial authority agrees with the lower courts - and Congress - that the platform is a threat to national security will that actually stop Americans using it? Will there be ways to bypass the ban - or could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop a law he says he opposed to, even if the courts uphold it. And whatever happens to TikTok, who stands to benefit from the uncertainty clouding its future? The most likely way the US would ban TikTok is to order app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, to make it unavailable for download in that region. US lawmakers have already told  tech firms to be ready to remove the app from their stores if a ban comes into force. That would mean people could no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok - though it would also mean people who've already got it would still have it on their phones. Because the app would not be publicly available anymore, new updates could no longer be delivered to users in the US - which would make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable. Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target. Of course, there are ways around such a ban. There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region. The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements. It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks. However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app. So if the ban took this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to. There are still other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether. And even if people did use a VPN, there are still ways TikTok could theoretically judge whether a person is based in the US - and then simply present them with a screen saying the app is not available in their country. It remains to be seen whether TikTok would decide to assist the government in its own ban - but it is being reported by Reuters that it plans to do so. TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US unless it rules in its favour."}

This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow whenKabul fell to the Taliban. Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns. Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban government expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\". Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports. How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me. \"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says. Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security. China, for example, has gone far: it has actively engaged with the Taliban government, focusing on security and economic interests, and even hasan ambassadorin the country. No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, but up to 40 countries maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with it. That's why experts like Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, are more circumspect about India's outreach. For the past three years, he says, India has maintained contact with the Taliban through a foreign service diplomat. India had closed its consulates in Afghanistan during the civil war in the 1990s and reopened them in 2002 after the war ended. \"We didn't want this hiatus to develop [again], so we wanted to engage. It is very simply a step up in relations,\" he says. India has\"historical and civilisational ties\" with Afghanistan, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament in 2023. India has invested more than $3bn (£2.46bn) in over 500 projects across Afghanistan, including roads, power lines, dams, hospitals and clinics. It has trained Afghan officers, awarded thousands of scholarships to students and built a new parliament building. This reflects a lasting geopolitical reality."}

In a memo to staff, boss Mark Zuckerberg said he had made the decision to speed up the firm's regular performance-based cuts in anticipation of an \"intense year\". He said the company would \"backfill\" the roles later in 2025. The company, which employs about 72,000 people globally, did not say how the cuts would be distributed around the world. Workers in the US who are affected will know by 10 February, according to Mr Zuckerberg's memo. Those outside the US will be informed \"later\". \"This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams,\" he wrote. \"I've decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster.\" The move comes on the heels of other big decisions by Mr Zuckerberg, including moves to end the company's fact-checking and diversity programmes. Performance-based job cuts are common in corporate America. At Meta, they would normally unfold over the course of a year, Mr Zuckerberg said, but the process is being accelerated this year. Roughly 3,600 people could be affected this move. They will receive \"generous severance\", he said. The last big cuts at Meta came in 2023, when the companycut about 10,000 positionsin a cost-cutting drive after Mr Zuckerberg declared it the \"year of efficiency\". Itcut about 11,000 roles in 2022. Mr Zuckerberg also appears to be overhauling his own public image. On a recent podcast with Joe Rogan, Mr Zuckerberg said he thought companies needed more \"masculine energy\" and discussed taking up martial arts, which he said he enjoyed because he felt he could more fully express himself, than in his corporate role. \"When you're running a company, people typically don't wanna see you being like this ruthless person who's just like I'm gonna crush the people I'm competing with,\" he said. \"But when you're fighting, it's like no.\" \"I think in some ways when people see me competing in the sport they're like oh no, 'That's the real Mark.\" In an exclusive interview, Ian Russell tells the BBC that he believes there is \"no real movement\" within government on online safety. The companies are among the latest major corporations to alter their diversity programmes since Trump's re-election. The US companies join other major firms donating funds for the ceremony on 20 January. Users will no longer be able to opt out of political content from people they do not follow. Meta says its platforms will instead rely on \"community notes\" from its users, an approach pioneered by X. Copyright 2025 BBC.

The sheet music was kept at his family's music production company - which burnt down in the Pacific Palisades neighbourhood last week. While no original manuscripts were lost, the music owned by Belmont Music Publishing had been the main collection of scores rented out to orchestras and musicians. The director of the American Symphony Orchestra, Leon Botstein, said these had been an \"indispensable resource\" for performing musicians. Schoenberg's son, Larry, 83, said the sheet music had been kept in a building behind his house. Both buildings were razed in the fires last week. Other Schoenberg memorabilia was also destroyed, including photographs, letters and posters. \"For a company that focused exclusively on the works of Schoenberg, this loss represents not just a physical destruction of property but a profound cultural blow,\" said Larry in a statement. He described the collection as \"essential\" for musicians who rely on the \"meticulously curated editions\" of his father's back catalogue. Arnold Schoenberg was born into a Jewish family in Vienna in 1874. He went on to find huge success as a composer in Berlin before fleeing to the US in 1933 to avoid persecution from the Nazis. He eventually settled in Los Angeles where he continued his groundbreaking compositions. He was known for atonality and his 12-tones technique which departed from conventional harmonies. He died in 1951 at the age of 76 in Los Angeles. In a statement Belmont said it was hoping to create digital copies of the scores. \"We hope that in the near future we will be able to 'rise from the ashes' in a completely digital form,\" the statement said. Most of Schoenberg's original manuscripts are held at a museum in Vienna, Austria. Firefighters are still battling to control the huge wildfires in Los Angeles which began in early January. So far they have killed at least 24 people, destroyed thousands of buildings and forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes.

{"Article Number": 64, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7en1452xjo", "Text": "Mozambique's new President Daniel Chapo has been sworn in at a low-key ceremony in the capital, Maputo, that was marred by an opposition boycott following heavily disputed elections. Most businesses in Maputo were shut and the streets largely deserted after defeated presidential candidate Venâncio Mondlane called for a national strike in protest. In his first presidential address, Chapo, 47, pledged to \"devote all my energies\" to promoting unity and human rights in a nation scarred by post-election violence. A local civil society group says that more than 300 people have been killed in clashes with security forces since elections in October. Chapo won with 65% of the vote, extending the 49-year-rule of the Frelimo party. Mondlane - who contested the election as an independent - came second with 24% of the vote. He rejected the result, saying it was rigged and called for a strike on inauguration day \"against the thieves of the people\". Addressing about 2,500 guests at the heavily guarded ceremony, Chapo said that \"together, we will restore patriotism and pride in being Mozambican\". \"Mozambique cannot remain a hostage to corruption, nepotism, and incompetence,\" he added. Police fired shots to disperse crowds outside Independence Square, where the ceremony was held, as Chapo's motorcade left afterwards. The crowds were mostly of Mondlane's supporters, but they included some who backed Chapo. Both groups had earlier tried to enter the venue but were barred from doing so. \"Is this a wedding with private invitations? We want to see the president being sworn in but we have been told we can't,\" Maputo resident Paulu Hamuze told the BBC. Mondlane's electoral campaign was backed by a small opposition party, which heeded his call for a boycott of the inauguration. Both of Mozambique's leading opposition parties – Renamo and MDM –  also boycotted the swearing-in because they also do not recognise Chapo as the rightful winner. Chapo succeeds Filipe Nyusi, who has stepped down at the end of his two terms. Even those in Mozambique who wish Chapo well openly question his legitimacy, or whether he will be able to tackle the problems he has identified. \"Chapo is someone I admire greatly,\" civil society activist Mirna Chitsungo tells the BBC. \"I worked with him for four years - I am familiar with his willingness to act, his openness to dialogue, and his readiness to follow recommendations from civil society on the ground.\" \"However, he is assuming an illegitimate power. This stems from a fraudulent electoral process... He is taking power in a context where the people do not accept him.\" In addition to winning over a hostile public, Chapo will also have to deliver the economic turnaround and halt to corruption that he promised on the campaign trail. \"Chapo will face many enemies because it looks like Mozambique is run by cartels, including cartels of books, cartel of medicines, cartel of sugar, cartel of drugs, cartel of kidnappings, mafia groups,\" says analyst and investigative journalist Luis Nhanchote."}

{"Article Number": 66, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyv433le3vno", "Text": "Drake has scrapped a legal case against Universal Music and Spotify, in which he accused the companies of conspiring to boost the streams of Kendrick Lamar's diss track against him, Not Like Us. The Canadian startook action last November, alleging that the music companies had used bots, payola and other methods to promote Lamar's song, which accused him of paedophilia. \"The record-shattering spread of Not Like Us on streaming, sales, and radio play was deliberate and appears to have relied upon irregular and inappropriate business practices,\" court documents alleged. However, on Tuesday, Drake's lawyers voluntarily withdrew a pre-action filing, effectively ending the case. According to court documents filed in New York, the star met with representatives of Spotify and Universal on Tuesday to discuss the case. Spotify, which had filed an opposition, had no objection to the withdrawal and discontinuance. Universal, which hadn't filed an opposition, reserved its position. A related case, filed against Universal and radio network iHeartRadio in Texas, is still active.  Not Like Us was widely regarded as the decisive blow in a long-running feud between Drake and Lamar, which dates back to the early 2010s. In the lyrics, Lamar alleges that Drake \"likes 'em young\" and accuses him of using other, more credible rappers, to boost his profile. Around 24 hours later, Drake responded with a track called The Heart Part 6, where he rejected the allegations, saying, \"I never been with no one under age\". He also  claimed to have fed Lamar \"false\" information through a double agent. However, his retort failed to attract the same attention as Not Like Us, which debuted at number one in the US chart and attracted more than 1 billion streams on Spotify. Taking to the courts, Drake accused Universal - which distributes both his music and Lamar's - of artificially boosting the song's numbers. In court documents, he claimed that the label licensed the song \"at drastically reduced rates to Spotify\" and used bots to stream the song, generating \"the false impression that the song was more popular than it was in reality\".  The papers were not a lawsuit, but a \"pre-action petition\", in which Drake's lawyers sought to gain access to internal documents at Spotify and Universal which might have supported their case. In a statement at the time, Universal told the BBC: \"The suggestion that [the company] would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue. \"We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns. No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\" Spotify also responded that there was \"no economic incentive for users to stream Not Like Us over any of Drake's tracks\". The Swedish streaming company later filed an opposition brief to Drake's petition, stating that it \"should be denied\". Music industry experts had been sceptical that the accusations would ever reach trial."}

Public Service Cabinet Secretary Justin Muturi said that it took a call by President William Ruto to have his son released by the National Intelligence Service (NIS). Muturi is the first member of the cabinet to publicly criticise the government's handling of the spate of abductions in Kenya. In a statement to the police crime investigations unit on Tuesday, Muturi gave a detailed account of how his son, Leslie, was abducted on 22 June last year. Mr Ruto and the intelligence agency have not commented on his allegations. At least 80 people, including the minister's son, have been abducted in the last six months, according to a state-funded rights group. The wave of abductions started after protests against tax hikes last June, and have continued since then. Some of those abducted have been released following public pressure. Earlier this week, the minister told journalists that he had not received answers about the abduction of his son, despite reaching out to top security officials. Muturi said the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) subsequently urged him to record a statement with them, telling him the matter was still under investigation. In his statement to the DCI, Muturi recalled calling the inspector-general of police, the interior minister, the DCI head, the head of the intelligence agency and other top officials as he desperately looked for his son – but, he added, all were unable to help. He said that he also messaged Ruto, but later decided to visit his official residence to raise the matter directly with him. \"I then narrated the ordeal [to the president] including my interactions with various senior government officials who had been unable to help. I expressed my belief that NIS was holding my son,\" Muturi said in the statement. He said that the president made a joke about the issue and then made a call to the head of the intelligence agency, who promised to release his son in a hour. \"I heard the president ask [NIS director] Noordin Haji if he was holding my son. [He] confirmed that indeed he was holding my son and the president instructed him to release Leslie immediately,\" Muturi added. Muturi has faced calls from some government-allied politicians to resign for publicly criticising the government in which he serves. Foreign nationals have also been abducted, including prominent Tanzanian activist Maria Sarungi Tsehai, who on Monday narrated how she was kidnapped by armed men and released several hours later. Last year, Ugandan opposition leader Kizza Besigye was kidnapped in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, allegedly by Ugandan security officials, and taken across the border for trial by a court martial.

{"Article Number": 69, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg45zqz225vo", "Text": "Yoon Suk Yeol has become South Korea's first sitting president to be arrested after investigators scaled barricades and cut through barbed wire to take him into custody. Yoon, 64, is being investigated on charges of insurrection for a failed martial law order on 3 December that plunged the country into turmoil. He has also been impeached by parliament and suspended - but will only be removed from office if the Constitutional Court upholds the impeachment. However, Yoon's dramatic arrest on Wednesday brings to an end a weeks-long standoff between investigators and his presidential security team. Investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) failed to arrest him on 3 January after being locked in a six-hour stand-off with his security detail. But just before dawn on Wednesday, a much larger team of investigators and police arrived at his residence in central Seoul, armed with ladders to climb over buses blocking its entrance and bolt cutters to remove barbed wire. Other officers in the arrest team, which numbered around 1,000, scaled walls and hiked up nearby trails to reach the presidential residence. After several hours, authorities announced that Yoon had been arrested. In a three-minute video released just before his arrest, the 64-year-old leader said he would co-operate with the investigators, while repeating previous claims that the warrant was not legally valid. \"I decided to appear before the CIO, even though it is an illegal investigation, in order to prevent any unsavoury bloodshed,\" he said, adding that he witnessed officials \"invade\" his home's security perimeter with fire equipment. On Wednesday afternoon, investigators said Yoon had remained silent throughout questioning. Yoon's lawyers have said his arrest was \"illegal\" because the CIO, as an anti-corruption agency, has no power to investigate the insurrection allegations against Yoon. They also claim the warrant was issued by the wrong jurisdiction. The same court later dismissed an injunction filed by President Yoon to invalidate the arrest warrant, which the authorities maintain is lawful. The opposition Democratic Party's floor leader, Park Chan-dae, said Wednesday's arrest showed that \"justice in South Korea is alive\". This arrest \"is the first step toward restoring constitutional order, democracy and the rule of law\", he said during a party meeting. The country is currently being led by Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok as acting president. He was thrust into power after the first acting president,Han Duck-soo, was also impeachedby parliament, where the opposition has a sizeable majority. The clock has started ticking for investigators. Under the current warrant, they can hold Yoon for up to 48 hours from the point of arrest, after which they need a new warrant to detain him while he continues to be investigated. If that warrant is granted, they can detain him for up to 20 days before he is brought to trial. Without a new warrant, Yoon must be released."}

Forecasters have again identified an area of \"extreme fire danger\", emphasising the risk level in a region to the north-west of the city centre. In some mountainous areas, it is possible for winds to reach speeds of 70mph (113km/h), which would be nearly hurricane-force if they are sustained. The anticipated increase in speeds threatens to spread the remaining four blazes, which firefighters have made further progress in tackling during a few days of calmer conditions. Wind speeds began a slow and steady climb on Wednesday morning in parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. They are expected to peak during the day on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Compared with last week's conditions, winds are \"weaker but still strong\", the NWS cautions. There are hopes of another drop over the subsequent days - but officials have highlighted the need for rain that would help fire crews in their battle. \"The anticipated winds combined with low humidities and low fuel moistures will keep the fire threat in the LA region critical,\" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said during a news conference on Tuesday. Areas to the north-west of Los Angeles - including Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks - have been deemed to be particularly dangerous. An improvement in conditions is forecast later on Thursday and into Friday, says BBC Weather forecaster Sarah Keith-Lucas. But no rainfall is forecast for at least the next week - and the Santa Ana winds that have been blamed for stoking the blazes could again develop from Sunday. The fire chief for the city of Pasadena echoed the need for precipitation. There had been no \"real rain in southern California\" for more than 250 days, Chad Augustin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. His firefighters would spent Wednesday on \"standing guard ready to ensure that we hold our containment lines and we don't burn up any more structures\", Mr Augustin added. An extreme weather attribution study from climate scientists at 'Climameter' has concluded that the Californian wildfires have been fuelled by meteorological conditions strengthened by human-induced climate change. The study found that current conditions have been up to 41F (5C) warmer, 15% drier and 20% windier compared to the past, in the areas affected by the fires. The 25th death from the fires was confirmed by the LA County Medical Examiner's Office. Thirteen other people remain missing. Most of the victims have died in the Eaton Fire, which has burned more than 14,000 acres to the city's north, but has now been 35% contained by firefighters. Further west, the larger Palisades Fire has torched more than 23,000 acres, and is now at 18% containment. Two smaller fires also continue to burn. Some of the victims of the Eaton Fire have now been allowed to return to their homes, although officials say they have no firm date for repopulation of the Palisades area, an upmarket area ravaged by the fire to which it lent its name."}

This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow whenKabul fell to the Taliban. Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns. Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban government expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\". Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports. How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me. \"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says. Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security. China, for example, has gone far: it has actively engaged with the Taliban government, focusing on security and economic interests, and even hasan ambassadorin the country. No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, but up to 40 countries maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with it. That's why experts like Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, are more circumspect about India's outreach. For the past three years, he says, India has maintained contact with the Taliban through a foreign service diplomat. India had closed its consulates in Afghanistan during the civil war in the 1990s and reopened them in 2002 after the war ended. \"We didn't want this hiatus to develop [again], so we wanted to engage. It is very simply a step up in relations,\" he says. India has\"historical and civilisational ties\" with Afghanistan, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament in 2023. India has invested more than $3bn (£2.46bn) in over 500 projects across Afghanistan, including roads, power lines, dams, hospitals and clinics. It has trained Afghan officers, awarded thousands of scholarships to students and built a new parliament building. This reflects a lasting geopolitical reality."}

Their mission: to arrest him. Investigators used ladders to scale over buses and bolt cutters to get through barbed wire as they broke through multiple blockades designed to stop them. Others hiked up nearby trails to reach the presidential residence. Hours later, they took him into custody for questioning over an alleged act of insurrection. This was their second attempt. Their first, which took place earlier this month, had seen some 150 officers face a six-hour deadlock with the president's security detail. They were helplessly outnumbered, first by the large number of pro-Yoon supporters who had gathered outside his residence to stop the police, and then by a human wall of security officers inside the property. Eventually, investigators concluded that it was \"practically impossible\" to arrest him - and left. Many now see Yoon as a disgraced leader - impeached and suspended from his presidential duties for trying to impose martial law, while heawaits the decision of the Constitutional Court, which can remove him from office. So why has it been so difficult to arrest him? It has been an unprecedented few weeks for South Korea since Yoon's shocking yet short-lived martial law order on 3 December. Lawmakers voted to impeach him, then came a criminal investigation and his refusal to appear for questioning, which was what sparked the arrest warrant. One key roadblock for the arresting officers had been Yoon's presidential security team, which on 3 January had formed a human wall and used vehicles to block the officers' path. Analysts said they could have acted out of loyalty to Yoon, pointing to the fact that Yoon himself had appointed several leaders of the Presidential Security Service (PSS). \"It may well be the case that Yoon has seeded the organisation with hardline loyalists in preparation for precisely this eventuality,\" says US-based lawyer and Korea expert Christopher Jumin Lee. It is unclear why they reportedly put up less resistance this time, though Mr Lee believes the team may have been partly deterred by the \"overwhelming show of force by the police\". \"At the end of the day I think they were simply unwilling to engage in the sort of large-scale violence against law enforcement officers that a full-throated defence of Yoon would have demanded,\" he said. Earlier this week, the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) had warned the PSS that they risked losing their pensions and their civil servant status for obstructing the arrest. In contrast, it reassured those who \"defy illegal orders\" to block the arrest that they \"will not face disadvantages\". On Wednesday, Yonhap news agency reported that a number of PSS members were either on leave or had chosen to stay inside the residence. The right-wing leader also has a strong support base. Some of Yoon's supporters had earlier told the BBC that they wereprepared to die to protect himand  repeated unfounded allegations that Yoon himself has floated, including that the country had been infiltrated by pro-North Korea forces."}

The term \"clinical obesity\" should be used for patients with a medical condition caused by their weight, while \"pre-clinically obese\" should be applied to those remaining fat but fit, although at risk of disease. This is better for patients than relying only on body mass index (BMI) - which measures whether they are a healthy weight for their height - to determine obesity. More than a billion people are estimated to beliving with obesity worldwideand prescription weight-loss drugs are in high demand. The report, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, is supported by more than 50 medical experts around the world.  \"Some individuals with obesity can maintain normal organ function and overall health, even long term, whereas others display signs and symptoms of severe illness here and now,\" Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, who chaired the expert group, said. \"Obesity is a spectrum,\" he added. The current, blanket definition means too many people are being diagnosed as obese but not receiving the most appropriate care, the report says. Natalie, from Crewe, goes to the gym four times a week and has a healthy diet, but is still overweight. \"I would consider myself on the larger side, but I'm fit,\" she told the BBC 5 Live phone-in with Nicky Campbell. \"If you look at my BMI I'm obese, but if I speak to my doctor they say that I'm fit, healthy and there's nothing wrong with me. \"I'm doing everything I can to stay fit and have a long healthy life,\" she said. Richard, from Falmouth, said there is a lot of confusion around BMI. \"When they did my test, it took me to a level of borderline obesity, but my body fat was only 4.9% - the problem is I had a lot of muscle mass,\" he says. In Mike's opinion, you cannot be fat and fit - he says it is all down to diet. \"All these skinny jabs make me laugh, if you want to lose weight stop eating - it's easy.\" Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as havinga BMI over 30- a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight. It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared. For example, if they are 70kg (about 11 stone) and 1.70m (about 5ft 7in): Find out what your body mass index (BMI) means on the NHS website But BMI has limitations. It measures whether someone is carrying too much weight - but not too much fat. So very muscular people, such as athletes, tend to have a high BMI but not much fat. The report says BMI is useful on a large scale, to work out the proportion of a population who are a healthy weight, overweight or obese. But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs. Measuring a patient's waists or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says."}
{"Article Number": 74, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87dxx41lvvo", "Text": "Survivors of a deadly dive-boat sinking in the Red Sea say they were pressured to sign official witness statements in Arabic - which they couldn't understand and had been translated from English by an employee of the boat company. They say the man also tried to get them to sign waivers which stated they did not accuse anyone of \"criminal wrongdoing\". The 11 survivors who have spoken to the BBC have also accused the Egyptian authorities of trying to cover up what happened, saying investigators were determined to blame it on a huge wave. The Sea Story had been carrying 46 people when it sank in the early hours of 25 November last year - four bodies were recovered and seven people are still missing, including two British divers. Neither the Egyptian government nor the boat operators - Dive Pro Liveaboard, based in Hurghada - have responded to our questions. On Tuesday,the BBC revealed multiple accusations from survivors of safety failingson board the vessel. A leading oceanographer who analysed weather data also said it was not plausible that a huge wave had hit the vessel. Within hours of being brought ashore, survivors say they were subjected to what one described as \"an interrogation\", some from their hospital beds, by people they were told were judges. Those who didn't need hospital treatment were interviewed at a nearby resort, said other survivors, who reported the same feelings of being pressured. \"We were told we couldn't leave the room until they'd done everybody's statements,\" says Sarah Martin, an NHS doctor from Lancashire. The judges were part of an Egyptian investigation into what caused the sinking - though survivors say it was not clear exactly who was leading it. The survivors say having their initial statements translated into Arabic by an employee of the company that owned the Sea Story was a clear conflict of interest. Spanish diver Hissora Gonzalez said the man did not initially introduce himself as an employee. \"He just said, 'You have to tell me what happened, and then you have to sign this piece of paper.'\" It was not until later, say several people we spoke to, that the man told them he worked for Dive Pro Liveaboard. The survivors say that, after being translated by the man, their statements were handed to investigators - something that shocked Lisa Wolf. \"A normal judge can't take a translation from someone that's obviously totally involved in the process.\" One survivor, who is a Norwegian police investigator, said she had \"no clue\" what the four pages of Arabic handed back to her actually said. \"They could have written anything. I don't know what I signed,\" Frøydis Adamson explained. Under her signature she says she wrote that she had not been able to read the documents. \"We were in such shock and just wanted to go home,\" said Hissora. Representatives of the boat operators, Dive Pro Liveaboard, also repeatedly tried to push people into signing waivers - say survivors - which would have seen them agreeing to the statement: \"I do not accuse anyone of any criminal wrongdoing."}

The changes, which are set to come into force from 27 January, are a U-turn from a policy introduced six years ago that allowed people to linger in Starbucks outlets and use their toilets without making a purchase. The move is part of the \"back to Starbucks\" strategy - a plan announced by the firm's new boss as he tries to tackle flagging sales. Starbucks said there was no change to its policy in the UK, where customers can continue to use the facilities without purchasing anything. The world's biggest coffee chain says its new code of conduct - which also addresses harassment and bans smoking and outside alcohol - aims to make its stores more welcoming. \"Implementing a Coffeehouse Code of Conduct... is a practical step that helps us prioritise our paying customers who want to sit and enjoy our cafes,\" a Starbucks spokesperson told BBC News. \"These updates are part of a broader set of changes we are making to enhance the cafe experience as we work to get back to Starbucks.\" The company said the new rules would be displayed at every store and staff would be instructed to ask anyone who violates the code of conduct to leave. That includes allowing employees to call the police when necessary. The change ends a policy Starbucks introduced in 2018 after two black men were arrested at one of the company's stores in Philadelphia. The men, one of whom had asked to use the toilet, had said they were waiting for a friend and refused a manager's request to leave. The video of the incident went viral, and critics accused the chain of racial profiling and called for a boycott. Starbucks apologised to the men, agreed a settlement, and to help counter the backlash announced it would welcome people into their cafes, whether or not they were customers. Starbucks has been trying to boost flagging sales as it grappled with a backlash to price increases and boycotts sparked by the Israel-Gaza war. Brian Niccol, who previously headed the Mexican food chain Chipotle, wasbrought into Starbucks last yearto help turn the business around. Mr Niccol has been trying to improve the customer experience at Starbucks' cafes byrevamping its menusand coffee shops. Other changes set to be introduced later this month include offering one free refill of hot or iced coffee for customers who buy a drink to consume on the premises.

{"Article Number": 76, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg45l9q62w4o", "Text": "Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's pick for defence secretary in his upcoming presidency, cleared his first hurdle on the way to confirmation: a long - and at times tense - hearing before the US Senate's Armed Services Committee. For more than four hours on Tuesday, Hegseth faced questions about his ability to run the defence department, including its three million employees and $849bn (£695bn) budget. And although he was grilled by Democrats overaccusations of sexual assault, infidelity and drinking in the workplace, he appears all but certain to be confirmed to the role after no Republicans came out against him. This was underscored later on Tuesday when Joni Ernst, one Republican who had been seen as a potential roadblock to his nomination, said she would support him. Here's a look at the five main takeaways from Hegseth's testimony. From the very start of his testimony,Hegseth, a military veteran,emphasised what he called a \"warrior culture\", vowing to return the focus of the defence department to the strength of America's military. \"Warfighting, lethality, meritocracy, standards, and readiness. That's it. That is my job,\" he said in his opening statements. As the hearing continued, Hegseth was critical of policies he felt harmed the efficiency and \"lethality\" of the military, namely efforts aimed at racial and gender diversity. \"This is not a time for equity,\" he said, adding that he opposes quotas, which he claims hurt morale. In what became an expectedly partisan hearing, Democrats repeatedly grilled Hegseth on his past statements suggesting women were not suited to serve in combat roles in the military. Questions along these lines from Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Mazie Hirono and Elizabeth Warren provided some of the most heated moments of the morning. He spoke over Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, as she tried to point to comments about female service members stretching back years. \"Mr Hegseth, I'm quoting you in a podcast: 'Women shouldn't be in combat at all',\" Warren said. Hegseth remained composed, responding by saying his concern was not women in combat, but simply maintaining \"standards\" in the military. Hegseth, who at 44 would be the youngest defence secretary in decades, also answered questions about his preparedness to run the defence department, a sprawling agency. The former Fox News host described himself as a \"change agent\", saying \"it's time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm.\" Some Republicans deemed Hegseth's lack of experience a strength. \"I just want to say for all the talk of experience and not coming from the same cocktail parties that permanent Washington is used to, you are a breath of fresh air,\" Senator Eric Schmitt, a Republican from Missouri, said. A graduate of Princeton and Harvard universities, Hegseth was an infantry platoon leader in Guantanamo Bay and Iraq, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. Hegseth, also a former Fox News TV host, has military experience in Afghanistan as well. Still, Democrats pressed Hegseth on his qualifications for the top military job."}
{"Article Number": 77, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyxypryrnko", "Text": "At least 25people have died in the Los Angeles fires as two major blazes continue to burn across the sprawling US city. Firefighters made progress over the weekend in containing the Palisades and Eaton fires but warn that the return of high winds - forecast until Wednesday - could see these two spread again, or fuel new ones. The fires are already among the most destructive in LA's history when measured by the number of buildings destroyed. Rebuilding work will cost \"tens of billions\" of dollars, US President Joe Biden has said. An area to the north-west of the city centre is described by officials as \"particularly dangerous\". A red flag warning - indicating a high level of fire danger - is in place until 18:00 (02:00 GMT) on Wednesday, with the strongest Santa Ana winds expected on Tuesday. Nearby, the largest fire is in the Palisades area, and has burnt through more than 23,000 acres. It is still only about 14% contained, despite the efforts of thousands of firefighters. The blaze is moving east, threatening the exclusive neighbourhood of Brentwood, home to the Getty Center, a world-famous art museum that has evacuated its staff. Another fire, Eaton, is more deadly than Palisades so far - responsible for 16 of the deaths. The overall destruction is immense, with more than 12,000 structures - homes, outbuildings, sheds, mobile homes and cars - destroyed. Celebrities Mel Gibson and Paris Hilton are among those who have lost their homes. Tens of thousands of homes are also without power. The fires could turn out to be the costliest in US history, with damage projected at up to $150bn, according to a preliminary estimate by AccuWeather. There are three active fires in the wider area, while a smaller fire is nearly contained, say California fire officials: The earlier Kenneth, Archer, Sunset, Lidia, Woodley and Olivasfires have been contained. Containment describes the progress firefighters make in controlling the spread of flames. It is often listed as a percentage. For example, if a fire is 14% contained, that means fire crews have established barriers around 14% of the fire's perimeter. Natural barriers include roads, rivers and oceans. Firefighters can also create barriers using equipment such as bulldozers, hoses and shovels to remove vegetation down to the bare soil, meaning there is nothing for the fire to burn. A fire being 100% contained doesn't mean it has been extinguished, but rather that the flames have been fully encircled and the spread has been effectively stopped. Detectives continue to investigate the possible causes. Lightning - the most common source of fires in the US - has been ruled out as a cause for the Palisades and Eaton fires. There has been no official indication so far that arson or utility lines - the next two biggest culprits in sparking fires - caused any of the conflagrations. However, in the case of the Eaton fire, legal cases have been filed against the electrical company, Southern California Edison Company (SCE), claiming there is evidence that the blaze - one of the largest - was ignited due to negligence of the firm's overhead wires."}

Photos of him and stories of people who have met him are incredibly rare. But now a man who got the secretive artist to work with children at a youth club in the late 1990s has given the BBC an exclusive insight into the man behind the murals, just as he was about to become famous. Banksy is one of the world's most famous graffiti artists. His work has sold for millions of pounds and his exhibitions seen by hundreds of thousands of people. But behind layers of paint, lost in time at a Bristol youth club, there's a Banksy very few people know about. On the cusp of international fame, the artist was leaving his mark - not only on the streets of his city, but on young people in Lawrence Weston. Here, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural. \"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building. \"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\" Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous. The artist would return to the club several times to create new works, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds – oblivious to who the artist would eventually become. It was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol. His friend had a suggestion – someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself. That person was Banksy. \"I got his phone number, so I used to call him up and ask if he'd come and do some art projects. He was really keen,\" Peter said. This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police. Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids. The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub. \"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society. \"It was always very vibrant.\" Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \"nobody thought twice about who he was\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston. He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said. \"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego. He was doing art with them, rather than doing art for them,\" he said. \"In the morning, he sat around a table with the children, talking about their ideas."}

Yoon, 64, is being investigated on charges of insurrection for a failed martial law order on 3 December that plunged the country into turmoil. He has also been impeached by parliament and suspended - but will only be removed from office if the Constitutional Court upholds the impeachment. However, Yoon's dramatic arrest on Wednesday brings to an end a weeks-long standoff between investigators and his presidential security team. Investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) failed to arrest him on 3 January after being locked in a six-hour stand-off with his security detail. But just before dawn on Wednesday, a much larger team of investigators and police arrived at his residence in central Seoul, armed with ladders to climb over buses blocking its entrance and bolt cutters to remove barbed wire. Other officers in the arrest team, which numbered around 1,000, scaled walls and hiked up nearby trails to reach the presidential residence. After several hours, authorities announced that Yoon had been arrested. In a three-minute video released just before his arrest, the 64-year-old leader said he would co-operate with the investigators, while repeating previous claims that the warrant was not legally valid. \"I decided to appear before the CIO, even though it is an illegal investigation, in order to prevent any unsavoury bloodshed,\" he said, adding that he witnessed officials \"invade\" his home's security perimeter with fire equipment. On Wednesday afternoon, investigators said Yoon had remained silent throughout questioning. Yoon's lawyers have said his arrest was \"illegal\" because the CIO, as an anti-corruption agency, has no power to investigate the insurrection allegations against Yoon. They also claim the warrant was issued by the wrong jurisdiction. The same court later dismissed an injunction filed by President Yoon to invalidate the arrest warrant, which the authorities maintain is lawful. The opposition Democratic Party's floor leader, Park Chan-dae, said Wednesday's arrest showed that \"justice in South Korea is alive\". This arrest \"is the first step toward restoring constitutional order, democracy and the rule of law\", he said during a party meeting. The country is currently being led by Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok as acting president. He was thrust into power after the first acting president,Han Duck-soo, was also impeachedby parliament, where the opposition has a sizeable majority. The clock has started ticking for investigators. Under the current warrant, they can hold Yoon for up to 48 hours from the point of arrest, after which they need a new warrant to detain him while he continues to be investigated. If that warrant is granted, they can detain him for up to 20 days before he is brought to trial. Without a new warrant, Yoon must be released."}

{"Article Number": 117, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8ke9e27dxo", "Text": "India's latest diplomatic outreach to Afghanistan's Taliban government signals a marked shift in how it sees the geopolitical reality in the region. This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow whenKabul fell to the Taliban. Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns. Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban government expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\". Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports. How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me. \"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says. Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security. China, for example, has gone far: it has actively engaged with the Taliban government, focusing on security and economic interests, and even hasan ambassadorin the country. No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, but up to 40 countries maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with it. That's why experts like Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, are more circumspect about India's outreach. For the past three years, he says, India has maintained contact with the Taliban through a foreign service diplomat. India had closed its consulates in Afghanistan during the civil war in the 1990s and reopened them in 2002 after the war ended. \"We didn't want this hiatus to develop [again], so we wanted to engage. It is very simply a step up in relations,\" he says. India has\"historical and civilisational ties\" with Afghanistan, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament in 2023. India has invested more than $3bn (£2.46bn) in over 500 projects across Afghanistan, including roads, power lines, dams, hospitals and clinics. It has trained Afghan officers, awarded thousands of scholarships to students and built a new parliament building. This reflects a lasting geopolitical reality."}

They say the man also tried to get them to sign waivers which stated they did not accuse anyone of \"criminal wrongdoing\". The 11 survivors who have spoken to the BBC have also accused the Egyptian authorities of trying to cover up what happened, saying investigators were determined to blame it on a huge wave. The Sea Story had been carrying 46 people when it sank in the early hours of 25 November last year - four bodies were recovered and seven people are still missing, including two British divers. Neither the Egyptian government nor the boat operators - Dive Pro Liveaboard, based in Hurghada - have responded to our questions. On Tuesday,the BBC revealed multiple accusations from survivors of safety failingson board the vessel. A leading oceanographer who analysed weather data also said it was not plausible that a huge wave had hit the vessel. Within hours of being brought ashore, survivors say they were subjected to what one described as \"an interrogation\", some from their hospital beds, by people they were told were judges. Those who didn't need hospital treatment were interviewed at a nearby resort, said other survivors, who reported the same feelings of being pressured. \"We were told we couldn't leave the room until they'd done everybody's statements,\" says Sarah Martin, an NHS doctor from Lancashire. The judges were part of an Egyptian investigation into what caused the sinking - though survivors say it was not clear exactly who was leading it. The survivors say having their initial statements translated into Arabic by an employee of the company that owned the Sea Story was a clear conflict of interest. Spanish diver Hissora Gonzalez said the man did not initially introduce himself as an employee. \"He just said, 'You have to tell me what happened, and then you have to sign this piece of paper.'\" It was not until later, say several people we spoke to, that the man told them he worked for Dive Pro Liveaboard. The survivors say that, after being translated by the man, their statements were handed to investigators - something that shocked Lisa Wolf. \"A normal judge can't take a translation from someone that's obviously totally involved in the process.\" One survivor, who is a Norwegian police investigator, said she had \"no clue\" what the four pages of Arabic handed back to her actually said. \"They could have written anything. I don't know what I signed,\" Frøydis Adamson explained. Under her signature she says she wrote that she had not been able to read the documents. \"We were in such shock and just wanted to go home,\" said Hissora. Representatives of the boat operators, Dive Pro Liveaboard, also repeatedly tried to push people into signing waivers - say survivors - which would have seen them agreeing to the statement: \"I do not accuse anyone of any criminal wrongdoing."}

A senior Hamas official later told Reuters news agency it had not delivered its official response to the draft because Israel had yet to submit maps showing how its troops would withdraw from areas of Gaza. However, Israel's Haaretz newspaper cited an Israeli source as denying Hamas's claim about the maps. The proposed three-phase deal would begin with an initial six-week ceasefire. A Palestinian official told the BBC that Hamas would release three hostages on the first day of a deal, after which Israel would begin withdrawing troops from populated areas. More hostage releases would then be staggered over the following weeks, he said, with Israel allowing displaced residents to return in northern areas. Israel has said it expects 33 hostages to be released in the first phase and that it will free a yet to be determined number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails in return. Negotiations for the second phase - which should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli troop withdrawal and a \"sustainable calm\" - would start after two weeks. Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman said on Tuesday that there were no major issues were blocking a deal and that he was hopeful the talks would \"very soon lead to an agreement\". However, he also warned that that \"the most minor detail\" could yet undermine the process. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 46,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of the 2.3 million population has also been displaced, there is widespread destruction, and there are severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter due to an struggle to get aid to those in need. Israel says 94 of the hostages are still being held by Hamas, of whom 34 are presumed dead. In addition, there are four Israelis who were abducted before the war, two of whom are dead. Relatives of the remaining hostages have urged the Israeli government to do whatever it takes to get a deal over the line and bring all of them home. \"We can't miss this moment. This is the last moment; we can save them,\" said Hadas Kalderon, the wife of Ofer Kalderon, a 54-year-old. Palestinians also dared to hope that an end to the devastating 15-month war was close."}

Winds that have fanned wildfires in the US city of Los Angeles are again expected to kick up on Wednesday - after a 25th death from the huge, week-long outbreak was confirmed. Forecasters have again identified an area of \"extreme fire danger\", emphasising the risk level in a region to the north-west of the city centre. In some mountainous areas, it is possible for winds to reach speeds of 70mph (113km/h), which would be nearly hurricane-force if they are sustained. The anticipated increase in speeds threatens to spread the remaining four blazes, which firefighters have made further progress in tackling during a few days of calmer conditions. Wind speeds began a slow and steady climb on Wednesday morning in parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. They are expected to peak during the day on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Compared with last week's conditions, winds are \"weaker but still strong\", the NWS cautions. There are hopes of another drop over the subsequent days - but officials have highlighted the need for rain that would help fire crews in their battle. \"The anticipated winds combined with low humidities and low fuel moistures will keep the fire threat in the LA region critical,\" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said during a news conference on Tuesday. Areas to the north-west of Los Angeles - including Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks - have been deemed to be particularly dangerous. An improvement in conditions is forecast later on Thursday and into Friday, says BBC Weather forecaster Sarah Keith-Lucas. But no rainfall is forecast for at least the next week - and the Santa Ana winds that have been blamed for stoking the blazes could again develop from Sunday. The fire chief for the city of Pasadena echoed the need for precipitation. There had been no \"real rain in southern California\" for more than 250 days, Chad Augustin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. His firefighters would spent Wednesday on \"standing guard ready to ensure that we hold our containment lines and we don't burn up any more structures\", Mr Augustin added. An extreme weather attribution study from climate scientists at 'Climameter' has concluded that the Californian wildfires have been fuelled by meteorological conditions strengthened by human-induced climate change. The study found that current conditions have been up to 41F (5C) warmer, 15% drier and 20% windier compared to the past, in the areas affected by the fires. The 25th death from the fires was confirmed by the LA County Medical Examiner's Office. Thirteen other people remain missing. Most of the victims have died in the Eaton Fire, which has burned more than 14,000 acres to the city's north, but has now been 35% contained by firefighters. Further west, the larger Palisades Fire has torched more than 23,000 acres, and is now at 18% containment. Two smaller fires also continue to burn. Some of the victims of the Eaton Fire have now been allowed to return to their homes, although officials say they have no firm date for repopulation of the Palisades area, an upmarket area ravaged by the fire to which it lent its name."}

The term \"clinical obesity\" should be used for patients with a medical condition caused by their weight, while \"pre-clinically obese\" should be applied to those remaining fat but fit, although at risk of disease. This is better for patients than relying only on body mass index (BMI) - which measures whether they are a healthy weight for their height - to determine obesity. More than a billion people are estimated to beliving with obesity worldwideand prescription weight-loss drugs are in high demand. The report, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, is supported by more than 50 medical experts around the world.  \"Some individuals with obesity can maintain normal organ function and overall health, even long term, whereas others display signs and symptoms of severe illness here and now,\" Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, who chaired the expert group, said. \"Obesity is a spectrum,\" he added. The current, blanket definition means too many people are being diagnosed as obese but not receiving the most appropriate care, the report says. Natalie, from Crewe, goes to the gym four times a week and has a healthy diet, but is still overweight. \"I would consider myself on the larger side, but I'm fit,\" she told the BBC 5 Live phone-in with Nicky Campbell. \"If you look at my BMI I'm obese, but if I speak to my doctor they say that I'm fit, healthy and there's nothing wrong with me. \"I'm doing everything I can to stay fit and have a long healthy life,\" she said. Richard, from Falmouth, said there is a lot of confusion around BMI. \"When they did my test, it took me to a level of borderline obesity, but my body fat was only 4.9% - the problem is I had a lot of muscle mass,\" he says. In Mike's opinion, you cannot be fat and fit - he says it is all down to diet. \"All these skinny jabs make me laugh, if you want to lose weight stop eating - it's easy.\" Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as havinga BMI over 30- a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight. It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared. For example, if they are 70kg (about 11 stone) and 1.70m (about 5ft 7in): Find out what your body mass index (BMI) means on the NHS website But BMI has limitations. It measures whether someone is carrying too much weight - but not too much fat. So very muscular people, such as athletes, tend to have a high BMI but not much fat. The report says BMI is useful on a large scale, to work out the proportion of a population who are a healthy weight, overweight or obese. But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs. Measuring a patient's waists or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says."}

She had referred herself to the prime minister's standards adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, after questions about links to her aunt, who was ousted last year as Bangladesh's prime minister. Sir Laurie said he had \"not identified evidence of improprieties\" but it was \"regrettable\" that Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of the ties to her aunt. Siddiq said continuing in her role would be \"a distraction\" for the government but insisted she had done nothing wrong. Before her resignation was announced, Siddiq had been named in a second investigation in Bangladesh. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said the prime minister \"dithered and delayed to protect\" her. Writing on X, she said: \"It was clear at the weekend that the anti-corruption minister's position was completely untenable. Yet Keir Starmer dithered and delayed to protect his close friend. \"Even now, as Bangladesh files a criminal case against Tulip Siddiq, he expresses 'sadness' at her inevitable resignation. \"Weak leadership from a weak prime minister.\" In a letter accepting Siddiq's resignation, Sir Keir said the \"door remains open\" for her. Siddiq, whose role as Economic Secretary to the Treasuryincluded tackling corruption in UK financial markets,was named last month in an investigation into claims her family embezzled up to £3.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh. Her aunt is the former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, head of the Awami League, who fled into exile after being deposed last year. Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, also came under intense scrutiny over her use of properties in London linked to her aunt's allies. TheFinancial Times reportedthat one of the properties, a flat in King's Cross, had been given to her by a person connected with the recently ousted Bangladeshi government. According to the Mail on Sunday, in 2022 Siddiq had denied the flat was a gift and insisted her parents had bought it for her and had threatened the paper with legal action preventing publication of a story. Labour sources subsequently told the newspaper the flat had been gifted to Siddiq by a property developer with alleged links to her aunt. Sir Laurie spent eight days investigating the allegations after Siddiq referred herself to the standards watchdog. In his letter, Sir Laurie said Siddiq \"acknowledges that, over an extended period, she was unaware of the origins of her ownership of her flat in Kings Cross, despite having signed a Land Registry transfer form relating to the gift at the time\". He said the MP \"remained under the impression that her parents had given the flat to her, having purchased it from the previous owner\". This had led to the public being \"inadvertently misled\" about the identity of the donor of the flat, added Sir Laurie. Sir Laurie said this was an \"unfortunate misunderstanding\" which had led to Siddiq issuing a public correction of \"the origins of her ownership after she became a minister\"."}

It is followed closely by Netflix's Spanish-language musical Emilia Pérez, which tells the story of a Mexican cartel leader who leaves the world of crime to live a new life as a transgender woman. The frontrunners in the Bafta acting categories include Cynthia Erivo and Demi Moore for lead actress and Adrien Brody and Timothee Chalamet for lead actor. But Denzel Washington and Daniel Craig failed to make the shortlist for Gladiator II and Queer respectively. Hugh Grant's nomination in the lead actor category for horror film Heretic, and Saoirse Ronan as leading actress for The Outrun, are among some of the surprises. Jamie Lee Curtis is nominated in the supporting actress category for The Last Showgirl, but the film's main actress Pamela Anderson, who plays an ageing Las Vegas performer, missed out on a nomination. The leading films in the Bafta nominations 12 nominations - Conclave 11 - Emilia Pérez 9 - The Brutalist 7 - Anora, Dune: Part Two and Wicked 6 - A Complete Unknown and Kneecap 5 - Nosferatu and The Substance Another film tipped for success in the current awards season is Anora, which has seven Bafta nominations including best film. It follows the whirlwind romance between a New York sex worker and the son of a wealthy Russian oligarch. Mikey Madison is nominated as leading actress and is also up for the rising star award, which is voted for by the public. Her co-star Yura Borisov is nominated for best supporting actor, and director Sean Baker has his first Bafta best director nomination. Half of those nominated in the best director category are first-time nominees and also include The Brutalist's Brady Corbet, who won the same award at the Golden Globes. The film, about a Hungarian architect who is hired by a wealthy American after World War Two, has nine nods in total and is also tipped to be a big contender at the Oscars. The Substance director Coralie Fargeat is another first-time directing nominee and is the only female nominated in the category. Demi Moore is nominated for best actress for the film, weeks after winning at the Golden Globes - putting her in a strong position for the Oscars. Conclave's Edward Berger is also nominated for best director, and thanked the \"wonderful crew\" who helped the film earn 12 nominations. He had found \"a team of like-minded people who bond together to strive for the unattainable goal - perfection\", he said. British actress Marianne Jean-Baptiste's nomination in the same category for playing an irritable woman struggling with depression in Hard Truths has boosted momentum for her to receive an Oscar nomination. The Bafta shortlist is often a strong indicator for the Oscars, and last year the winners of the top six categories matched perfectly at the two ceremonies. Another Oscar-tipped film is A Complete Unknown, which follows Bob Dylan's rise to fame in the 1960s."}

Ever\". The 64-year-old was accused on Monday of sexual misconduct by eight women, including four who had previously spoken out. On Tuesday, in a blog post titled Breaking The Silence, Gaiman said he had read the allegations with \"horror and dismay\". He wrote: \"I've stayed quiet until now, both out of respect for the people who were sharing their stories and out of a desire not to draw even more attention to a lot of misinformation.\" He continued: \"I've always tried to be a private person, and felt increasingly that social media was the wrong place to talk about important personal matters. I've now reached the point where I feel that I should say something. \"As I read through this latest collection of accounts, there are moments I half-recognise and moments I don't, descriptions of things that happened sitting beside things that emphatically did not happen. \"I'm far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.\" The fantasy graphic novel and science-fiction writer - whose books Good Omens, American Gods and The Sandman have been adapted for television - was the subject of a New York Magazine cover story on Monday. The magazine and its website Vulture reported allegations from eight women, four of whom also previously accused Gaiman of sexual assault in July 2024 on a Tortoise Media podcast. One of the women, who had been babysitting Gaiman's five-year-old child, alleged that he offered her a bath in his garden before joining her in the tub naked, asking her to sit on his lap, and that he sexually assaulted her. The British author said he read back text messages from the time of the alleged incidents and felt they were \"of two people enjoying entirely consensual sexual relationships\". \"At the time I was in those relationships, they seemed positive and happy on both sides,\" he wrote. He acknowledged that he was \"careless with people's hearts and feelings\" and could have \"done so much better\", but said he doesn't \"accept there was any abuse\". The author said he understood that \"not everyone will believe me\" and added he would be \"doing my very best to deserve their trust, as well as the trust of my readers\". He claimed some of the allegations \"simply never happened\" while others had been \"distorted\" to \"bear no relationship to reality\", but said he would \"take responsibility for any missteps I made\". A police report accusing Gaiman of a sexual assault was made in January 2023, but the investigation was eventually dropped. Since the allegations surfaced, several of Gaiman's film and TV projects have been affected. Season three of Prime Video's Good Omens will now comprise one 90-minute episode, with Gaiman no longer involved. Disney has paused production on its film adaptation of another Gaiman title, The Graveyard Book, while Netflix has cancelled Dead Boy Detectives, although it's not clear if this was related to the allegations."}

The landers will eventually separate once they reach the Moon's orbit and conduct independent explorations. They are the latest in a growing number of commercial missions to the Moon. Firefly's rover, Blue Ghost, is expected to take about 45 days to reach the Moon,  once it has separated from the SpaceX rocket. It will then drill, collect samples and also take X-ray images of the Earth's magnetic field to \"advance research for future human missions on the Moon and provide insights into how space weather impacts the planet\", according to SpaceX. Meanwhile, ispace's Resilence lander will take up to five months to reach the Moon's surface, where it will deploy a rover for exploration and attempt to scoop up loose surface material known as regolith. Nasa is backing the endeavour, which, if successful, will be its biggest commercial delivery to the Moon so far. Intuitive Machines last year becamethe first commercial outfit to put a lander on the Moon, a feat only previously accomplished by the US, the Soviet Union, China, India and Japan.

The findings come as negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appear to be nearing a breakthrough. Mediators in Qatar say talks are in their final stages, raising hopes that an agreement could be reached soon. The \"humanitarian zone\" was first established by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in October 2023 toprotect civilians and keep them out of harms way. On 6 May 2024, the IDF significantly expanded the zone to include the cities of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah. The area - much of which is a strip of land along the Mediterranean sea - is densely populated and is estimated to have over a million people living there according to international humanitarian organisations. Many people are living in tents, with limited infrastructure and limited access to aid. Local media reports indicate more than 550 people have been killed in the 97 strikes mapped by BBC Verify. In a statement to BBC Verify, the IDF said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating in the \"humanitarian zone\" and accused the group of violating international law while \"exploiting\" civilians as human shields and launching rockets from the area. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's 7 October 2023 attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. The conflict has caused widespread damage to infrastructure across Gaza, with satellite images showing areas flattened by Israeli strikes. The Hamas-run health ministry also says more than 46,600 people have been killed within the enclave since the start of the war. BBC Verify analysis suggests that attacks within the \"humanitarian zone\" have intensified since May 2024, with at least 22 strikes already recorded so far this month. We also cannot confirm that all incidents are the result of IDF attacks. Locations of strikes documented by BBC Verify were provided to the IDF but they did not confirm or deny their involvement. Israeli military officials have only publicly acknowledged 28 attacks since 6 May. Israel historically has not publicly acknowledged every strike it has carried out in Gaza. Gavin Kelleher, an access manager in Gaza for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said there were \"near daily\" strikes within the zone, including from Israeli ships and quadcopters, or small drones. He added that \"heavy fire is recurrent in this area despite its [Israel's] unilateral 'humanitarian' designation.\" \"The Israeli military appears keen to maintain the illusion of a Humanitarian Zone that remains a certain size, yet that zone can be subject to 'evacuation orders' at any time and be targeted,\" Mr Kelleher said. One resident who lives within the zone, Khaled Abdel Rahman, told the BBC that residents were being subjected to daily bombardments, frequently resulting in injuries and casualties. \"We were displaced to Khan Younis because it was designated as a safe zone, but in fact we find nothing here but insecurity,\" Mr Rahman said."}

Photos of him and stories of people who have met him are incredibly rare. But now a man who got the secretive artist to work with children at a youth club in the late 1990s has given the BBC an exclusive insight into the man behind the murals, just as he was about to become famous. Banksy is one of the world's most famous graffiti artists. His work has sold for millions of pounds and his exhibitions seen by hundreds of thousands of people. But behind layers of paint, lost in time at a Bristol youth club, there's a Banksy very few people know about. On the cusp of international fame, the artist was leaving his mark - not only on the streets of his city, but on young people in Lawrence Weston. Here, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural. \"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building. \"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\" Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous. The artist would return to the club several times to create new works, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds – oblivious to who the artist would eventually become. It was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol. His friend had a suggestion – someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself. That person was Banksy. \"I got his phone number, so I used to call him up and ask if he'd come and do some art projects. He was really keen,\" Peter said. This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police. Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids. The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub. \"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society. \"It was always very vibrant.\" Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \"nobody thought twice about who he was\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston. He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said. \"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego. He was doing art with them, rather than doing art for them,\" he said. \"In the morning, he sat around a table with the children, talking about their ideas."}

Inauguration day includes a formal swearing-in ceremony as well as musical performances, a celebratory parade and a number of formal balls. Vice-President-elect JD Vance will also take the oath of office, joining Trump on stage to officially begin their new administration. The inauguration is the formal ceremony that marks the end of one president's time in office and the start of their successor's administration. It is the most high-profile part of the transition of power between government leaders in Washington DC. A key part of the ceremony includes the president-elect reciting the oath of office: \"I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" Though he won the election in November, Trump officially becomes the 47th president once he says those words. He previously served as the 45th president between 2017 and 2021. Vance will also take an oath of office before he formally assumes the position of vice-president. Trump's second inauguration day will kick off with a service at St. John's Church, Lafayette Square, a historic Washington DC church, followed by tea at the White House. Musical performances and opening remarks are set to begin on the main event stage - located on the West Lawn of the US Capitol building - at 09:30 EST (14:30 GMT). That will be followed by the swearing-in of Trump and Vance as well as the inaugural address in which the president will set out his goals for the next four years. Trump will then head inside to the President's Room - near the Senate chamber - to sign key documents. He will then attend a lunch hosted by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. This is followed by a parade which goes from the Capitol building down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Later in the evening, Trump will appear at three inaugural balls throughout the city - the Commander-in-Chief Ball, the Liberty Inaugural Ball and the Starlight Ball. He is expected to speak at all three. There is typically high demand to watch the inauguration in person, and tickets are highly sought after. Members of Congress receive a certain number of tickets to the ceremony, which they can distribute to their constituents. These tickets are free, but often challenging to get. Americans can contact their congressperson directly for tickets. If you're not able to attend in person, there are plenty of ways to watch remotely. The White House will livestream the inauguration. The BBC will carry inauguration coverage live on our news channel. You can also watch a stream of the inauguration on our website and follow our live page, where we'll bring you updates, analysis and key moments as they happen. Local and federal officials are expecting around 200,000 people to show up in Washington DC, which could include Trump supporters and protestors."}

But even if the country's highest judicial authority agrees with the lower courts - and Congress - that the platform is a threat to national security will that actually stop Americans using it? Will there be ways to bypass the ban - or could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop a law he says he opposed to, even if the courts uphold it. And whatever happens to TikTok, who stands to benefit from the uncertainty clouding its future? The most likely way the US would ban TikTok is to order app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, to make it unavailable for download in that region. US lawmakers have already told  tech firms to be ready to remove the app from their stores if a ban comes into force. That would mean people could no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok - though it would also mean people who've already got it would still have it on their phones. Because the app would not be publicly available anymore, new updates could no longer be delivered to users in the US - which would make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable. Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target. Of course, there are ways around such a ban. There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region. The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements. It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks. However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app. So if the ban took this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to. There are still other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether. And even if people did use a VPN, there are still ways TikTok could theoretically judge whether a person is based in the US - and then simply present them with a screen saying the app is not available in their country. It remains to be seen whether TikTok would decide to assist the government in its own ban - but it is being reported by Reuters that it plans to do so. TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US unless it rules in its favour."}

This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow whenKabul fell to the Taliban. Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns. Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban government expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\". Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports. How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me. \"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says. Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security. China, for example, has gone far: it has actively engaged with the Taliban government, focusing on security and economic interests, and even hasan ambassadorin the country. No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, but up to 40 countries maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with it. That's why experts like Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, are more circumspect about India's outreach. For the past three years, he says, India has maintained contact with the Taliban through a foreign service diplomat. India had closed its consulates in Afghanistan during the civil war in the 1990s and reopened them in 2002 after the war ended. \"We didn't want this hiatus to develop [again], so we wanted to engage. It is very simply a step up in relations,\" he says. India has\"historical and civilisational ties\" with Afghanistan, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament in 2023. India has invested more than $3bn (£2.46bn) in over 500 projects across Afghanistan, including roads, power lines, dams, hospitals and clinics. It has trained Afghan officers, awarded thousands of scholarships to students and built a new parliament building. This reflects a lasting geopolitical reality."}

Photos of him and stories of people who have met him are incredibly rare. But now a man who got the secretive artist to work with children at a youth club in the late 1990s has given the BBC an exclusive insight into the man behind the murals, just as he was about to become famous. Banksy is one of the world's most famous graffiti artists. His work has sold for millions of pounds and his exhibitions seen by hundreds of thousands of people. But behind layers of paint, lost in time at a Bristol youth club, there's a Banksy very few people know about. On the cusp of international fame, the artist was leaving his mark - not only on the streets of his city, but on young people in Lawrence Weston. Here, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural. \"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building. \"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\" Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous. The artist would return to the club several times to create new works, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds – oblivious to who the artist would eventually become. It was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol. His friend had a suggestion – someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself. That person was Banksy. \"I got his phone number, so I used to call him up and ask if he'd come and do some art projects. He was really keen,\" Peter said. This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police. Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids. The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub. \"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society. \"It was always very vibrant.\" Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \"nobody thought twice about who he was\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston. He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said. \"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego. He was doing art with them, rather than doing art for them,\" he said. \"In the morning, he sat around a table with the children, talking about their ideas."}

This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow whenKabul fell to the Taliban. Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns. Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban government expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\". Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports. How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me. \"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says. Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security.

In a memo to staff, boss Mark Zuckerberg said he had made the decision to speed up the firm's regular performance-based cuts in anticipation of an \"intense year\". He said the company would \"backfill\" the roles later in 2025. The company, which employs about 72,000 people globally, did not say how the cuts would be distributed around the world. Workers in the US who are affected will know by 10 February, according to Mr Zuckerberg's memo. Those outside the US will be informed \"later\". \"This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams,\" he wrote. \"I've decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster.\" The move comes on the heels of other big decisions by Mr Zuckerberg, including moves to end the company's fact-checking and diversity programmes. Performance-based job cuts are common in corporate America. At Meta, they would normally unfold over the course of a year, Mr Zuckerberg said, but the process is being accelerated this year. Roughly 3,600 people could be affected this move. They will receive \"generous severance\", he said. The last big cuts at Meta came in 2023, when the companycut about 10,000 positionsin a cost-cutting drive after Mr Zuckerberg declared it the \"year of efficiency\". Itcut about 11,000 roles in 2022. Mr Zuckerberg also appears to be overhauling his own public image. On a recent podcast with Joe Rogan, Mr Zuckerberg said he thought companies needed more \"masculine energy\" and discussed taking up martial arts, which he said he enjoyed because he felt he could more fully express himself, than in his corporate role. \"When you're running a company, people typically don't wanna see you being like this ruthless person who's just like I'm gonna crush the people I'm competing with,\" he said. \"But when you're fighting, it's like no.\" \"I think in some ways when people see me competing in the sport they're like oh no, 'That's the real Mark.\" In an exclusive interview, Ian Russell tells the BBC that he believes there is \"no real movement\" within government on online safety.

Some horses came solo, others in trailers packed with fellow animals. Many had their owners, but others arrived alone, brought in by their rescuers or animal control. Pigs, donkeys and miniature horses followed. Within 24 hours, the Los Angeles Equestrian Center had been transformed into a modern-day Noah's Ark. Over the last week, it has sheltered hundreds of animals from the disaster as part of its official role as one of the city's large animal shelters. The facility, tucked in the shadow of Griffith Park, has taken in more than 200 horses, on top of the roughly 500 already living there.  Last Tuesday and Wednesday were \"chaos\", said Jennie Nevin, a spokeswoman for the equestrian centre. The facility catalogued every horse that arrived, making sure they could be reunited. Sheltering the animals came at no cost for the owners, thanks to the support of public donations and frequent drop-offs of free hay, feed and other supplies. Sergio Marcial was one of dozens of people who brought animals here after their own facilities were destroyed or threatened. A week ago, he and his girlfriend Jenny Bacon raced to help rescue more than 70 animals from theEaton Dam Stables while battling flames so intense that his face mask caught fire and his eyeglasses shattered and warped. His efforts landed him in the hospital, his lungs and throat burned after inhaling the torched air. One week later, Mr Marcial, 29, and Ms Bacon, 30, walked Arthur and Playboy - two miniature horses he helped save that night - around their new home. Here, they were safe from the fires, and they seemed calm and friendly despite everything they had endured. \"It still hurts to swallow,\" Mr Marcial said, pointing to a face mask he's required to wear to prevent infections. \"I'd do it all again - no question.\" Most of the sheltered animals' owners have been identified, and several owners spent Tuesday afternoon walking their horses around the stables. Dozens of volunteers cared for the other animals staying at the centre. Some had become local celebrities. Two donkeys, Morris and Mika, frequently poked their heads out of their stables to demand attention. They had fled down the mountain with their owner as the Palisades fire drew near, and were reunited because he had spray-painted his number on to their sides. \"They love for you to sing to them,\" said volunteer Lucena Herrera. \"We've all just been adopting them and taking care of them.\" But a handful of animals still have not been claimed. A miniature horse named Izzy had still not found her owner a week after the fires. The volunteers had collectively adopted her until she could find a new, permanent home.  So many volunteers showed up to help the animals that the staff had to turn some away, Ms Nevin said. Between 50-100 volunteers now raked stalls, fed the animals, fluffed hay and serenaded Morris and Mika when they grew antsy."}
{"Article Number": 141, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyv433le3vno", "Text": "Drake has scrapped a legal case against Universal Music and Spotify, in which he accused the companies of conspiring to boost the streams of Kendrick Lamar's diss track against him, Not Like Us. The Canadian startook action last November, alleging that the music companies had used bots, payola and other methods to promote Lamar's song, which accused him of paedophilia. \"The record-shattering spread of Not Like Us on streaming, sales, and radio play was deliberate and appears to have relied upon irregular and inappropriate business practices,\" court documents alleged. However, on Tuesday, Drake's lawyers voluntarily withdrew a pre-action filing, effectively ending the case. According to court documents filed in New York, the star met with representatives of Spotify and Universal on Tuesday to discuss the case. Spotify, which had filed an opposition, had no objection to the withdrawal and discontinuance. Universal, which hadn't filed an opposition, reserved its position. A related case, filed against Universal and radio network iHeartRadio in Texas, is still active.  Not Like Us was widely regarded as the decisive blow in a long-running feud between Drake and Lamar, which dates back to the early 2010s. In the lyrics, Lamar alleges that Drake \"likes 'em young\" and accuses him of using other, more credible rappers, to boost his profile. Around 24 hours later, Drake responded with a track called The Heart Part 6, where he rejected the allegations, saying, \"I never been with no one under age\". He also  claimed to have fed Lamar \"false\" information through a double agent. However, his retort failed to attract the same attention as Not Like Us, which debuted at number one in the US chart and attracted more than 1 billion streams on Spotify. Taking to the courts, Drake accused Universal - which distributes both his music and Lamar's - of artificially boosting the song's numbers. In court documents, he claimed that the label licensed the song \"at drastically reduced rates to Spotify\" and used bots to stream the song, generating \"the false impression that the song was more popular than it was in reality\".  The papers were not a lawsuit, but a \"pre-action petition\", in which Drake's lawyers sought to gain access to internal documents at Spotify and Universal which might have supported their case. In a statement at the time, Universal told the BBC: \"The suggestion that [the company] would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue. \"We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns. No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\" Spotify also responded that there was \"no economic incentive for users to stream Not Like Us over any of Drake's tracks\". The Swedish streaming company later filed an opposition brief to Drake's petition, stating that it \"should be denied\". Music industry experts had been sceptical that the accusations would ever reach trial."}
{"Article Number": 142, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8kqq2y0g3o", "Text": "A Kenyan government minister has alleged that the country's national intelligence agency was behind the abduction of his son last year, as criticism against the rising cases of abductions continues. Public Service Cabinet Secretary Justin Muturi said that it took a call by President William Ruto to have his son released by the National Intelligence Service (NIS). Muturi is the first member of the cabinet to publicly criticise the government's handling of the spate of abductions in Kenya. In a statement to the police crime investigations unit on Tuesday, Muturi gave a detailed account of how his son, Leslie, was abducted on 22 June last year. Mr Ruto and the intelligence agency have not commented on his allegations. At least 80 people, including the minister's son, have been abducted in the last six months, according to a state-funded rights group. The wave of abductions started after protests against tax hikes last June, and have continued since then. Some of those abducted have been released following public pressure. Earlier this week, the minister told journalists that he had not received answers about the abduction of his son, despite reaching out to top security officials. Muturi said the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) subsequently urged him to record a statement with them, telling him the matter was still under investigation. In his statement to the DCI, Muturi recalled calling the inspector-general of police, the interior minister, the DCI head, the head of the intelligence agency and other top officials as he desperately looked for his son – but, he added, all were unable to help. He said that he also messaged Ruto, but later decided to visit his official residence to raise the matter directly with him. \"I then narrated the ordeal [to the president] including my interactions with various senior government officials who had been unable to help. I expressed my belief that NIS was holding my son,\" Muturi said in the statement. He said that the president made a joke about the issue and then made a call to the head of the intelligence agency, who promised to release his son in an hour. \"I heard the president ask [NIS director] Noordin Haji if he was holding my son. [He] confirmed that indeed he was holding my son and the president instructed him to release Leslie immediately,\" Muturi added. Muturi has faced calls from some government-allied politicians to resign for publicly criticising the government in which he serves. Foreign nationals have also been abducted, including prominent Tanzanian activist Maria Sarungi Tsehai, who on Monday narrated how she was kidnapped by armed men and released several hours later. Last year, Ugandan opposition leader Kizza Besigye was kidnapped in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, allegedly by Ugandan security officials, and taken across the border for trial by a court martial. Muturi's public mentioning of Ruto's name in connection with abductions is a defiant challenge to the president, and is seen as being against the principle of collective responsibility in government."}

The sheet music was kept at his family's music production company - which burnt down in the Pacific Palisades neighbourhood last week. While no original manuscripts were lost, the music owned by Belmont Music Publishing had been the main collection of scores rented out to orchestras and musicians. The director of the American Symphony Orchestra, Leon Botstein, said these had been an \"indispensable resource\" for performing musicians. Schoenberg's son, Larry, 83, said the sheet music had been kept in a building behind his house. Both buildings were razed in the fires last week. Other Schoenberg memorabilia was also destroyed, including photographs, letters and posters. \"For a company that focused exclusively on the works of Schoenberg, this loss represents not just a physical destruction of property but a profound cultural blow,\" said Larry in a statement. He described the collection as \"essential\" for musicians who rely on the \"meticulously curated editions\" of his father's back catalogue. Arnold Schoenberg was born into a Jewish family in Vienna in 1874. He went on to find huge success as a composer in Berlin before fleeing to the US in 1933 to avoid persecution from the Nazis. He eventually settled in Los Angeles where he continued his groundbreaking compositions. He was known for atonality and his 12-tones technique which departed from conventional harmonies. He died in 1951 at the age of 76 in Los Angeles. In a statement Belmont said it was hoping to create digital copies of the scores. \"We hope that in the near future we will be able to 'rise from the ashes' in a completely digital form,\" the statement said. Most of Schoenberg's original manuscripts are held at a museum in Vienna, Austria. Firefighters are still battling to control the huge wildfires in Los Angeles which began in early January.

Some horses came solo, others in trailers packed with fellow animals. Many had their owners, but others arrived alone, brought in by their rescuers or animal control. Pigs, donkeys and miniature horses followed. Within 24 hours, the Los Angeles Equestrian Center had been transformed into a modern-day Noah's Ark. Over the last week, it has sheltered hundreds of animals from the disaster as part of its official role as one of the city's large animal shelters. The facility, tucked in the shadow of Griffith Park, has taken in more than 200 horses, on top of the roughly 500 already living there.  Last Tuesday and Wednesday were \"chaos\", said Jennie Nevin, a spokeswoman for the equestrian centre. The facility catalogued every horse that arrived, making sure they could be reunited. Sheltering the animals came at no cost for the owners, thanks to the support of public donations and frequent drop-offs of free hay, feed and other supplies. Sergio Marcial was one of dozens of people who brought animals here after their own facilities were destroyed or threatened. A week ago, he and his girlfriend Jenny Bacon raced to help rescue more than 70 animals from theEaton Dam Stables while battling flames so intense that his face mask caught fire and his eyeglasses shattered and warped. His efforts landed him in the hospital, his lungs and throat burned after inhaling the torched air. One week later, Mr Marcial, 29, and Ms Bacon, 30, walked Arthur and Playboy - two miniature horses he helped save that night - around their new home. Here, they were safe from the fires, and they seemed calm and friendly despite everything they had endured. \"It still hurts to swallow,\" Mr Marcial said, pointing to a face mask he's required to wear to prevent infections. \"I'd do it all again - no question.\" Most of the sheltered animals' owners have been identified, and several owners spent Tuesday afternoon walking their horses around the stables. Dozens of volunteers cared for the other animals staying at the centre. Some had become local celebrities. Two donkeys, Morris and Mika, frequently poked their heads out of their stables to demand attention. They had fled down the mountain with their owner as the Palisades fire drew near, and were reunited because he had spray-painted his number on to their sides. \"They love for you to sing to them,\" said volunteer Lucena Herrera. \"We've all just been adopting them and taking care of them.\" But a handful of animals still have not been claimed. A miniature horse named Izzy had still not found her owner a week after the fires. The volunteers had collectively adopted her until she could find a new, permanent home.  So many volunteers showed up to help the animals that the staff had to turn some away, Ms Nevin said. Between 50-100 volunteers now raked stalls, fed the animals, fluffed hay and serenaded Morris and Mika when they grew antsy."}

The sheet music was kept at his family's music production company - which burnt down in the Pacific Palisades neighbourhood last week. While no original manuscripts were lost, the music owned by Belmont Music Publishing had been the main collection of scores rented out to orchestras and musicians. The director of the American Symphony Orchestra, Leon Botstein, said these had been an \"indispensable resource\" for performing musicians. Schoenberg's son, Larry, 83, said the sheet music had been kept in a building behind his house. Both buildings were razed in the fires last week. Other Schoenberg memorabilia was also destroyed, including photographs, letters and posters. \"For a company that focused exclusively on the works of Schoenberg, this loss represents not just a physical destruction of property but a profound cultural blow,\" said Larry in a statement. He described the collection as \"essential\" for musicians who rely on the \"meticulously curated editions\" of his father's back catalogue. Arnold Schoenberg was born into a Jewish family in Vienna in 1874. He went on to find huge success as a composer in Berlin before fleeing to the US in 1933 to avoid persecution from the Nazis. He eventually settled in Los Angeles where he continued his groundbreaking compositions. He was known for atonality and his 12-tones technique which departed from conventional harmonies. He died in 1951 at the age of 76 in Los Angeles. In a statement Belmont said it was hoping to create digital copies of the scores. \"We hope that in the near future we will be able to 'rise from the ashes' in a completely digital form,\" the statement said. Most of Schoenberg's original manuscripts are held at a museum in Vienna, Austria. Firefighters are still battling to control the huge wildfires in Los Angeles which began in early January. So far they have killed at least 24 people, destroyed thousands of buildings and forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes.

Yoon, 64, is being investigated on charges of insurrection for a failed martial law order on 3 December that plunged the country into turmoil. He has also been impeached by parliament and suspended - but will only be removed from office if the Constitutional Court upholds the impeachment. However, Yoon's dramatic arrest on Wednesday brings to an end a weeks-long standoff between investigators and his presidential security team. Investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) failed to arrest him on 3 January after being locked in a six-hour stand-off with his security detail. But just before dawn on Wednesday, a much larger team of investigators and police arrived at his residence in central Seoul, armed with ladders to climb over buses blocking its entrance and bolt cutters to remove barbed wire. Other officers in the arrest team, which numbered around 1,000, scaled walls and hiked up nearby trails to reach the presidential residence. After several hours, authorities announced that Yoon had been arrested. In a three-minute video released just before his arrest, the 64-year-old leader said he would co-operate with the investigators, while repeating previous claims that the warrant was not legally valid. \"I decided to appear before the CIO, even though it is an illegal investigation, in order to prevent any unsavoury bloodshed,\" he said, adding that he witnessed officials \"invade\" his home's security perimeter with fire equipment. On Wednesday afternoon, investigators said Yoon had remained silent throughout questioning. Yoon's lawyers have said his arrest was \"illegal\" because the CIO, as an anti-corruption agency, has no power to investigate the insurrection allegations against Yoon. They also claim the warrant was issued by the wrong jurisdiction. The same court later dismissed an injunction filed by President Yoon to invalidate the arrest warrant, which the authorities maintain is lawful. The opposition Democratic Party's floor leader, Park Chan-dae, said Wednesday's arrest showed that \"justice in South Korea is alive\". This arrest \"is the first step toward restoring constitutional order, democracy and the rule of law\", he said during a party meeting. The country is currently being led by Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok as acting president. He was thrust into power after the first acting president,Han Duck-soo, was also impeachedby parliament, where the opposition has a sizeable majority. The clock has started ticking for investigators. Under the current warrant, they can hold Yoon for up to 48 hours from the point of arrest, after which they need a new warrant to detain him while he continues to be investigated. If that warrant is granted, they can detain him for up to 20 days before he is brought to trial. Without a new warrant, Yoon must be released."}

Winds that have fanned wildfires in the US city of Los Angeles are again expected to kick up on Wednesday - after a 25th death from the huge, week-long outbreak was confirmed. Forecasters have again identified an area of \"extreme fire danger\", emphasising the risk level in a region to the north-west of the city centre. In some mountainous areas, it is possible for winds to reach speeds of 70mph (113km/h), which would be nearly hurricane-force if they are sustained. The anticipated increase in speeds threatens to spread the remaining four blazes, which firefighters have made further progress in tackling during a few days of calmer conditions. Wind speeds began a slow and steady climb on Wednesday morning in parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. They are expected to peak during the day on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Compared with last week's conditions, winds are \"weaker but still strong\", the NWS cautions. There are hopes of another drop over the subsequent days - but officials have highlighted the need for rain that would help fire crews in their battle. \"The anticipated winds combined with low humidities and low fuel moistures will keep the fire threat in the LA region critical,\" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said during a news conference on Tuesday. Areas to the north-west of Los Angeles - including Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks - have been deemed to be particularly dangerous. An improvement in conditions is forecast later on Thursday and into Friday, says BBC Weather forecaster Sarah Keith-Lucas. But no rainfall is forecast for at least the next week - and the Santa Ana winds that have been blamed for stoking the blazes could again develop from Sunday. The fire chief for the city of Pasadena echoed the need for precipitation. There had been no \"real rain in southern California\" for more than 250 days, Chad Augustin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. His firefighters would spent Wednesday on \"standing guard ready to ensure that we hold our containment lines and we don't burn up any more structures\", Mr Augustin added. An extreme weather attribution study from climate scientists at 'Climameter' has concluded that the Californian wildfires have been fuelled by meteorological conditions strengthened by human-induced climate change. The study found that current conditions have been up to 41F (5C) warmer, 15% drier and 20% windier compared to the past, in the areas affected by the fires. The 25th death from the fires was confirmed by the LA County Medical Examiner's Office. Thirteen other people remain missing. Most of the victims have died in the Eaton Fire, which has burned more than 14,000 acres to the city's north, but has now been 35% contained by firefighters. Further west, the larger Palisades Fire has torched more than 23,000 acres, and is now at 18% containment. Two smaller fires also continue to burn. Some of the victims of the Eaton Fire have now been allowed to return to their homes, although officials say they have no firm date for repopulation of the Palisades area, an upmarket area ravaged by the fire to which it lent its name."}

This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow whenKabul fell to the Taliban. Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns. Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban government expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\". Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports. How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me. \"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says. Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security. China, for example, has gone far: it has actively engaged with the Taliban government, focusing on security and economic interests, and even hasan ambassadorin the country. No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, but up to 40 countries maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with it. That's why experts like Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, are more circumspect about India's outreach. For the past three years, he says, India has maintained contact with the Taliban through a foreign service diplomat. India had closed its consulates in Afghanistan during the civil war in the 1990s and reopened them in 2002 after the war ended. \"We didn't want this hiatus to develop [again], so we wanted to engage. It is very simply a step up in relations,\" he says. India has\"historical and civilisational ties\" with Afghanistan, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament in 2023. India has invested more than $3bn (£2.46bn) in over 500 projects across Afghanistan, including roads, power lines, dams, hospitals and clinics. It has trained Afghan officers, awarded thousands of scholarships to students and built a new parliament building. This reflects a lasting geopolitical reality."}

The term \"clinical obesity\" should be used for patients with a medical condition caused by their weight, while \"pre-clinically obese\" should be applied to those remaining fat but fit, although at risk of disease. This is better for patients than relying only on body mass index (BMI) - which measures whether they are a healthy weight for their height - to determine obesity. More than a billion people are estimated to beliving with obesity worldwideand prescription weight-loss drugs are in high demand. The report, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, is supported by more than 50 medical experts around the world.  \"Some individuals with obesity can maintain normal organ function and overall health, even long term, whereas others display signs and symptoms of severe illness here and now,\" Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, who chaired the expert group, said. \"Obesity is a spectrum,\" he added. The current, blanket definition means too many people are being diagnosed as obese but not receiving the most appropriate care, the report says. Natalie, from Crewe, goes to the gym four times a week and has a healthy diet, but is still overweight. \"I would consider myself on the larger side, but I'm fit,\" she told the BBC 5 Live phone-in with Nicky Campbell. \"If you look at my BMI I'm obese, but if I speak to my doctor they say that I'm fit, healthy and there's nothing wrong with me. \"I'm doing everything I can to stay fit and have a long healthy life,\" she said. Richard, from Falmouth, said there is a lot of confusion around BMI. \"When they did my test, it took me to a level of borderline obesity, but my body fat was only 4.9% - the problem is I had a lot of muscle mass,\" he says. In Mike's opinion, you cannot be fat and fit - he says it is all down to diet. \"All these skinny jabs make me laugh, if you want to lose weight stop eating - it's easy.\" Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as havinga BMI over 30- a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight. It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared. For example, if they are 70kg (about 11 stone) and 1.70m (about 5ft 7in): Find out what your body mass index (BMI) means on the NHS website But BMI has limitations. It measures whether someone is carrying too much weight - but not too much fat. So very muscular people, such as athletes, tend to have a high BMI but not much fat. The report says BMI is useful on a large scale, to work out the proportion of a population who are a healthy weight, overweight or obese. But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs. Measuring a patient's waists or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says."}
{"Article Number": 150, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp5xe1zwgo", "Text": "Just before dawn on Wednesday, 3,000 police officers arrived at the heavily-fortified residence of South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol. Their mission: to arrest him. Investigators used ladders to scale over buses and bolt cutters to get through barbed wire as they broke through multiple blockades designed to stop them. Others hiked up nearby trails to reach the presidential residence. Hours later, they took him into custody for questioning over an alleged act of insurrection. This was their second attempt. Their first, which took place earlier this month, had seen some 150 officers face a six-hour deadlock with the president's security detail. They were helplessly outnumbered, first by the large number of pro-Yoon supporters who had gathered outside his residence to stop the police, and then by a human wall of security officers inside the property. Eventually, investigators concluded that it was \"practically impossible\" to arrest him - and left. Many now see Yoon as a disgraced leader - impeached and suspended from his presidential duties for trying to impose martial law, while heawaits the decision of the Constitutional Court, which can remove him from office. So why has it been so difficult to arrest him? It has been an unprecedented few weeks for South Korea since Yoon's shocking yet short-lived martial law order on 3 December. Lawmakers voted to impeach him, then came a criminal investigation and his refusal to appear for questioning, which was what sparked the arrest warrant. One key roadblock for the arresting officers had been Yoon's presidential security team, which on 3 January had formed a human wall and used vehicles to block the officers' path. Analysts said they could have acted out of loyalty to Yoon, pointing to the fact that Yoon himself had appointed several leaders of the Presidential Security Service (PSS). \"It may well be the case that Yoon has seeded the organisation with hardline loyalists in preparation for precisely this eventuality,\" says US-based lawyer and Korea expert Christopher Jumin Lee. It is unclear why they reportedly put up less resistance this time, though Mr Lee believes the team may have been partly deterred by the \"overwhelming show of force by the police\". \"At the end of the day I think they were simply unwilling to engage in the sort of large-scale violence against law enforcement officers that a full-throated defence of Yoon would have demanded,\" he said. Earlier this week, the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) had warned the PSS that they risked losing their pensions and their civil servant status for obstructing the arrest. In contrast, it reassured those who \"defy illegal orders\" to block the arrest that they \"will not face disadvantages\". On Wednesday, Yonhap news agency reported that a number of PSS members were either on leave or had chosen to stay inside the residence. The right-wing leader also has a strong support base. Some of Yoon's supporters had earlier told the BBC that they wereprepared to die to protect himand  repeated unfounded allegations that Yoon himself has floated, including that the country had been infiltrated by pro-North Korea forces."}

They say the man also tried to get them to sign waivers which stated they did not accuse anyone of \"criminal wrongdoing\". The 11 survivors who have spoken to the BBC have also accused the Egyptian authorities of trying to cover up what happened, saying investigators were determined to blame it on a huge wave. The Sea Story had been carrying 46 people when it sank in the early hours of 25 November last year - four bodies were recovered and seven people are still missing, including two British divers. Neither the Egyptian government nor the boat operators - Dive Pro Liveaboard, based in Hurghada - have responded to our questions. On Tuesday,the BBC revealed multiple accusations from survivors of safety failingson board the vessel. A leading oceanographer who analysed weather data also said it was not plausible that a huge wave had hit the vessel. Within hours of being brought ashore, survivors say they were subjected to what one described as \"an interrogation\", some from their hospital beds, by people they were told were judges. Those who didn't need hospital treatment were interviewed at a nearby resort, said other survivors, who reported the same feelings of being pressured. \"We were told we couldn't leave the room until they'd done everybody's statements,\" says Sarah Martin, an NHS doctor from Lancashire. The judges were part of an Egyptian investigation into what caused the sinking - though survivors say it was not clear exactly who was leading it. The survivors say having their initial statements translated into Arabic by an employee of the company that owned the Sea Story was a clear conflict of interest. Spanish diver Hissora Gonzalez said the man did not initially introduce himself as an employee. \"He just said, 'You have to tell me what happened, and then you have to sign this piece of paper.'\" It was not until later, say several people we spoke to, that the man told them he worked for Dive Pro Liveaboard. The survivors say that, after being translated by the man, their statements were handed to investigators - something that shocked Lisa Wolf. \"A normal judge can't take a translation from someone that's obviously totally involved in the process.\" One survivor, who is a Norwegian police investigator, said she had \"no clue\" what the four pages of Arabic handed back to her actually said. \"They could have written anything. I don't know what I signed,\" Frøydis Adamson explained. Under her signature she says she wrote that she had not been able to read the documents. \"We were in such shock and just wanted to go home,\" said Hissora. Representatives of the boat operators, Dive Pro Liveaboard, also repeatedly tried to push people into signing waivers - say survivors - which would have seen them agreeing to the statement: \"I do not accuse anyone of any criminal wrongdoing."}

The changes, which are set to come into force from 27 January, are a U-turn from a policy introduced six years ago that allowed people to linger in Starbucks outlets and use their toilets without making a purchase. The move is part of the \"back to Starbucks\" strategy - a plan announced by the firm's new boss as he tries to tackle flagging sales. Starbucks said there was no change to its policy in the UK, where customers can continue to use the facilities without purchasing anything. The world's biggest coffee chain says its new code of conduct - which also addresses harassment and bans smoking and outside alcohol - aims to make its stores more welcoming. \"Implementing a Coffeehouse Code of Conduct... is a practical step that helps us prioritise our paying customers who want to sit and enjoy our cafes,\" a Starbucks spokesperson told BBC News. \"These updates are part of a broader set of changes we are making to enhance the cafe experience as we work to get back to Starbucks.\" The company said the new rules would be displayed at every store and staff would be instructed to ask anyone who violates the code of conduct to leave. That includes allowing employees to call the police when necessary. The change ends a policy Starbucks introduced in 2018 after two black men were arrested at one of the company's stores in Philadelphia. The men, one of whom had asked to use the toilet, had said they were waiting for a friend and refused a manager's request to leave. The video of the incident went viral, and critics accused the chain of racial profiling and called for a boycott. Starbucks apologised to the men, agreed a settlement, and to help counter the backlash announced it would welcome people into their cafes, whether or not they were customers. Starbucks has been trying to boost flagging sales as it grappled with a backlash to price increases and boycotts sparked by the Israel-Gaza war.

Mr Niccol has been trying to improve the customer experience at Starbucks' cafes byrevamping its menusand coffee shops.

For more than four hours on Tuesday, Hegseth faced questions about his ability to run the defence department, including its three million employees and $849bn (£695bn) budget. And although he was grilled by Democrats overaccusations of sexual assault, infidelity and drinking in the workplace, he appears all but certain to be confirmed to the role after no Republicans came out against him. This was underscored later on Tuesday when Joni Ernst, one Republican who had been seen as a potential roadblock to his nomination, said she would support him. Here's a look at the five main takeaways from Hegseth's testimony. From the very start of his testimony,Hegseth, a military veteran,emphasised what he called a \"warrior culture\", vowing to return the focus of the defence department to the strength of America's military. \"Warfighting, lethality, meritocracy, standards, and readiness. That's it. That is my job,\" he said in his opening statements. As the hearing continued, Hegseth was critical of policies he felt harmed the efficiency and \"lethality\" of the military, namely efforts aimed at racial and gender diversity. \"This is not a time for equity,\" he said, adding that he opposes quotas, which he claims hurt morale. In what became an expectedly partisan hearing, Democrats repeatedly grilled Hegseth on his past statements suggesting women were not suited to serve in combat roles in the military. Questions along these lines from Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Mazie Hirono and Elizabeth Warren provided some of the most heated moments of the morning. He spoke over Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, as she tried to point to comments about female service members stretching back years. \"Mr Hegseth, I'm quoting you in a podcast: 'Women shouldn't be in combat at all',\" Warren said. Hegseth remained composed, responding by saying his concern was not women in combat, but simply maintaining \"standards\" in the military. Hegseth, who at 44 would be the youngest defence secretary in decades, also answered questions about his preparedness to run the defence department, a sprawling agency. The former Fox News host described himself as a \"change agent\", saying \"it's time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm.\" Some Republicans deemed Hegseth's lack of experience a strength. \"I just want to say for all the talk of experience and not coming from the same cocktail parties that permanent Washington is used to, you are a breath of fresh air,\" Senator Eric Schmitt, a Republican from Missouri, said. A graduate of Princeton and Harvard universities, Hegseth was an infantry platoon leader in Guantanamo Bay and Iraq, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. Hegseth, also a former Fox News TV host, has military experience in Afghanistan as well. Still, Democrats pressed Hegseth on his qualifications for the top military job."}

Firefighters made progress over the weekend in containing the Palisades and Eaton fires but warn that the return of high winds - forecast until Wednesday - could see these two spread again, or fuel new ones. The fires are already among the most destructive in LA's history when measured by the number of buildings destroyed. Rebuilding work will cost \"tens of billions\" of dollars, US President Joe Biden has said. An area to the north-west of the city centre is described by officials as \"particularly dangerous\". A red flag warning - indicating a high level of fire danger - is in place until 18:00 (02:00 GMT) on Wednesday, with the strongest Santa Ana winds expected on Tuesday. Nearby, the largest fire is in the Palisades area, and has burnt through more than 23,000 acres. It is still only about 14% contained, despite the efforts of thousands of firefighters. The blaze is moving east, threatening the exclusive neighbourhood of Brentwood, home to the Getty Center, a world-famous art museum that has evacuated its staff. Another fire, Eaton, is more deadly than Palisades so far - responsible for 16 of the deaths. The overall destruction is immense, with more than 12,000 structures - homes, outbuildings, sheds, mobile homes and cars - destroyed. Celebrities Mel Gibson and Paris Hilton are among those who have lost their homes. Tens of thousands of homes are also without power. The fires could turn out to be the costliest in US history, with damage projected at up to $150bn, according to a preliminary estimate by AccuWeather. There are three active fires in the wider area, while a smaller fire is nearly contained, say California fire officials: The earlier Kenneth, Archer, Sunset, Lidia, Woodley and Olivasfires have been contained. Containment describes the progress firefighters make in controlling the spread of flames. It is often listed as a percentage. For example, if a fire is 14% contained, that means fire crews have established barriers around 14% of the fire's perimeter. Natural barriers include roads, rivers and oceans. Firefighters can also create barriers using equipment such as bulldozers, hoses and shovels to remove vegetation down to the bare soil, meaning there is nothing for the fire to burn. A fire being 100% contained doesn't mean it has been extinguished, but rather that the flames have been fully encircled and the spread has been effectively stopped. Detectives continue to investigate the possible causes. Lightning - the most common source of fires in the US - has been ruled out as a cause for the Palisades and Eaton fires. There has been no official indication so far that arson or utility lines - the next two biggest culprits in sparking fires - caused any of the conflagrations. However, in the case of the Eaton fire, legal cases have been filed against the electrical company, Southern California Edison Company (SCE), claiming there is evidence that the blaze - one of the largest - was ignited due to negligence of the firm's overhead wires."}

On the cusp of international fame, the artist was leaving his mark - not only on the streets of his city, but on young people in Lawrence Weston. Here, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural. \"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building. \"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\" Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous. The artist would return to the club several times to create new works, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds – oblivious to who the artist would eventually become. It was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol. His friend had a suggestion – someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself. That person was Banksy. \"I got his phone number, so I used to call him up and ask if he'd come and do some art projects. He was really keen,\" Peter said. This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police. Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids. The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub. \"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society. \"It was always very vibrant.\" Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \"nobody thought twice about who he was\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston. He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said. \"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego. He was doing art with them, rather than doing art for them,\" he said. \"In the morning, he sat around a table with the children, talking about their ideas."}

Yoon, 64, is being investigated on charges of insurrection for a failed martial law order on 3 December that plunged the country into turmoil. He has also been impeached by parliament and suspended - but will only be removed from office if the Constitutional Court upholds the impeachment. However, Yoon's dramatic arrest on Wednesday brings to an end a weeks-long standoff between investigators and his presidential security team. Investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) failed to arrest him on 3 January after being locked in a six-hour stand-off with his security detail. But just before dawn on Wednesday, a much larger team of investigators and police arrived at his residence in central Seoul, armed with ladders to climb over buses blocking its entrance and bolt cutters to remove barbed wire. Other officers in the arrest team, which numbered around 1,000, scaled walls and hiked up nearby trails to reach the presidential residence. After several hours, authorities announced that Yoon had been arrested. In a three-minute video released just before his arrest, the 64-year-old leader said he would co-operate with the investigators, while repeating previous claims that the warrant was not legally valid. \"I decided to appear before the CIO, even though it is an illegal investigation, in order to prevent any unsavoury bloodshed,\" he said, adding that he witnessed officials \"invade\" his home's security perimeter with fire equipment. On Wednesday afternoon, investigators said Yoon had remained silent throughout questioning. Yoon's lawyers have said his arrest was \"illegal\" because the CIO, as an anti-corruption agency, has no power to investigate the insurrection allegations against Yoon. They also claim the warrant was issued by the wrong jurisdiction. The same court later dismissed an injunction filed by President Yoon to invalidate the arrest warrant, which the authorities maintain is lawful. The opposition Democratic Party's floor leader, Park Chan-dae, said Wednesday's arrest showed that \"justice in South Korea is alive\". This arrest \"is the first step toward restoring constitutional order, democracy and the rule of law\", he said during a party meeting. The country is currently being led by Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok as acting president. He was thrust into power after the first acting president,Han Duck-soo, was also impeachedby parliament, where the opposition has a sizeable majority. The clock has started ticking for investigators. Under the current warrant, they can hold Yoon for up to 48 hours from the point of arrest, after which they need a new warrant to detain him while he continues to be investigated. If that warrant is granted, they can detain him for up to 20 days before he is brought to trial. Without a new warrant, Yoon must be released."}

This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow whenKabul fell to the Taliban. Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns. Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban government expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\". Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports. How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me. \"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says. Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security. China, for example, has gone far: it has actively engaged with the Taliban government, focusing on security and economic interests, and even hasan ambassadorin the country. No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, but up to 40 countries maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with it. That's why experts like Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, are more circumspect about India's outreach. For the past three years, he says, India has maintained contact with the Taliban through a foreign service diplomat. India had closed its consulates in Afghanistan during the civil war in the 1990s and reopened them in 2002 after the war ended. \"We didn't want this hiatus to develop [again], so we wanted to engage. It is very simply a step up in relations,\" he says. India has\"historical and civilisational ties\" with Afghanistan, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament in 2023. India has invested more than $3bn (£2.46bn) in over 500 projects across Afghanistan, including roads, power lines, dams, hospitals and clinics. It has trained Afghan officers, awarded thousands of scholarships to students and built a new parliament building. This reflects a lasting geopolitical reality."}

There were reports of a breakthrough on Wednesday, with unnamed Israeli officials cited as saying that Hamas had agreed to the latest draft presented by Qatari, US and Egyptian mediators. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office however swiftly denied the reports. There was also no immediate comment from the Palestinian armed group. On Tuesday night, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said they were \"on the brink\" of an agreement and awaiting \"final word from Hamas\". A senior Hamas official later told Reuters news agency it had not delivered its official response to the draft because Israel had yet to submit maps showing how its troops would withdraw from areas of Gaza. However, Israel's Haaretz newspaper cited an Israeli source as denying Hamas's claim about the maps. The proposed three-phase deal would begin with an initial six-week ceasefire. A Palestinian official told the BBC that Hamas would release three hostages on the first day of a deal, after which Israel would begin withdrawing troops from populated areas. More hostage releases would then be staggered over the following weeks, he said, with Israel allowing displaced residents to return in northern areas. Israel has said it expects 33 hostages to be released in the first phase and that it will free a yet to be determined number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails in return. Negotiations for the second phase - which should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli troop withdrawal and a \"sustainable calm\" - would start after two weeks. Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman said on Tuesday that there were no major issues were blocking a deal and that he was hopeful the talks would \"very soon lead to an agreement\". However, he also warned that that \"the most minor detail\" could yet undermine the process. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 46,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of the 2.3 million population has also been displaced, there is widespread destruction, and there are severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter due to an struggle to get aid to those in need. Israel says 94 of the hostages are still being held by Hamas, of whom 34 are presumed dead. In addition, there are four Israelis who were abducted before the war, two of whom are dead. Relatives of the remaining hostages have urged the Israeli government to do whatever it takes to get a deal over the line and bring all of them home. \"We can't miss this moment. This is the last moment; we can save them,\" said Hadas Kalderon, the wife of Ofer Kalderon, a 54-year-old. Palestinians also dared to hope that an end to the devastating 15-month war was close."}

Winds that have fanned wildfires in the US city of Los Angeles are again expected to kick up on Wednesday - after a 25th death from the huge, week-long outbreak was confirmed. Forecasters have again identified an area of \"extreme fire danger\", emphasising the risk level in a region to the north-west of the city centre. In some mountainous areas, it is possible for winds to reach speeds of 70mph (113km/h), which would be nearly hurricane-force if they are sustained. The anticipated increase in speeds threatens to spread the remaining four blazes, which firefighters have made further progress in tackling during a few days of calmer conditions. Wind speeds began a slow and steady climb on Wednesday morning in parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. They are expected to peak during the day on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Compared with last week's conditions, winds are \"weaker but still strong\", the NWS cautions. There are hopes of another drop over the subsequent days - but officials have highlighted the need for rain that would help fire crews in their battle. \"The anticipated winds combined with low humidities and low fuel moistures will keep the fire threat in the LA region critical,\" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said during a news conference on Tuesday. Areas to the north-west of Los Angeles - including Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks - have been deemed to be particularly dangerous. An improvement in conditions is forecast later on Thursday and into Friday, says BBC Weather forecaster Sarah Keith-Lucas. But no rainfall is forecast for at least the next week - and the Santa Ana winds that have been blamed for stoking the blazes could again develop from Sunday. The fire chief for the city of Pasadena echoed the need for precipitation. There had been no \"real rain in southern California\" for more than 250 days, Chad Augustin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. His firefighters would spent Wednesday on \"standing guard ready to ensure that we hold our containment lines and we don't burn up any more structures\", Mr Augustin added. An extreme weather attribution study from climate scientists at 'Climameter' has concluded that the Californian wildfires have been fuelled by meteorological conditions strengthened by human-induced climate change. The study found that current conditions have been warmer, drier and windier compared with the past, in the areas affected by the fires. The 25th death from the fires was confirmed by the LA County Medical Examiner's Office. Thirteen other people remain missing. Most of the victims have died in the Eaton Fire, which has burned more than 14,000 acres to the city's north, but has now been 35% contained by firefighters. Further west, the larger Palisades Fire has torched more than 23,000 acres, and is now at 18% containment. Two smaller fires also continue to burn. Some of the victims of the Eaton Fire have now been allowed to return to their homes, although officials say they have no firm date for repopulation of the Palisades area, an upmarket area ravaged by the fire to which it lent its name."}

Efforts were made to get the treaty signed before President-elect Trump's inauguration on Monday, the BBC understands, and it had been expected the Mauritian cabinet would approve the proposal on Wednesday. The UK plans to hand over sovereignty of the cluster of islands in the Indian Ocean, but to maintain a 99-year lease over the joint UK and US military airbase on the largest island, Diego Garcia. A spokesman for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"perfectly reasonable for the US administration to consider the detail\" of any agreement. The deal has drawn criticism from politicians in the UK as well as the incoming US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said it poses a \"serious threat\" to US security. Reports had suggested Mauritian Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam would sign off the deal on Wednesday as he attended a cabinet meeting, but it was later announced his attorney general was travelling to London to continue talks. The UK took control of the Chagos Islands, or British Indian Ocean Territory, from its then colony, Mauritius, in 1965 and went on to evict its population of more than 1,000 people to make way for the Diego Garcia base. Mauritius, which won independence from the UK in 1968, has maintained that the islands are its own, and the UN's highest court has ruled, in an advisory opinion, that the UK's administration of the territory is \"unlawful\". At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir defended his plan, insisting it was the best way to safeguard the military base. However, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the prime minister was \"negotiating a secret deal to surrender British territory and taxpayers in this country will pay for the humiliation\". Badenoch said there was \"no way we should be giving up British territory in Chagos\" and claimed Sir Keir was \"rushing a deal which will be disastrous\".

She had referred herself to the prime minister's standards adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, after questions about links to her aunt, who was ousted last year as Bangladesh's prime minister. Sir Laurie said he had \"not identified evidence of improprieties\" but it was \"regrettable\" that Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of the ties to her aunt. Siddiq said continuing in her role would be \"a distraction\" for the government but insisted she had done nothing wrong. Before her resignation was announced, Siddiq had been named in a second investigation in Bangladesh. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said the prime minister \"dithered and delayed to protect\" her. Writing on X, she said: \"It was clear at the weekend that the anti-corruption minister's position was completely untenable. Yet Keir Starmer dithered and delayed to protect his close friend. \"Even now, as Bangladesh files a criminal case against Tulip Siddiq, he expresses 'sadness' at her inevitable resignation. \"Weak leadership from a weak prime minister.\" In a letter accepting Siddiq's resignation, Sir Keir said the \"door remains open\" for her. Siddiq, whose role as Economic Secretary to the Treasuryincluded tackling corruption in UK financial markets,was named last month in an investigation into claims her family embezzled up to £3.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh. Her aunt is the former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, head of the Awami League, who fled into exile after being deposed last year. Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, also came under intense scrutiny over her use of properties in London linked to her aunt's allies. TheFinancial Times reportedthat one of the properties, a flat in King's Cross, had been given to her by a person connected with the recently ousted Bangladeshi government. According to the Mail on Sunday, in 2022 Siddiq had denied the flat was a gift and insisted her parents had bought it for her and had threatened the paper with legal action preventing publication of a story. Labour sources subsequently told the newspaper the flat had been gifted to Siddiq by a property developer with alleged links to her aunt. Sir Laurie spent eight days investigating the allegations after Siddiq referred herself to the standards watchdog. In his letter, Sir Laurie said Siddiq \"acknowledges that, over an extended period, she was unaware of the origins of her ownership of her flat in Kings Cross, despite having signed a Land Registry transfer form relating to the gift at the time\". He said the MP \"remained under the impression that her parents had given the flat to her, having purchased it from the previous owner\". This had led to the public being \"inadvertently misled\" about the identity of the donor of the flat, added Sir Laurie. Sir Laurie said this was an \"unfortunate misunderstanding\" which had led to Siddiq issuing a public correction of \"the origins of her ownership after she became a minister\"."}

They say the man also tried to get them to sign waivers which stated they did not accuse anyone of \"criminal wrongdoing\". The 11 survivors who have spoken to the BBC have also accused the Egyptian authorities of trying to cover up what happened, saying investigators were determined to blame it on a huge wave. The Sea Story had been carrying 46 people when it sank in the early hours of 25 November last year - four bodies were recovered and seven people are still missing, including two British divers. Neither the Egyptian government nor the boat operators - Dive Pro Liveaboard, based in Hurghada - have responded to our questions. On Tuesday,the BBC revealed multiple accusations from survivors of safety failingson board the vessel. A leading oceanographer who analysed weather data also said it was not plausible that a huge wave had hit the vessel. Within hours of being brought ashore, survivors say they were subjected to what one described as \"an interrogation\", some from their hospital beds, by people they were told were judges. Those who didn't need hospital treatment were interviewed at a nearby resort, said other survivors, who reported the same feelings of being pressured. \"We were told we couldn't leave the room until they'd done everybody's statements,\" says Sarah Martin, an NHS doctor from Lancashire. The judges were part of an Egyptian investigation into what caused the sinking - though survivors say it was not clear exactly who was leading it. The survivors say having their initial statements translated into Arabic by an employee of the company that owned the Sea Story was a clear conflict of interest. Spanish diver Hissora Gonzalez said the man did not initially introduce himself as an employee. \"He just said, 'You have to tell me what happened, and then you have to sign this piece of paper.'\" It was not until later, say several people we spoke to, that the man told them he worked for Dive Pro Liveaboard. The survivors say that, after being translated by the man, their statements were handed to investigators - something that shocked Lisa Wolf. \"A normal judge can't take a translation from someone that's obviously totally involved in the process.\" One survivor, who is a Norwegian police investigator, said she had \"no clue\" what the four pages of Arabic handed back to her actually said. \"They could have written anything. I don't know what I signed,\" Frøydis Adamson explained. Under her signature she says she wrote that she had not been able to read the documents. \"We were in such shock and just wanted to go home,\" said Hissora. Representatives of the boat operators, Dive Pro Liveaboard, also repeatedly tried to push people into signing waivers - say survivors - which would have seen them agreeing to the statement: \"I do not accuse anyone of any criminal wrongdoing."}

It is followed closely by Netflix's Spanish-language musical Emilia Pérez, which tells the story of a Mexican cartel leader who leaves the world of crime to live a new life as a transgender woman. The frontrunners in the Bafta acting categories include Cynthia Erivo and Demi Moore for lead actress and Adrien Brody and Timothee Chalamet for lead actor. But Denzel Washington and Daniel Craig failed to make the shortlist for Gladiator II and Queer respectively. Hugh Grant's nomination in the lead actor category for horror film Heretic, and Saoirse Ronan as leading actress for The Outrun, are among some of the surprises. Jamie Lee Curtis is nominated in the supporting actress category for The Last Showgirl, but the film's main actress Pamela Anderson, who plays an ageing Las Vegas performer, missed out on a nomination. The leading films in the Bafta nominations 12 nominations - Conclave 11 - Emilia Pérez 9 - The Brutalist 7 - Anora, Dune: Part Two and Wicked 6 - A Complete Unknown and Kneecap 5 - Nosferatu and The Substance Another film tipped for success in the current awards season is Anora, which has seven Bafta nominations including best film. It follows the whirlwind romance between a New York sex worker and the son of a wealthy Russian oligarch. Mikey Madison is nominated as leading actress and is also up for the rising star award, which is voted for by the public. Her co-star Yura Borisov is nominated for best supporting actor, and director Sean Baker has his first Bafta best director nomination. Half of those nominated in the best director category are first-time nominees and also include The Brutalist's Brady Corbet, who won the same award at the Golden Globes. The film, about a Hungarian architect who is hired by a wealthy American after World War Two, has nine nods in total and is also tipped to be a big contender at the Oscars. The Substance director Coralie Fargeat is another first-time directing nominee and is the only female nominated in the category. Demi Moore is nominated for best actress for the film, weeks after winning at the Golden Globes - putting her in a strong position for the Oscars. Conclave's Edward Berger is also nominated for best director, and thanked the \"wonderful crew\" who helped the film earn 12 nominations. He had found \"a team of like-minded people who bond together to strive for the unattainable goal - perfection\", he said. British actress Marianne Jean-Baptiste's nomination in the same category for playing an irritable woman struggling with depression in Hard Truths has boosted momentum for her to receive an Oscar nomination. The Bafta shortlist is often a strong indicator for the Oscars, and last year the winners of the top six categories matched perfectly at the two ceremonies. Another Oscar-tipped film is A Complete Unknown, which follows Bob Dylan's rise to fame in the 1960s."}

Ever\". The 64-year-old was accused on Monday of sexual misconduct by eight women, including four who had previously spoken out. On Tuesday, in a blog post titled Breaking The Silence, Gaiman said he had read the allegations with \"horror and dismay\". He wrote: \"I've stayed quiet until now, both out of respect for the people who were sharing their stories and out of a desire not to draw even more attention to a lot of misinformation.\" He continued: \"I've always tried to be a private person, and felt increasingly that social media was the wrong place to talk about important personal matters. I've now reached the point where I feel that I should say something. \"As I read through this latest collection of accounts, there are moments I half-recognise and moments I don't, descriptions of things that happened sitting beside things that emphatically did not happen. \"I'm far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.\" The fantasy graphic novel and science-fiction writer - whose books Good Omens, American Gods and The Sandman have been adapted for television - was the subject of a New York Magazine cover story on Monday. The magazine and its website Vulture reported allegations from eight women, four of whom also previously accused Gaiman of sexual assault in July 2024 on a Tortoise Media podcast. One of the women, who had been babysitting Gaiman's five-year-old child, alleged that he offered her a bath in his garden before joining her in the tub naked, asking her to sit on his lap, and that he sexually assaulted her. The British author said he read back text messages from the time of the alleged incidents and felt they were \"of two people enjoying entirely consensual sexual relationships\". \"At the time I was in those relationships, they seemed positive and happy on both sides,\" he wrote. He acknowledged that he was \"careless with people's hearts and feelings\" and could have \"done so much better\", but said he doesn't \"accept there was any abuse\". The author said he understood that \"not everyone will believe me\" and added he would be \"doing my very best to deserve their trust, as well as the trust of my readers\". He claimed some of the allegations \"simply never happened\" while others had been \"distorted\" to \"bear no relationship to reality\", but said he would \"take responsibility for any missteps I made\". A police report accusing Gaiman of a sexual assault was made in January 2023, but the investigation was eventually dropped. Since the allegations surfaced, several of Gaiman's film and TV projects have been affected. Season three of Prime Video's Good Omens will now comprise one 90-minute episode, with Gaiman no longer involved. Disney has paused production on its film adaptation of another Gaiman title, The Graveyard Book, while Netflix has cancelled Dead Boy Detectives, although it's not clear if this was related to the allegations."}

The findings come as negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appear to be nearing a breakthrough. Mediators in Qatar say talks are in their final stages, raising hopes that an agreement could be reached soon. The \"humanitarian zone\" was first established by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in October 2023 toprotect civilians and keep them out of harms way. On 6 May 2024, the IDF significantly expanded the zone to include the cities of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah. The area - much of which is a strip of land along the Mediterranean sea - is densely populated and is estimated to have over a million people living there according to international humanitarian organisations. Many people are living in tents, with limited infrastructure and limited access to aid. Local media reports indicate more than 550 people have been killed in the 97 strikes mapped by BBC Verify. In a statement to BBC Verify, the IDF said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating in the \"humanitarian zone\" and accused the group of violating international law while \"exploiting\" civilians as human shields and launching rockets from the area. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's 7 October 2023 attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. The conflict has caused widespread damage to infrastructure across Gaza, with satellite images showing areas flattened by Israeli strikes. The Hamas-run health ministry also says more than 46,600 people have been killed within the enclave since the start of the war. BBC Verify analysis suggests that attacks within the \"humanitarian zone\" have intensified since May 2024, with at least 22 strikes already recorded so far this month. We also cannot confirm that all incidents are the result of IDF attacks. Locations of strikes documented by BBC Verify were provided to the IDF but they did not confirm or deny their involvement. Israeli military officials have only publicly acknowledged 28 attacks since 6 May. Israel historically has not publicly acknowledged every strike it has carried out in Gaza. Gavin Kelleher, an access manager in Gaza for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said there were \"near daily\" strikes within the zone, including from Israeli ships and quadcopters, or small drones. He added that \"heavy fire is recurrent in this area despite its [Israel's] unilateral 'humanitarian' designation.\" \"The Israeli military appears keen to maintain the illusion of a Humanitarian Zone that remains a certain size, yet that zone can be subject to 'evacuation orders' at any time and be targeted,\" Mr Kelleher said. One resident who lives within the zone, Khaled Abdel Rahman, told the BBC that residents were being subjected to daily bombardments, frequently resulting in injuries and casualties. \"We were displaced to Khan Younis because it was designated as a safe zone, but in fact we find nothing here but insecurity,\" Mr Rahman said."}

Photos of him and stories of people who have met him are incredibly rare. But now a man who got the secretive artist to work with children at a youth club in the late 1990s has given the BBC an exclusive insight into the man behind the murals, just as he was about to become famous. Banksy is one of the world's most famous graffiti artists. His work has sold for millions of pounds and his exhibitions seen by hundreds of thousands of people. But behind layers of paint, lost in time at a Bristol youth club, there's a Banksy very few people know about. On the cusp of international fame, the artist was leaving his mark - not only on the streets of his city, but on young people in Lawrence Weston. Here, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural. \"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building. \"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\" Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous. The artist would return to the club several times to create new works, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds – oblivious to who the artist would eventually become. It was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol. His friend had a suggestion – someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself. That person was Banksy. \"I got his phone number, so I used to call him up and ask if he'd come and do some art projects. He was really keen,\" Peter said. This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police. Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids. The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub. \"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society. \"It was always very vibrant.\" Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \"nobody thought twice about who he was\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston. He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said. \"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego. He was doing art with them, rather than doing art for them,\" he said. \"In the morning, he sat around a table with the children, talking about their ideas."}

Inauguration day includes a formal swearing-in ceremony as well as musical performances, a celebratory parade and a number of formal balls. Vice-President-elect JD Vance will also take the oath of office, joining Trump on stage to officially begin their new administration. The inauguration is the formal ceremony that marks the end of one president's time in office and the start of their successor's administration. It is the most high-profile part of the transition of power between government leaders in Washington DC. A key part of the ceremony includes the president-elect reciting the oath of office: \"I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" Though he won the election in November, Trump officially becomes the 47th president once he says those words. He previously served as the 45th president between 2017 and 2021. Vance will also take an oath of office before he formally assumes the position of vice-president. Trump's second inauguration day will kick off with a service at St. John's Church, Lafayette Square, a historic Washington DC church, followed by tea at the White House. Musical performances and opening remarks are set to begin on the main event stage - located on the West Lawn of the US Capitol building - at 09:30 EST (14:30 GMT). That will be followed by the swearing-in of Trump and Vance as well as the inaugural address in which the president will set out his goals for the next four years. Trump will then head inside to the President's Room - near the Senate chamber - to sign key documents. He will then attend a lunch hosted by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. This is followed by a parade which goes from the Capitol building down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Later in the evening, Trump will appear at three inaugural balls throughout the city - the Commander-in-Chief Ball, the Liberty Inaugural Ball and the Starlight Ball. He is expected to speak at all three. There is typically high demand to watch the inauguration in person, and tickets are highly sought after. Members of Congress receive a certain number of tickets to the ceremony, which they can distribute to their constituents. These tickets are free, but often challenging to get. Americans can contact their congressperson directly for tickets. If you're not able to attend in person, there are plenty of ways to watch remotely. The White House will livestream the inauguration. The BBC will carry inauguration coverage live on our news channel. You can also watch a stream of the inauguration on our website and follow our live page, where we'll bring you updates, analysis and key moments as they happen. Local and federal officials are expecting around 200,000 people to show up in Washington DC, which could include Trump supporters and protestors."}
{"Article Number": 208, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyng762q4eo", "Text": "TikTok will be banned in the US on 19 January - unless the Supreme Court accepts alast ditch legal bid fromits Chinese owner, ByteDance, that to do so would be unconstitutional. But even if the country's highest judicial authority agrees with the lower courts - and Congress - that the platform is a threat to national security will that actually stop Americans using it? Will there be ways to bypass the ban - or could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop a law he says he opposed to, even if the courts uphold it. And whatever happens to TikTok, who stands to benefit from the uncertainty clouding its future? The most likely way the US would ban TikTok is to order app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, to make it unavailable for download in that region. US lawmakers have already told  tech firms to be ready to remove the app from their stores if a ban comes into force. That would mean people could no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok - though it would also mean people who've already got it would still have it on their phones. Because the app would not be publicly available anymore, new updates could no longer be delivered to users in the US - which would make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable. Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target. Of course, there are ways around such a ban. There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region. The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements. It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks. However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app. So if the ban took this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to. There are still other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether. And even if people did use a VPN, there are still ways TikTok could theoretically judge whether a person is based in the US - and then simply present them with a screen saying the app is not available in their country. It remains to be seen whether TikTok would decide to assist the government in its own ban - but it is being reported by Reuters that it plans to do so. TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US unless it rules in its favour."}

This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow whenKabul fell to the Taliban. Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns. Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban government expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\". Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports. How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me. \"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says. Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security. China, for example, has gone far: it has actively engaged with the Taliban government, focusing on security and economic interests, and even hasan ambassadorin the country. No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, but up to 40 countries maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with it. That's why experts like Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, are more circumspect about India's outreach. For the past three years, he says, India has maintained contact with the Taliban through a foreign service diplomat. India had closed its consulates in Afghanistan during the civil war in the 1990s and reopened them in 2002 after the war ended. \"We didn't want this hiatus to develop [again], so we wanted to engage. It is very simply a step up in relations,\" he says. India has\"historical and civilisational ties\" with Afghanistan, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament in 2023. India has invested more than $3bn (£2.46bn) in over 500 projects across Afghanistan, including roads, power lines, dams, hospitals and clinics. It has trained Afghan officers, awarded thousands of scholarships to students and built a new parliament building. This reflects a lasting geopolitical reality."}

In a memo to staff, boss Mark Zuckerberg said he had made the decision to speed up the firm's regular performance-based cuts in anticipation of an \"intense year\". He said the company would \"backfill\" the roles later in 2025. The company, which employs about 72,000 people globally, did not say how the cuts would be distributed around the world. Workers in the US who are affected will know by 10 February, according to Mr Zuckerberg's memo. Those outside the US will be informed \"later\". \"This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams,\" he wrote. \"I've decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster.\" The move comes on the heels of other big decisions by Mr Zuckerberg, including moves to end the company's fact-checking and diversity programmes. Performance-based job cuts are common in corporate America. At Meta, they would normally unfold over the course of a year, Mr Zuckerberg said, but the process is being accelerated this year. Roughly 3,600 people could be affected this move. They will receive \"generous severance\", he said. The last big cuts at Meta came in 2023, when the companycut about 10,000 positionsin a cost-cutting drive after Mr Zuckerberg declared it the \"year of efficiency\". Itcut about 11,000 roles in 2022. Mr Zuckerberg also appears to be overhauling his own public image. On a recent podcast with Joe Rogan, Mr Zuckerberg said he thought companies needed more \"masculine energy\" and discussed taking up martial arts, which he said he enjoyed because he felt he could more fully express himself, than in his corporate role. \"When you're running a company, people typically don't wanna see you being like this ruthless person who's just like I'm gonna crush the people I'm competing with,\" he said. \"But when you're fighting, it's like no.\" \"I think in some ways when people see me competing in the sport they're like oh no, 'That's the real Mark.\" In an exclusive interview, Ian Russell tells the BBC that he believes there is \"no real movement\" within government on online safety.

She had referred herself to the prime minister's standards adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, after questions about links to her aunt, who was ousted last year as Bangladesh's prime minister. Sir Laurie said he had \"not identified evidence of improprieties\" but it was \"regrettable\" that Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of the ties to her aunt. Siddiq said continuing in her role would be \"a distraction\" for the government but insisted she had done nothing wrong. Before her resignation was announced, Siddiq had been named in a second investigation in Bangladesh. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said the prime minister \"dithered and delayed to protect\" her. Writing on X, she said: \"It was clear at the weekend that the anti-corruption minister's position was completely untenable. Yet Keir Starmer dithered and delayed to protect his close friend. \"Even now, as Bangladesh files a criminal case against Tulip Siddiq, he expresses 'sadness' at her inevitable resignation. \"Weak leadership from a weak prime minister.\" In a letter accepting Siddiq's resignation, Sir Keir said the \"door remains open\" for her. Siddiq, whose role as Economic Secretary to the Treasuryincluded tackling corruption in UK financial markets,was named last month in an investigation into claims her family embezzled up to £3.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh. Her aunt is the former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, head of the Awami League, who fled into exile after being deposed last year. Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, also came under intense scrutiny over her use of properties in London linked to her aunt's allies. TheFinancial Times reportedthat one of the properties, a flat in King's Cross, had been given to her by a person connected with the recently ousted Bangladeshi government. According to the Mail on Sunday, in 2022 Siddiq had denied the flat was a gift and insisted her parents had bought it for her and had threatened the paper with legal action preventing publication of a story. Labour sources subsequently told the newspaper the flat had been gifted to Siddiq by a property developer with alleged links to her aunt. Sir Laurie spent eight days investigating the allegations after Siddiq referred herself to the standards watchdog. In his letter, Sir Laurie said Siddiq \"acknowledges that, over an extended period, she was unaware of the origins of her ownership of her flat in Kings Cross, despite having signed a Land Registry transfer form relating to the gift at the time\". He said the MP \"remained under the impression that her parents had given the flat to her, having purchased it from the previous owner\". This had led to the public being \"inadvertently misled\" about the identity of the donor of the flat, added Sir Laurie. Sir Laurie said this was an \"unfortunate misunderstanding\" which had led to Siddiq issuing a public correction of \"the origins of her ownership after she became a minister\"."}
{"Article Number": 219, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyv433le3vno", "Text": "Drake has scrapped a legal case against Universal Music and Spotify, in which he accused the companies of conspiring to boost the streams of Kendrick Lamar's diss track against him, Not Like Us. The Canadian startook action last November, alleging that the music companies had used bots, payola and other methods to promote Lamar's song, which accused him of paedophilia. \"The record-shattering spread of Not Like Us on streaming, sales, and radio play was deliberate and appears to have relied upon irregular and inappropriate business practices,\" court documents alleged. However, on Tuesday, Drake's lawyers voluntarily withdrew a pre-action filing, effectively ending the case. According to court documents filed in New York, the star met with representatives of Spotify and Universal on Tuesday to discuss the case. Spotify, which had filed an opposition, had no objection to the withdrawal and discontinuance. Universal, which hadn't filed an opposition, reserved its position. A related case, filed against Universal and radio network iHeartRadio in Texas, is still active.  Not Like Us was widely regarded as the decisive blow in a long-running feud between Drake and Lamar, which dates back to the early 2010s. In the lyrics, Lamar alleges that Drake \"likes 'em young\" and accuses him of using other, more credible rappers, to boost his profile. Around 24 hours later, Drake responded with a track called The Heart Part 6, where he rejected the allegations, saying, \"I never been with no one under age\". He also  claimed to have fed Lamar \"false\" information through a double agent. However, his retort failed to attract the same attention as Not Like Us, which debuted at number one in the US chart and attracted more than 1 billion streams on Spotify. Taking to the courts, Drake accused Universal - which distributes both his music and Lamar's - of artificially boosting the song's numbers. In court documents, he claimed that the label licensed the song \"at drastically reduced rates to Spotify\" and used bots to stream the song, generating \"the false impression that the song was more popular than it was in reality\".  The papers were not a lawsuit, but a \"pre-action petition\", in which Drake's lawyers sought to gain access to internal documents at Spotify and Universal which might have supported their case. In a statement at the time, Universal told the BBC: \"The suggestion that [the company] would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue. \"We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns. No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\" Spotify also responded that there was \"no economic incentive for users to stream Not Like Us over any of Drake's tracks\". The Swedish streaming company later filed an opposition brief to Drake's petition, stating that it \"should be denied\". Music industry experts had been sceptical that the accusations would ever reach trial."}

Some horses came solo, others in trailers packed with fellow animals. Many had their owners, but others arrived alone, brought in by their rescuers or animal control. Pigs, donkeys and miniature horses followed. Within 24 hours, the Los Angeles Equestrian Center had been transformed into a modern-day Noah's Ark. Over the last week, it has sheltered hundreds of animals from the disaster as part of its official role as one of the city's large animal shelters. The facility, tucked in the shadow of Griffith Park, has taken in more than 200 horses, on top of the roughly 500 already living there.  Last Tuesday and Wednesday were \"chaos\", said Jennie Nevin, a spokeswoman for the equestrian centre. The facility catalogued every horse that arrived, making sure they could be reunited. Sheltering the animals came at no cost for the owners, thanks to the support of public donations and frequent drop-offs of free hay, feed and other supplies. Sergio Marcial was one of dozens of people who brought animals here after their own facilities were destroyed or threatened. A week ago, he and his girlfriend Jenny Bacon raced to help rescue more than 70 animals from theEaton Dam Stables while battling flames so intense that his face mask caught fire and his eyeglasses shattered and warped. His efforts landed him in the hospital, his lungs and throat burned after inhaling the torched air. One week later, Mr Marcial, 29, and Ms Bacon, 30, walked Arthur and Playboy - two miniature horses he helped save that night - around their new home. Here, they were safe from the fires, and they seemed calm and friendly despite everything they had endured. \"It still hurts to swallow,\" Mr Marcial said, pointing to a face mask he's required to wear to prevent infections. \"I'd do it all again - no question.\" Most of the sheltered animals' owners have been identified, and several owners spent Tuesday afternoon walking their horses around the stables. Dozens of volunteers cared for the other animals staying at the centre. Some had become local celebrities. Two donkeys, Morris and Mika, frequently poked their heads out of their stables to demand attention. They had fled down the mountain with their owner as the Palisades fire drew near, and were reunited because he had spray-painted his number on to their sides. \"They love for you to sing to them,\" said volunteer Lucena Herrera. \"We've all just been adopting them and taking care of them.\" But a handful of animals still have not been claimed. A miniature horse named Izzy had still not found her owner a week after the fires. The volunteers had collectively adopted her until she could find a new, permanent home.  So many volunteers showed up to help the animals that the staff had to turn some away, Ms Nevin said. Between 50-100 volunteers now raked stalls, fed the animals, fluffed hay and serenaded Morris and Mika when they grew antsy."}

Public Service Cabinet Secretary Justin Muturi said that it took a call by President William Ruto to have his son released by the National Intelligence Service (NIS). Muturi is the first member of the cabinet to publicly criticise the government's handling of the spate of abductions in Kenya. In a statement to the police crime investigations unit on Tuesday, Muturi gave a detailed account of how his son, Leslie, was abducted on 22 June last year. Mr Ruto and the intelligence agency have not commented on his allegations. At least 80 people, including the minister's son, have been abducted in the last six months, according to a state-funded rights group. The wave of abductions started after protests against tax hikes last June, and have continued since then. Some of those abducted have been released following public pressure. Earlier this week, the minister told journalists that he had not received answers about the abduction of his son, despite reaching out to top security officials. Muturi said the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) subsequently urged him to record a statement with them, telling him the matter was still under investigation. In his statement to the DCI, Muturi recalled calling the inspector-general of police, the interior minister, the DCI head, the head of the intelligence agency and other top officials as he desperately looked for his son – but, he added, all were unable to help. He said that he also messaged Ruto, but later decided to visit his official residence to raise the matter directly with him. \"I then narrated the ordeal [to the president] including my interactions with various senior government officials who had been unable to help. I expressed my belief that NIS was holding my son,\" Muturi said in the statement. He said that the president made a joke about the issue and then made a call to the head of the intelligence agency, who promised to release his son in an hour. \"I heard the president ask [NIS director] Noordin Haji if he was holding my son. [He] confirmed that indeed he was holding my son and the president instructed him to release Leslie immediately,\" Muturi added. Muturi has faced calls from some government-allied politicians to resign for publicly criticising the government in which he serves. Foreign nationals have also been abducted, including prominent Tanzanian activist Maria Sarungi Tsehai, who on Monday narrated how she was kidnapped by armed men and released several hours later. Last year, Ugandan opposition leader Kizza Besigye was kidnapped in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, allegedly by Ugandan security officials, and taken across the border for trial by a court martial. Muturi's public mentioning of Ruto's name in connection with abductions is a defiant challenge to the president, and is seen as being against the principle of collective responsibility in government."}

{"Article Number": 224, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg45zqz225vo", "Text": "Yoon Suk Yeol has become South Korea's first sitting president to be arrested after investigators scaled barricades and cut through barbed wire to take him into custody. Yoon, 64, is being investigated on charges of insurrection for a failed martial law order on 3 December that plunged the country into turmoil. He has also been impeached by parliament and suspended - but will only be removed from office if the Constitutional Court upholds the impeachment. However, Yoon's dramatic arrest on Wednesday brings to an end a weeks-long standoff between investigators and his presidential security team. Investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) failed to arrest him on 3 January after being locked in a six-hour stand-off with his security detail. But just before dawn on Wednesday, a much larger team of investigators and police arrived at his residence in central Seoul, armed with ladders to climb over buses blocking its entrance and bolt cutters to remove barbed wire. Other officers in the arrest team, which numbered around 1,000, scaled walls and hiked up nearby trails to reach the presidential residence. After several hours, authorities announced that Yoon had been arrested. In a three-minute video released just before his arrest, the 64-year-old leader said he would co-operate with the investigators, while repeating previous claims that the warrant was not legally valid. \"I decided to appear before the CIO, even though it is an illegal investigation, in order to prevent any unsavoury bloodshed,\" he said, adding that he witnessed officials \"invade\" his home's security perimeter with fire equipment. On Wednesday afternoon, investigators said Yoon had remained silent throughout questioning. Yoon's lawyers have said his arrest was \"illegal\" because the CIO, as an anti-corruption agency, has no power to investigate the insurrection allegations against Yoon. They also claim the warrant was issued by the wrong jurisdiction. The same court later dismissed an injunction filed by President Yoon to invalidate the arrest warrant, which the authorities maintain is lawful. The opposition Democratic Party's floor leader, Park Chan-dae, said Wednesday's arrest showed that \"justice in South Korea is alive\". This arrest \"is the first step toward restoring constitutional order, democracy and the rule of law\", he said during a party meeting. The country is currently being led by Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok as acting president. He was thrust into power after the first acting president,Han Duck-soo, was also impeachedby parliament, where the opposition has a sizeable majority. The clock has started ticking for investigators. Under the current warrant, they can hold Yoon for up to 48 hours from the point of arrest, after which they need a new warrant to detain him while he continues to be investigated. If that warrant is granted, they can detain him for up to 20 days before he is brought to trial. Without a new warrant, Yoon must be released."}

Forecasters have again identified an area of \"extreme fire danger\", emphasising the risk level in a region to the north-west of the city centre. In some mountainous areas, it is possible for winds to reach speeds of 70mph (113km/h), which would be nearly hurricane-force if they are sustained. The anticipated increase in speeds threatens to spread the remaining four blazes, which firefighters have made further progress in tackling during a few days of calmer conditions. Wind speeds began a slow and steady climb on Wednesday morning in parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. They are expected to peak during the day on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Compared with last week's conditions, winds are \"weaker but still strong\", the NWS cautions. There are hopes of another drop over the subsequent days - but officials have highlighted the need for rain that would help fire crews in their battle. \"The anticipated winds combined with low humidities and low fuel moistures will keep the fire threat in the LA region critical,\" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said during a news conference on Tuesday. Areas to the north-west of Los Angeles - including Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks - have been deemed to be particularly dangerous. An improvement in conditions is forecast later on Thursday and into Friday, says BBC Weather forecaster Sarah Keith-Lucas. But no rainfall is forecast for at least the next week - and the Santa Ana winds that have been blamed for stoking the blazes could again develop from Sunday. The fire chief for the city of Pasadena echoed the need for precipitation. There had been no \"real rain in southern California\" for more than 250 days, Chad Augustin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. His firefighters would spent Wednesday on \"standing guard ready to ensure that we hold our containment lines and we don't burn up any more structures\", Mr Augustin added. An extreme weather attribution study from climate scientists at 'Climameter' has concluded that the Californian wildfires have been fuelled by meteorological conditions strengthened by human-induced climate change. The study found that current conditions have been warmer, drier and windier compared with the past, in the areas affected by the fires. The 25th death from the fires was confirmed by the LA County Medical Examiner's Office. Thirteen other people remain missing. Most of the victims have died in the Eaton Fire, which has burned more than 14,000 acres to the city's north, but has now been 35% contained by firefighters. Further west, the larger Palisades Fire has torched more than 23,000 acres, and is now at 18% containment. Two smaller fires also continue to burn. Some of the victims of the Eaton Fire have now been allowed to return to their homes, although officials say they have no firm date for repopulation of the Palisades area, an upmarket area ravaged by the fire to which it lent its name."}

This is better for patients than relying only on body mass index (BMI) - which measures whether they are a healthy weight for their height - to determine obesity. More than a billion people are estimated to beliving with obesity worldwideand prescription weight-loss drugs are in high demand. The report, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, is supported by more than 50 medical experts around the world.  \"Some individuals with obesity can maintain normal organ function and overall health, even long term, whereas others display signs and symptoms of severe illness here and now,\" Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, who chaired the expert group, said. \"Obesity is a spectrum,\" he added. The current, blanket definition means too many people are being diagnosed as obese but not receiving the most appropriate care, the report says. Natalie, from Crewe, goes to the gym four times a week and has a healthy diet, but is still overweight. \"I would consider myself on the larger side, but I'm fit,\" she told the BBC 5 Live phone-in with Nicky Campbell. \"If you look at my BMI I'm obese, but if I speak to my doctor they say that I'm fit, healthy and there's nothing wrong with me. \"I'm doing everything I can to stay fit and have a long healthy life,\" she said. Richard, from Falmouth, said there is a lot of confusion around BMI. \"When they did my test, it took me to a level of borderline obesity, but my body fat was only 4.9% - the problem is I had a lot of muscle mass,\" he says. In Mike's opinion, you cannot be fat and fit - he says it is all down to diet. \"All these skinny jabs make me laugh, if you want to lose weight stop eating - it's easy.\" Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as havinga BMI over 30- a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight. It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared. For example, if they are 70kg (about 11 stone) and 1.70m (about 5ft 7in): Find out what your body mass index (BMI) means on the NHS website But BMI has limitations. It measures whether someone is carrying too much weight - but not too much fat. So very muscular people, such as athletes, tend to have a high BMI but not much fat. The report says BMI is useful on a large scale, to work out the proportion of a population who are a healthy weight, overweight or obese. But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs. Measuring a patient's waists or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says."}

This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow whenKabul fell to the Taliban. Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns. Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban government expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\". Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports. How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me. \"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says. Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security. China, for example, has gone far: it has actively engaged with the Taliban government, focusing on security and economic interests, and even hasan ambassadorin the country. No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, but up to 40 countries maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with it. That's why experts like Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, are more circumspect about India's outreach. For the past three years, he says, India has maintained contact with the Taliban through a foreign service diplomat. India had closed its consulates in Afghanistan during the civil war in the 1990s and reopened them in 2002 after the war ended. \"We didn't want this hiatus to develop [again], so we wanted to engage. It is very simply a step up in relations,\" he says. India has\"historical and civilisational ties\" with Afghanistan, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament in 2023. India has invested more than $3bn (£2.46bn) in over 500 projects across Afghanistan, including roads, power lines, dams, hospitals and clinics. It has trained Afghan officers, awarded thousands of scholarships to students and built a new parliament building. This reflects a lasting geopolitical reality."}
{"Article Number": 228, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp5xe1zwgo", "Text": "Just before dawn on Wednesday, 3,000 police officers arrived at the heavily-fortified residence of South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol. Their mission: to arrest him. Investigators used ladders to scale over buses and bolt cutters to get through barbed wire as they broke through multiple blockades designed to stop them. Others hiked up nearby trails to reach the presidential residence. Hours later, they took him into custody for questioning over an alleged act of insurrection. This was their second attempt. Their first, which took place earlier this month, had seen some 150 officers face a six-hour deadlock with the president's security detail. They were helplessly outnumbered, first by the large number of pro-Yoon supporters who had gathered outside his residence to stop the police, and then by a human wall of security officers inside the property. Eventually, investigators concluded that it was \"practically impossible\" to arrest him - and left. Many now see Yoon as a disgraced leader - impeached and suspended from his presidential duties for trying to impose martial law, while heawaits the decision of the Constitutional Court, which can remove him from office. So why has it been so difficult to arrest him? It has been an unprecedented few weeks for South Korea since Yoon's shocking yet short-lived martial law order on 3 December. Lawmakers voted to impeach him, then came a criminal investigation and his refusal to appear for questioning, which was what sparked the arrest warrant. One key roadblock for the arresting officers had been Yoon's presidential security team, which on 3 January had formed a human wall and used vehicles to block the officers' path. Analysts said they could have acted out of loyalty to Yoon, pointing to the fact that Yoon himself had appointed several leaders of the Presidential Security Service (PSS). \"It may well be the case that Yoon has seeded the organisation with hardline loyalists in preparation for precisely this eventuality,\" says US-based lawyer and Korea expert Christopher Jumin Lee. It is unclear why they reportedly put up less resistance this time, though Mr Lee believes the team may have been partly deterred by the \"overwhelming show of force by the police\". \"At the end of the day I think they were simply unwilling to engage in the sort of large-scale violence against law enforcement officers that a full-throated defence of Yoon would have demanded,\" he said. Earlier this week, the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) had warned the PSS that they risked losing their pensions and their civil servant status for obstructing the arrest. In contrast, it reassured those who \"defy illegal orders\" to block the arrest that they \"will not face disadvantages\". On Wednesday, Yonhap news agency reported that a number of PSS members were either on leave or had chosen to stay inside the residence. The right-wing leader also has a strong support base. Some of Yoon's supporters had earlier told the BBC that they wereprepared to die to protect himand  repeated unfounded allegations that Yoon himself has floated, including that the country had been infiltrated by pro-North Korea forces."}

They say the man also tried to get them to sign waivers which stated they did not accuse anyone of \"criminal wrongdoing\". The 11 survivors who have spoken to the BBC have also accused the Egyptian authorities of trying to cover up what happened, saying investigators were determined to blame it on a huge wave. The Sea Story had been carrying 46 people when it sank in the early hours of 25 November last year - four bodies were recovered and seven people are still missing, including two British divers. Neither the Egyptian government nor the boat operators - Dive Pro Liveaboard, based in Hurghada - have responded to our questions. On Tuesday,the BBC revealed multiple accusations from survivors of safety failingson board the vessel. A leading oceanographer who analysed weather data also said it was not plausible that a huge wave had hit the vessel. Within hours of being brought ashore, survivors say they were subjected to what one described as \"an interrogation\", some from their hospital beds, by people they were told were judges. Those who didn't need hospital treatment were interviewed at a nearby resort, said other survivors, who reported the same feelings of being pressured. \"We were told we couldn't leave the room until they'd done everybody's statements,\" says Sarah Martin, an NHS doctor from Lancashire. The judges were part of an Egyptian investigation into what caused the sinking - though survivors say it was not clear exactly who was leading it. The survivors say having their initial statements translated into Arabic by an employee of the company that owned the Sea Story was a clear conflict of interest. Spanish diver Hissora Gonzalez said the man did not initially introduce himself as an employee. \"He just said, 'You have to tell me what happened, and then you have to sign this piece of paper.'\" It was not until later, say several people we spoke to, that the man told them he worked for Dive Pro Liveaboard. The survivors say that, after being translated by the man, their statements were handed to investigators - something that shocked Lisa Wolf. \"A normal judge can't take a translation from someone that's obviously totally involved in the process.\" One survivor, who is a Norwegian police investigator, said she had \"no clue\" what the four pages of Arabic handed back to her actually said. \"They could have written anything. I don't know what I signed,\" Frøydis Adamson explained. Under her signature she says she wrote that she had not been able to read the documents. \"We were in such shock and just wanted to go home,\" said Hissora. Representatives of the boat operators, Dive Pro Liveaboard, also repeatedly tried to push people into signing waivers - say survivors - which would have seen them agreeing to the statement: \"I do not accuse anyone of any criminal wrongdoing."}

Firefighters made progress over the weekend in containing the Palisades and Eaton fires but warn that the return of high winds - forecast until Wednesday - could see these two spread again, or fuel new ones. The fires are already among the most destructive in LA's history when measured by the number of buildings destroyed. Rebuilding work will cost \"tens of billions\" of dollars, US President Joe Biden has said. An area to the north-west of the city centre is described by officials as \"particularly dangerous\". A red flag warning - indicating a high level of fire danger - is in place until 18:00 (02:00 GMT) on Wednesday, with the strongest Santa Ana winds expected on Tuesday. Nearby, the largest fire is in the Palisades area, and has burnt through more than 23,000 acres. It is still only about 14% contained, despite the efforts of thousands of firefighters. The blaze is moving east, threatening the exclusive neighbourhood of Brentwood, home to the Getty Center, a world-famous art museum that has evacuated its staff. Another fire, Eaton, is more deadly than Palisades so far - responsible for 16 of the deaths. The overall destruction is immense, with more than 12,000 structures - homes, outbuildings, sheds, mobile homes and cars - destroyed. Celebrities Mel Gibson and Paris Hilton are among those who have lost their homes. Tens of thousands of homes are also without power. The fires could turn out to be the costliest in US history, with damage projected at up to $150bn, according to a preliminary estimate by AccuWeather. There are three active fires in the wider area, while a smaller fire is nearly contained, say California fire officials: The earlier Kenneth, Archer, Sunset, Lidia, Woodley and Olivasfires have been contained. Containment describes the progress firefighters make in controlling the spread of flames. It is often listed as a percentage. For example, if a fire is 14% contained, that means fire crews have established barriers around 14% of the fire's perimeter. Natural barriers include roads, rivers and oceans. Firefighters can also create barriers using equipment such as bulldozers, hoses and shovels to remove vegetation down to the bare soil, meaning there is nothing for the fire to burn. A fire being 100% contained doesn't mean it has been extinguished, but rather that the flames have been fully encircled and the spread has been effectively stopped. Detectives continue to investigate the possible causes. Lightning - the most common source of fires in the US - has been ruled out as a cause for the Palisades and Eaton fires. There has been no official indication so far that arson or utility lines - the next two biggest culprits in sparking fires - caused any of the conflagrations. However, in the case of the Eaton fire, legal cases have been filed against the electrical company, Southern California Edison Company (SCE), claiming there is evidence that the blaze - one of the largest - was ignited due to negligence of the firm's overhead wires."}

The changes, which are set to come into force from 27 January, are a U-turn from a policy introduced six years ago that allowed people to linger in Starbucks outlets and use their toilets without making a purchase. The move is part of the \"back to Starbucks\" strategy - a plan announced by the firm's new boss as he tries to tackle flagging sales. Starbucks said there was no change to its policy in the UK, where customers can continue to use the facilities without purchasing anything. The world's biggest coffee chain says its new code of conduct - which also addresses harassment and bans smoking and outside alcohol - aims to make its stores more welcoming. \"Implementing a Coffeehouse Code of Conduct... is a practical step that helps us prioritise our paying customers who want to sit and enjoy our cafes,\" a Starbucks spokesperson told BBC News. \"These updates are part of a broader set of changes we are making to enhance the cafe experience as we work to get back to Starbucks.\" The company said the new rules would be displayed at every store and staff would be instructed to ask anyone who violates the code of conduct to leave. That includes allowing employees to call the police when necessary. The change ends a policy Starbucks introduced in 2018 after two black men were arrested at one of the company's stores in Philadelphia. The men, one of whom had asked to use the toilet, had said they were waiting for a friend and refused a manager's request to leave. The video of the incident went viral, and critics accused the chain of racial profiling and called for a boycott. Starbucks apologised to the men, agreed a settlement, and to help counter the backlash announced it would welcome people into their cafes, whether or not they were customers. Starbucks has been trying to boost flagging sales as it grappled with a backlash to price increases and boycotts sparked by the Israel-Gaza war. Brian Niccol, who previously headed the Mexican food chain Chipotle, wasbrought into Starbucks last yearto help turn the business around. Mr Niccol has been trying to improve the customer experience at Starbucks' cafes byrevamping its menusand coffee shops.

{"Article Number": 232, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg45l9q62w4o", "Text": "Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's pick for defence secretary in his upcoming presidency, cleared his first hurdle on the way to confirmation: a long - and at times tense - hearing before the US Senate's Armed Services Committee. For more than four hours on Tuesday, Hegseth faced questions about his ability to run the defence department, including its three million employees and $849bn (£695bn) budget. And although he was grilled by Democrats overaccusations of sexual assault, infidelity and drinking in the workplace, he appears all but certain to be confirmed to the role after no Republicans came out against him. This was underscored later on Tuesday when Joni Ernst, one Republican who had been seen as a potential roadblock to his nomination, said she would support him. Here's a look at the five main takeaways from Hegseth's testimony. From the very start of his testimony,Hegseth, a military veteran,emphasised what he called a \"warrior culture\", vowing to return the focus of the defence department to the strength of America's military. \"Warfighting, lethality, meritocracy, standards, and readiness. That's it. That is my job,\" he said in his opening statements. As the hearing continued, Hegseth was critical of policies he felt harmed the efficiency and \"lethality\" of the military, namely efforts aimed at racial and gender diversity. \"This is not a time for equity,\" he said, adding that he opposes quotas, which he claims hurt morale. In what became an expectedly partisan hearing, Democrats repeatedly grilled Hegseth on his past statements suggesting women were not suited to serve in combat roles in the military. Questions along these lines from Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Mazie Hirono and Elizabeth Warren provided some of the most heated moments of the morning. He spoke over Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, as she tried to point to comments about female service members stretching back years. \"Mr Hegseth, I'm quoting you in a podcast: 'Women shouldn't be in combat at all',\" Warren said. Hegseth remained composed, responding by saying his concern was not women in combat, but simply maintaining \"standards\" in the military. Hegseth, who at 44 would be the youngest defence secretary in decades, also answered questions about his preparedness to run the defence department, a sprawling agency. The former Fox News host described himself as a \"change agent\", saying \"it's time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm.\" Some Republicans deemed Hegseth's lack of experience a strength. \"I just want to say for all the talk of experience and not coming from the same cocktail parties that permanent Washington is used to, you are a breath of fresh air,\" Senator Eric Schmitt, a Republican from Missouri, said. A graduate of Princeton and Harvard universities, Hegseth was an infantry platoon leader in Guantanamo Bay and Iraq, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. Hegseth, also a former Fox News TV host, has military experience in Afghanistan as well. Still, Democrats pressed Hegseth on his qualifications for the top military job."}

Photos of him and stories of people who have met him are incredibly rare. But now a man who got the secretive artist to work with children at a youth club in the late 1990s has given the BBC an exclusive insight into the man behind the murals, just as he was about to become famous. Banksy is one of the world's most famous graffiti artists. His work has sold for millions of pounds and his exhibitions seen by hundreds of thousands of people. But behind layers of paint, lost in time at a Bristol youth club, there's a Banksy very few people know about. On the cusp of international fame, the artist was leaving his mark - not only on the streets of his city, but on young people in Lawrence Weston. Here, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural. \"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building. \"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\" Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous. The artist would return to the club several times to create new works, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds – oblivious to who the artist would eventually become. It was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol. His friend had a suggestion – someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself. That person was Banksy. \"I got his phone number, so I used to call him up and ask if he'd come and do some art projects. He was really keen,\" Peter said. This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police. Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids. The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub. \"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society. \"It was always very vibrant.\" Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \"nobody thought twice about who he was\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston. He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said. \"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego. He was doing art with them, rather than doing art for them,\" he said. \"In the morning, he sat around a table with the children, talking about their ideas."}

{"Article Number": 270, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg45zqz225vo", "Text": "Yoon Suk Yeol has become South Korea's first sitting president to be arrested after investigators scaled barricades and cut through barbed wire to take him into custody. Yoon, 64, is being investigated on charges of insurrection for a failed martial law order on 3 December that plunged the country into turmoil. He has also been impeached by parliament and suspended - but will only be removed from office if the Constitutional Court upholds the impeachment. However, Yoon's dramatic arrest on Wednesday brings to an end a weeks-long standoff between investigators and his presidential security team. Investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) failed to arrest him on 3 January after being locked in a six-hour stand-off with his security detail. But just before dawn on Wednesday, a much larger team of investigators and police arrived at his residence in central Seoul, armed with ladders to climb over buses blocking its entrance and bolt cutters to remove barbed wire. Other officers in the arrest team, which numbered around 1,000, scaled walls and hiked up nearby trails to reach the presidential residence. After several hours, authorities announced that Yoon had been arrested. In a three-minute video released just before his arrest, the 64-year-old leader said he would co-operate with the investigators, while repeating previous claims that the warrant was not legally valid. \"I decided to appear before the CIO, even though it is an illegal investigation, in order to prevent any unsavoury bloodshed,\" he said, adding that he witnessed officials \"invade\" his home's security perimeter with fire equipment. On Wednesday afternoon, investigators said Yoon had remained silent throughout questioning. Yoon's lawyers have said his arrest was \"illegal\" because the CIO, as an anti-corruption agency, has no power to investigate the insurrection allegations against Yoon. They also claim the warrant was issued by the wrong jurisdiction. The same court later dismissed an injunction filed by President Yoon to invalidate the arrest warrant, which the authorities maintain is lawful. The opposition Democratic Party's floor leader, Park Chan-dae, said Wednesday's arrest showed that \"justice in South Korea is alive\". This arrest \"is the first step toward restoring constitutional order, democracy and the rule of law\", he said during a party meeting. The country is currently being led by Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok as acting president. He was thrust into power after the first acting president,Han Duck-soo, was also impeachedby parliament, where the opposition has a sizeable majority. The clock has started ticking for investigators. Under the current warrant, they can hold Yoon for up to 48 hours from the point of arrest, after which they need a new warrant to detain him while he continues to be investigated. If that warrant is granted, they can detain him for up to 20 days before he is brought to trial. Without a new warrant, Yoon must be released."}
{"Article Number": 271, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yv4p95m6vo", "Text": "Tears, dismayed cries and shocked faces: that was the reaction among the supporters of South Korea's suspended president Yoon Suk Yeol outside his home on hearing that he had been arrested. It was amoment that had been in the making for weeks- ever since the last attempt to arrest Yoon on 3 January had failed after adramatic standoff. Yet, when the news of his arrest on came on Wednesday morning, it only seemed to create more uncertainty – and highlight the divide in a country that has already been deeply polarised by Yoon's short-lived martial law order and impeachment by parliament. \"This country is in crisis,\" said one pro-Yoon woman, tears streaming down her face. \"I've been praying since last night for a stable and peaceful South Korea.\" It's what both sides say they want but they cannot agree on how to get there. For the past month, a defiant 64-year-old Yoon was holed up inside his presidential compound in central Seoul, as his supporters and detractors rallied outside. They had turned Yongsan in central Seoul into an epicentre of protest, with tensions often running high. Hundreds of them had camped out overnight on Tuesday, as the arrest appeared imminent, in temperatures that plummeted to -8C. The only thing they shared was the food trucks keeping them warm with steaming drinks and instant noodles. Yoon's supporters jostled with the police officers - numbering 3,000 – who assembled to take him into custody. \"Don't call us stupid far-rights,\" one protester shouted, reflecting the frustration in the Yoon camp. A starkly different scene unfolded on the other side of the street. Opponents of Yoon, who had long called for his arrest, celebrated with chants and cheers. Their jubilation only made the pro-Yoon camp angrier, with some yelling: \"Don't taunt us - this is not funny.\" The gulf is not restricted to this corner of Yongsan. It has loomed over the whole country for more than a month. Yoon's shock announcement of martial law on 3 December almost instantly divided public opinion into two camps. While some believed his claims the country was under threat, a larger group viewed the move as an opportunistic abuse of power. This sentiment was reflected even within Yoon's own party, as several of its lawmakers voted to impeach him. The growing opposition to Yoon's actions has cast a pall over the nation. The year-end season in South Korea is usually vibrant. But this year has been noticeably different. The political turmoil – along with thedevastating Jeju Air crashon 29 December – has created a subdued and sombre atmosphere. Yoon himself had largely avoided the public since he was impeached by parliament in mid-December. He never stepped out of his residence to meet his supporters. On New Year's Day, he sent them a note, saying he was \"closely watching [them] via a YouTube livestream\". He skipped the first hearing of his impeachment trial on 14 January, delaying the proceedings. Before that he had refused to comply with multiple summonses as part of the criminal investigation on insurrection charges, which led to the arrest warrant."}
{"Article Number": 272, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8ke9e27dxo", "Text": "India's latest diplomatic outreach to Afghanistan's Taliban government signals a marked shift in how it sees the geopolitical reality in the region. This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow whenKabul fell to the Taliban. Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns. Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban government expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\". Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports. How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me. \"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says. Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security. China, for example, has gone far: it has actively engaged with the Taliban government, focusing on security and economic interests, and even hasan ambassadorin the country. No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, but up to 40 countries maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with it. That's why experts like Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, are more circumspect about India's outreach. For the past three years, he says, India has maintained contact with the Taliban through a foreign service diplomat. India had closed its consulates in Afghanistan during the civil war in the 1990s and reopened them in 2002 after the war ended. \"We didn't want this hiatus to develop [again], so we wanted to engage. It is very simply a step up in relations,\" he says. India has\"historical and civilisational ties\" with Afghanistan, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament in 2023. India has invested more than $3bn (£2.46bn) in over 500 projects across Afghanistan, including roads, power lines, dams, hospitals and clinics. It has trained Afghan officers, awarded thousands of scholarships to students and built a new parliament building. This reflects a lasting geopolitical reality."}

The term \"clinical obesity\" should be used for patients with a medical condition caused by their weight, while \"pre-clinically obese\" should be applied to those remaining fat but fit, although at risk of disease. This is better for patients than relying only on body mass index (BMI) - which measures whether they are a healthy weight for their height - to determine obesity. More than a billion people are estimated to beliving with obesity worldwideand prescription weight-loss drugs are in high demand. The report, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, is supported by more than 50 medical experts around the world.  \"Some individuals with obesity can maintain normal organ function and overall health, even long term, whereas others display signs and symptoms of severe illness here and now,\" Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, who chaired the expert group, said. \"Obesity is a spectrum,\" he added. The current, blanket definition means too many people are being diagnosed as obese but not receiving the most appropriate care, the report says. Natalie, from Crewe, goes to the gym four times a week and has a healthy diet, but is still overweight. \"I would consider myself on the larger side, but I'm fit,\" she told the BBC 5 Live phone-in with Nicky Campbell. \"If you look at my BMI I'm obese, but if I speak to my doctor they say that I'm fit, healthy and there's nothing wrong with me. \"I'm doing everything I can to stay fit and have a long healthy life,\" she said. Richard, from Falmouth, said there is a lot of confusion around BMI. \"When they did my test, it took me to a level of borderline obesity, but my body fat was only 4.9% - the problem is I had a lot of muscle mass,\" he says. In Mike's opinion, you cannot be fat and fit - he says it is all down to diet. \"All these skinny jabs make me laugh, if you want to lose weight stop eating - it's easy.\" Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as havinga BMI over 30- a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight. It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared. For example, if they are 70kg (about 11 stone) and 1.70m (about 5ft 7in): Find out what your body mass index (BMI) means on the NHS website But BMI has limitations. It measures whether someone is carrying too much weight - but not too much fat. So very muscular people, such as athletes, tend to have a high BMI but not much fat. The report says BMI is useful on a large scale, to work out the proportion of a population who are a healthy weight, overweight or obese. But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs. Measuring a patient's waist or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says."}

It was amoment that had been in the making for weeks- ever since the last attempt to arrest Yoon on 3 January had failed after adramatic standoff. Yet, when the news of his arrest on came on Wednesday morning, it only seemed to create more uncertainty – and highlight the divide in a country that has already been deeply polarised by Yoon's short-lived martial law order and impeachment by parliament. \"This country is in crisis,\" said one pro-Yoon woman, tears streaming down her face. \"I've been praying since last night for a stable and peaceful South Korea.\" It's what both sides say they want but they cannot agree on how to get there. For the past month, a defiant 64-year-old Yoon was holed up inside his presidential compound in central Seoul, as his supporters and detractors rallied outside. They had turned Yongsan in central Seoul into an epicentre of protest, with tensions often running high. Hundreds of them had camped out overnight on Tuesday, as the arrest appeared imminent, in temperatures that plummeted to -8C. The only thing they shared was the food trucks keeping them warm with steaming drinks and instant noodles. Yoon's supporters jostled with the police officers - numbering 3,000 – who assembled to take him into custody. \"Don't call us stupid far-rights,\" one protester shouted, reflecting the frustration in the Yoon camp. A starkly different scene unfolded on the other side of the street. Opponents of Yoon, who had long called for his arrest, celebrated with chants and cheers. Their jubilation only made the pro-Yoon camp angrier, with some yelling: \"Don't taunt us - this is not funny.\" The gulf is not restricted to this corner of Yongsan. It has loomed over the whole country for more than a month. Yoon's shock announcement of martial law on 3 December almost instantly divided public opinion into two camps. While some believed his claims the country was under threat, a larger group viewed the move as an opportunistic abuse of power. This sentiment was reflected even within Yoon's own party, as several of its lawmakers voted to impeach him. The growing opposition to Yoon's actions has cast a pall over the nation. The year-end season in South Korea is usually vibrant. But this year has been noticeably different. The political turmoil – along with thedevastating Jeju Air crashon 29 December – has created a subdued and sombre atmosphere. Yoon himself had largely avoided the public since he was impeached by parliament in mid-December. He never stepped out of his residence to meet his supporters. On New Year's Day, he sent them a note, saying he was \"closely watching [them] via a YouTube livestream\". He skipped the first hearing of his impeachment trial on 14 January, delaying the proceedings. Before that he had refused to comply with multiple summonses as part of the criminal investigation on insurrection charges, which led to the arrest warrant."}

There were reports of a breakthrough on Wednesday, with unnamed Israeli officials cited as saying that Hamas had agreed to the latest draft presented by Qatari, US and Egyptian mediators. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office however swiftly denied the reports. There was also no immediate comment from the Palestinian armed group. On Tuesday night, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said they were \"on the brink\" of an agreement and awaiting \"final word from Hamas\". A senior Hamas official later told Reuters news agency it had not delivered its official response to the draft because Israel had yet to submit maps showing how its troops would withdraw from areas of Gaza. However, Israel's Haaretz newspaper cited an Israeli source as denying Hamas's claim about the maps. The proposed three-phase deal would begin with an initial six-week ceasefire. A Palestinian official told the BBC that Hamas would release three hostages on the first day of a deal, after which Israel would begin withdrawing troops from populated areas. More hostage releases would then be staggered over the following weeks, he said, with Israel allowing displaced residents to return in northern areas. Israel has said it expects 33 hostages to be released in the first phase and that it will free a yet to be determined number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails in return. Negotiations for the second phase - which should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli troop withdrawal and a \"sustainable calm\" - would start after two weeks. Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman said on Tuesday that there were no major issues were blocking a deal and that he was hopeful the talks would \"very soon lead to an agreement\". However, he also warned that that \"the most minor detail\" could yet undermine the process. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 46,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of the 2.3 million population has also been displaced, there is widespread destruction, and there are severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter due to an struggle to get aid to those in need. Israel says 94 of the hostages are still being held by Hamas, of whom 34 are presumed dead. In addition, there are four Israelis who were abducted before the war, two of whom are dead. Relatives of the remaining hostages have urged the Israeli government to do whatever it takes to get a deal over the line and bring all of them home. \"We can't miss this moment. This is the last moment; we can save them,\" said Hadas Kalderon, the wife of Ofer Kalderon, a 54-year-old. Palestinians also dared to hope that an end to the devastating 15-month war was close."}

Forecasters have again identified an area of \"extreme fire danger\", emphasising the risk level in a region to the north-west of the city centre. In some mountainous areas, it is possible for winds to reach speeds of 70mph (113km/h), which would be nearly hurricane-force if they are sustained. The anticipated increase in speeds threatens to spread the remaining four blazes, which firefighters have made further progress in tackling during a few days of calmer conditions. Wind speeds began a slow and steady climb on Wednesday morning in parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. They are expected to peak during the day on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Compared with last week's conditions, winds are \"weaker but still strong\", the NWS cautions. There are hopes of another drop over the subsequent days - but officials have highlighted the need for rain that would help fire crews in their battle. \"The anticipated winds combined with low humidities and low fuel moistures will keep the fire threat in the LA region critical,\" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said during a news conference on Tuesday. Areas to the north-west of Los Angeles - including Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks - have been deemed to be particularly dangerous. An improvement in conditions is forecast later on Thursday and into Friday, says BBC Weather forecaster Sarah Keith-Lucas. But no rainfall is forecast for at least the next week - and the Santa Ana winds that have been blamed for stoking the blazes could again develop from Sunday. The fire chief for the city of Pasadena echoed the need for precipitation. There had been no \"real rain in southern California\" for more than 250 days, Chad Augustin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. His firefighters would spent Wednesday on \"standing guard ready to ensure that we hold our containment lines and we don't burn up any more structures\", Mr Augustin added. An extreme weather attribution study from climate scientists at 'Climameter' has concluded that the Californian wildfires have been fuelled by meteorological conditions strengthened by human-induced climate change. The study found that current conditions have been warmer, drier and windier compared with the past, in the areas affected by the fires. The 25th death from the fires was confirmed by the LA County Medical Examiner's Office. Thirteen other people remain missing. Most of the victims have died in the Eaton Fire, which has burned more than 14,000 acres to the city's north, but has now been 35% contained by firefighters. Further west, the larger Palisades Fire has torched more than 23,000 acres, and is now at 18% containment. Two smaller fires also continue to burn. Some of the victims of the Eaton Fire have now been allowed to return to their homes, although officials say they have no firm date for repopulation of the Palisades area, an upmarket area ravaged by the fire to which it lent its name."}

Efforts were made to get the treaty signed before President-elect Trump's inauguration on Monday, the BBC understands, and it had been expected the Mauritian cabinet would approve the proposal on Wednesday. The UK plans to hand over sovereignty of the cluster of islands in the Indian Ocean, but to maintain a 99-year lease over the joint UK and US military airbase on the largest island, Diego Garcia. A spokesman for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"perfectly reasonable for the US administration to consider the detail\" of any agreement. The deal has drawn criticism from politicians in the UK as well as the incoming US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said it poses a \"serious threat\" to US security. Reports had suggested Mauritian Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam would sign off the deal on Wednesday as he attended a cabinet meeting, but it was later announced his attorney general was travelling to London to continue talks. The UK took control of the Chagos Islands, or British Indian Ocean Territory, from its then colony, Mauritius, in 1965 and went on to evict its population of more than 1,000 people to make way for the Diego Garcia base. Mauritius, which won independence from the UK in 1968, has maintained that the islands are its own, and the UN's highest court has ruled, in an advisory opinion, that the UK's administration of the territory is \"unlawful\". At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir defended his plan, insisting it was the best way to safeguard the military base. However, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the prime minister was \"negotiating a secret deal to surrender British territory and taxpayers in this country will pay for the humiliation\". Badenoch said there was \"no way we should be giving up British territory in Chagos\" and claimed Sir Keir was \"rushing a deal which will be disastrous\". Donald Trump will be sworn in on Monday during a series of events that will kick off his presidency. US President-elect Donald Trump's nominee was grilled for hours about his ability to run the defence department. The Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on “social decline in white America”. The app faces a ban unless it is sold by its parent Chinese company by 19 January.

She had referred herself to the prime minister's standards adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, after questions about links to her aunt, who was ousted last year as Bangladesh's prime minister. Sir Laurie said he had \"not identified evidence of improprieties\" but it was \"regrettable\" that Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of the ties to her aunt. Siddiq said continuing in her role would be \"a distraction\" for the government but insisted she had done nothing wrong. Before her resignation was announced, Siddiq had been named in a second investigation in Bangladesh. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said the prime minister \"dithered and delayed to protect\" her. Writing on X, she said: \"It was clear at the weekend that the anti-corruption minister's position was completely untenable. Yet Keir Starmer dithered and delayed to protect his close friend. \"Even now, as Bangladesh files a criminal case against Tulip Siddiq, he expresses 'sadness' at her inevitable resignation. \"Weak leadership from a weak prime minister.\" In a letter accepting Siddiq's resignation, Sir Keir said the \"door remains open\" for her. Siddiq, whose role as Economic Secretary to the Treasuryincluded tackling corruption in UK financial markets,was named last month in an investigation into claims her family embezzled up to £3.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh. Her aunt is the former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, head of the Awami League, who fled into exile after being deposed last year. Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, also came under intense scrutiny over her use of properties in London linked to her aunt's allies. TheFinancial Times reportedthat one of the properties, a flat in King's Cross, had been given to her by a person connected with the recently ousted Bangladeshi government. According to the Mail on Sunday, in 2022 Siddiq had denied the flat was a gift and insisted her parents had bought it for her and had threatened the paper with legal action preventing publication of a story. Labour sources subsequently told the newspaper the flat had been gifted to Siddiq by a property developer with alleged links to her aunt. Sir Laurie spent eight days investigating the allegations after Siddiq referred herself to the standards watchdog. In his letter, Sir Laurie said Siddiq \"acknowledges that, over an extended period, she was unaware of the origins of her ownership of her flat in Kings Cross, despite having signed a Land Registry transfer form relating to the gift at the time\". He said the MP \"remained under the impression that her parents had given the flat to her, having purchased it from the previous owner\". This had led to the public being \"inadvertently misled\" about the identity of the donor of the flat, added Sir Laurie. Sir Laurie said this was an \"unfortunate misunderstanding\" which had led to Siddiq issuing a public correction of \"the origins of her ownership after she became a minister\"."}

They say the man also tried to get them to sign waivers which stated they did not accuse anyone of \"criminal wrongdoing\". The 11 survivors who have spoken to the BBC have also accused the Egyptian authorities of trying to cover up what happened, saying investigators were determined to blame it on a huge wave. The Sea Story had been carrying 46 people when it sank in the early hours of 25 November last year - four bodies were recovered and seven people are still missing, including two British divers. Neither the Egyptian government nor the boat operators - Dive Pro Liveaboard, based in Hurghada - have responded to our questions. On Tuesday,the BBC revealed multiple accusations from survivors of safety failingson board the vessel. A leading oceanographer who analysed weather data also said it was not plausible that a huge wave had hit the vessel. Within hours of being brought ashore, survivors say they were subjected to what one described as \"an interrogation\", some from their hospital beds, by people they were told were judges. Those who didn't need hospital treatment were interviewed at a nearby resort, said other survivors, who reported the same feelings of being pressured. \"We were told we couldn't leave the room until they'd done everybody's statements,\" says Sarah Martin, an NHS doctor from Lancashire. The judges were part of an Egyptian investigation into what caused the sinking - though survivors say it was not clear exactly who was leading it. The survivors say having their initial statements translated into Arabic by an employee of the company that owned the Sea Story was a clear conflict of interest. Spanish diver Hissora Gonzalez said the man did not initially introduce himself as an employee. \"He just said, 'You have to tell me what happened, and then you have to sign this piece of paper.'\" It was not until later, say several people we spoke to, that the man told them he worked for Dive Pro Liveaboard. The survivors say that, after being translated by the man, their statements were handed to investigators - something that shocked Lisa Wolf. \"A normal judge can't take a translation from someone that's obviously totally involved in the process.\" One survivor, who is a Norwegian police investigator, said she had \"no clue\" what the four pages of Arabic handed back to her actually said. \"They could have written anything. I don't know what I signed,\" Frøydis Adamson explained. Under her signature she says she wrote that she had not been able to read the documents. \"We were in such shock and just wanted to go home,\" said Hissora. Representatives of the boat operators, Dive Pro Liveaboard, also repeatedly tried to push people into signing waivers - say survivors - which would have seen them agreeing to the statement: \"I do not accuse anyone of any criminal wrongdoing."}

It is followed closely by Netflix's Spanish-language musical Emilia Pérez, which tells the story of a Mexican cartel leader who leaves the world of crime to live a new life as a transgender woman. The frontrunners in the Bafta acting categories include Cynthia Erivo and Demi Moore for lead actress and Adrien Brody and Timothee Chalamet for lead actor. But Denzel Washington and Daniel Craig failed to make the shortlist for Gladiator II and Queer respectively. Hugh Grant's nomination in the lead actor category for horror film Heretic, and Saoirse Ronan as leading actress for The Outrun, are among some of the surprises. Jamie Lee Curtis is nominated in the supporting actress category for The Last Showgirl, but the film's main actress Pamela Anderson, who plays an ageing Las Vegas performer, missed out on a nomination. The leading films in the Bafta nominations 12 nominations - Conclave 11 - Emilia Pérez 9 - The Brutalist 7 - Anora, Dune: Part Two and Wicked 6 - A Complete Unknown and Kneecap 5 - Nosferatu and The Substance Another film tipped for success in the current awards season is Anora, which has seven Bafta nominations including best film. It follows the whirlwind romance between a New York sex worker and the son of a wealthy Russian oligarch. Mikey Madison is nominated as leading actress and is also up for the rising star award, which is voted for by the public. Her co-star Yura Borisov is nominated for best supporting actor, and director Sean Baker has his first Bafta best director nomination. Half of those nominated in the best director category are first-time nominees and also include The Brutalist's Brady Corbet, who won the same award at the Golden Globes. The film, about a Hungarian architect who is hired by a wealthy American after World War Two, has nine nods in total and is also tipped to be a big contender at the Oscars. The Substance director Coralie Fargeat is another first-time directing nominee and is the only female nominated in the category. Demi Moore is nominated for best actress for the film, weeks after winning at the Golden Globes - putting her in a strong position for the Oscars. Conclave's Edward Berger is also nominated for best director, and thanked the \"wonderful crew\" who helped the film earn 12 nominations. He had found \"a team of like-minded people who bond together to strive for the unattainable goal - perfection\", he said. British actress Marianne Jean-Baptiste's nomination in the same category for playing an irritable woman struggling with depression in Hard Truths has boosted momentum for her to receive an Oscar nomination. The Bafta shortlist is often a strong indicator for the Oscars, and last year the winners of the top six categories matched perfectly at the two ceremonies. Another Oscar-tipped film is A Complete Unknown, which follows Bob Dylan's rise to fame in the 1960s."}

Ever\". The 64-year-old was accused on Monday of sexual misconduct by eight women, including four who had previously spoken out. On Tuesday, in a blog post titled Breaking The Silence, Gaiman said he had read the allegations with \"horror and dismay\". He wrote: \"I've stayed quiet until now, both out of respect for the people who were sharing their stories and out of a desire not to draw even more attention to a lot of misinformation.\" He continued: \"I've always tried to be a private person, and felt increasingly that social media was the wrong place to talk about important personal matters. I've now reached the point where I feel that I should say something. \"As I read through this latest collection of accounts, there are moments I half-recognise and moments I don't, descriptions of things that happened sitting beside things that emphatically did not happen. \"I'm far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.\" The fantasy graphic novel and science-fiction writer - whose books Good Omens, American Gods and The Sandman have been adapted for television - was the subject of a New York Magazine cover story on Monday. The magazine and its website Vulture reported allegations from eight women, four of whom also previously accused Gaiman of sexual assault in July 2024 on a Tortoise Media podcast. One of the women, who had been babysitting Gaiman's five-year-old child, alleged that he offered her a bath in his garden before joining her in the tub naked, asking her to sit on his lap, and that he sexually assaulted her. The British author said he read back text messages from the time of the alleged incidents and felt they were \"of two people enjoying entirely consensual sexual relationships\". \"At the time I was in those relationships, they seemed positive and happy on both sides,\" he wrote. He acknowledged that he was \"careless with people's hearts and feelings\" and could have \"done so much better\", but said he doesn't \"accept there was any abuse\". The author said he understood that \"not everyone will believe me\" and added he would be \"doing my very best to deserve their trust, as well as the trust of my readers\". He claimed some of the allegations \"simply never happened\" while others had been \"distorted\" to \"bear no relationship to reality\", but said he would \"take responsibility for any missteps I made\". A police report accusing Gaiman of a sexual assault was made in January 2023, but the investigation was eventually dropped. Since the allegations surfaced, several of Gaiman's film and TV projects have been affected. Season three of Prime Video's Good Omens will now comprise one 90-minute episode, with Gaiman no longer involved. Disney has paused production on its film adaptation of another Gaiman title, The Graveyard Book, while Netflix has cancelled Dead Boy Detectives, although it's not clear if this was related to the allegations."}

The findings come as negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appear to be nearing a breakthrough. Mediators in Qatar say talks are in their final stages, raising hopes that an agreement could be reached soon. The \"humanitarian zone\" was first established by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in October 2023 toprotect civilians and keep them out of harms way. On 6 May 2024, the IDF significantly expanded the zone to include the cities of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah. The area - much of which is a strip of land along the Mediterranean sea - is densely populated and is estimated to have over a million people living there according to international humanitarian organisations. Many people are living in tents, with limited infrastructure and limited access to aid. Local media reports indicate more than 550 people have been killed in the 97 strikes mapped by BBC Verify. In a statement to BBC Verify, the IDF said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating in the \"humanitarian zone\" and accused the group of violating international law while \"exploiting\" civilians as human shields and launching rockets from the area. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's 7 October 2023 attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. The conflict has caused widespread damage to infrastructure across Gaza, with satellite images showing areas flattened by Israeli strikes. The Hamas-run health ministry also says more than 46,600 people have been killed within the enclave since the start of the war. BBC Verify analysis suggests that attacks within the \"humanitarian zone\" have intensified since May 2024, with at least 22 strikes already recorded so far this month. We also cannot confirm that all incidents are the result of IDF attacks. Locations of strikes documented by BBC Verify were provided to the IDF but they did not confirm or deny their involvement. Israeli military officials have only publicly acknowledged 28 attacks since 6 May. Israel historically has not publicly acknowledged every strike it has carried out in Gaza. Gavin Kelleher, an access manager in Gaza for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said there were \"near daily\" strikes within the zone, including from Israeli ships and quadcopters, or small drones. He added that \"heavy fire is recurrent in this area despite its [Israel's] unilateral 'humanitarian' designation.\" \"The Israeli military appears keen to maintain the illusion of a Humanitarian Zone that remains a certain size, yet that zone can be subject to 'evacuation orders' at any time and be targeted,\" Mr Kelleher said. One resident who lives within the zone, Khaled Abdel Rahman, told the BBC that residents were being subjected to daily bombardments, frequently resulting in injuries and casualties. \"We were displaced to Khan Younis because it was designated as a safe zone, but in fact we find nothing here but insecurity,\" Mr Rahman said."}

Photos of him and stories of people who have met him are incredibly rare. But now a man who got the secretive artist to work with children at a youth club in the late 1990s has given the BBC an exclusive insight into the man behind the murals, just as he was about to become famous. Banksy is one of the world's most famous graffiti artists. His work has sold for millions of pounds and his exhibitions seen by hundreds of thousands of people. But behind layers of paint, lost in time at a Bristol youth club, there's a Banksy very few people know about. On the cusp of international fame, the artist was leaving his mark - not only on the streets of his city, but on young people in Lawrence Weston. Here, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural. \"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building. \"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\" Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous. The artist would return to the club several times to create new works, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds – oblivious to who the artist would eventually become. It was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol. His friend had a suggestion – someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself. That person was Banksy. \"I got his phone number, so I used to call him up and ask if he'd come and do some art projects. He was really keen,\" Peter said. This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police. Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids. The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub. \"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society. \"It was always very vibrant.\" Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \"nobody thought twice about who he was\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston. He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said. \"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego. He was doing art with them, rather than doing art for them,\" he said. \"In the morning, he sat around a table with the children, talking about their ideas."}

Vice-President-elect JD Vance will also take the oath of office, joining Trump on stage to officially begin their new administration. The inauguration is the formal ceremony that marks the end of one president's time in office and the start of their successor's administration. It is the most high-profile part of the transition of power between government leaders in Washington DC. A key part of the ceremony includes the president-elect reciting the oath of office: \"I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" Though he won the election in November, Trump officially becomes the 47th president once he says those words. He previously served as the 45th president between 2017 and 2021. Vance will also take an oath of office before he formally assumes the position of vice-president. Trump's second inauguration day will kick off with a service at St. John's Church, Lafayette Square, a historic Washington DC church, followed by tea at the White House. Musical performances and opening remarks are set to begin on the main event stage - located on the West Lawn of the US Capitol building - at 09:30 EST (14:30 GMT). That will be followed by the swearing-in of Trump and Vance as well as the inaugural address in which the president will set out his goals for the next four years. Trump will then head inside to the President's Room - near the Senate chamber - to sign key documents. He will then attend a lunch hosted by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. This is followed by a parade which goes from the Capitol building down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Later in the evening, Trump will appear at three inaugural balls throughout the city - the Commander-in-Chief Ball, the Liberty Inaugural Ball and the Starlight Ball. He is expected to speak at all three. There is typically high demand to watch the inauguration in person, and tickets are highly sought after. Members of Congress receive a certain number of tickets to the ceremony, which they can distribute to their constituents. These tickets are free, but often challenging to get. Americans can contact their congressperson directly for tickets. If you're not able to attend in person, there are plenty of ways to watch remotely. The White House will livestream the inauguration. The BBC will carry inauguration coverage live on our news channel. You can also watch a stream of the inauguration on our website and follow our live page, where we'll bring you updates, analysis and key moments as they happen. Local and federal officials are expecting around 200,000 people to show up in Washington DC, which could include Trump supporters and protestors."}
{"Article Number": 285, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyng762q4eo", "Text": "TikTok will be banned in the US on 19 January - unless the Supreme Court accepts alast ditch legal bid fromits Chinese owner, ByteDance, that to do so would be unconstitutional. But even if the country's highest judicial authority agrees with the lower courts - and Congress - that the platform is a threat to national security will that actually stop Americans using it? Will there be ways to bypass the ban - or could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop a law he says he opposed to, even if the courts uphold it. And whatever happens to TikTok, who stands to benefit from the uncertainty clouding its future? The most likely way the US would ban TikTok is to order app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, to make it unavailable for download in that region. US lawmakers have already told  tech firms to be ready to remove the app from their stores if a ban comes into force. That would mean people could no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok - though it would also mean people who've already got it would still have it on their phones. Because the app would not be publicly available anymore, new updates could no longer be delivered to users in the US - which would make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable. Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target. Of course, there are ways around such a ban. There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region. The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements. It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks. However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app. So if the ban took this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to. There are still other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether. And even if people did use a VPN, there are still ways TikTok could theoretically judge whether a person is based in the US - and then simply present them with a screen saying the app is not available in their country. It remains to be seen whether TikTok would decide to assist the government in its own ban - but it is being reported by Reuters that it plans to do so. TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US unless it rules in its favour."}

This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow whenKabul fell to the Taliban. Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns. Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban government expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\". Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports. How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me. \"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says. Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security. China, for example, has gone far: it has actively engaged with the Taliban government, focusing on security and economic interests, and even hasan ambassadorin the country. No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, but up to 40 countries maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with it. That's why experts like Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, are more circumspect about India's outreach. For the past three years, he says, India has maintained contact with the Taliban through a foreign service diplomat. India had closed its consulates in Afghanistan during the civil war in the 1990s and reopened them in 2002 after the war ended. \"We didn't want this hiatus to develop [again], so we wanted to engage. It is very simply a step up in relations,\" he says. India has\"historical and civilisational ties\" with Afghanistan, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament in 2023.

{"Article Number": 287, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cql5dx1l9e9o", "Text": "For years people have tried - and failed - to uncover details about Bristol's most famous, yet anonymous, graffiti artist Banksy. Photos of him and stories of people who have met him are incredibly rare. But now a man who got the secretive artist to work with children at a youth club in the late 1990s has given the BBC an exclusive insight into the man behind the murals, just as he was about to become famous. Banksy is one of the world's most famous graffiti artists. His work has sold for millions of pounds and his exhibitions seen by hundreds of thousands of people. But behind layers of paint, lost in time at a Bristol youth club, there's a Banksy very few people know about. On the cusp of international fame, the artist was leaving his mark - not only on the streets of his city, but on young people in Lawrence Weston. Here, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural. \"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building. \"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\" Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous. The artist would return to the club several times to create new works, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds – oblivious to who the artist would eventually become. It was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol. His friend had a suggestion – someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself. That person was Banksy. \"I got his phone number, so I used to call him up and ask if he'd come and do some art projects. He was really keen,\" Peter said. This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police. Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids. The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub. \"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society. \"It was always very vibrant.\" Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \"nobody thought twice about who he was\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston. He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said. \"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego. He was doing art with them, rather than doing art for them,\" he said. \"In the morning, he sat around a table with the children, talking about their ideas."}

She had referred herself to the prime minister's standards adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, after questions about links to her aunt, who was ousted last year as Bangladesh's prime minister. Sir Laurie said he had \"not identified evidence of improprieties\" but it was \"regrettable\" that Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of the ties to her aunt. Siddiq said continuing in her role would be \"a distraction\" for the government but insisted she had done nothing wrong. Before her resignation was announced, Siddiq had been named in a second investigation in Bangladesh. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said the prime minister \"dithered and delayed to protect\" her. Writing on X, she said: \"It was clear at the weekend that the anti-corruption minister's position was completely untenable. Yet Keir Starmer dithered and delayed to protect his close friend. \"Even now, as Bangladesh files a criminal case against Tulip Siddiq, he expresses 'sadness' at her inevitable resignation. \"Weak leadership from a weak prime minister.\" In a letter accepting Siddiq's resignation, Sir Keir said the \"door remains open\" for her. Siddiq, whose role as Economic Secretary to the Treasuryincluded tackling corruption in UK financial markets,was named last month in an investigation into claims her family embezzled up to £3.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh. Her aunt is the former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, head of the Awami League, who fled into exile after being deposed last year. Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, also came under intense scrutiny over her use of properties in London linked to her aunt's allies. TheFinancial Times reportedthat one of the properties, a flat in King's Cross, had been given to her by a person connected with the recently ousted Bangladeshi government. According to the Mail on Sunday, in 2022 Siddiq had denied the flat was a gift and insisted her parents had bought it for her and had threatened the paper with legal action preventing publication of a story. Labour sources subsequently told the newspaper the flat had been gifted to Siddiq by a property developer with alleged links to her aunt. Sir Laurie spent eight days investigating the allegations after Siddiq referred herself to the standards watchdog. In his letter, Sir Laurie said Siddiq \"acknowledges that, over an extended period, she was unaware of the origins of her ownership of her flat in Kings Cross, despite having signed a Land Registry transfer form relating to the gift at the time\". He said the MP \"remained under the impression that her parents had given the flat to her, having purchased it from the previous owner\". This had led to the public being \"inadvertently misled\" about the identity of the donor of the flat, added Sir Laurie. Sir Laurie said this was an \"unfortunate misunderstanding\" which had led to Siddiq issuing a public correction of \"the origins of her ownership after she became a minister\"."}
{"Article Number": 296, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyv433le3vno", "Text": "Drake has scrapped a legal case against Universal Music and Spotify, in which he accused the companies of conspiring to boost the streams of Kendrick Lamar's diss track against him, Not Like Us. The Canadian startook action last November, alleging that the music companies had used bots, payola and other methods to promote Lamar's song, which accused him of paedophilia. \"The record-shattering spread of Not Like Us on streaming, sales, and radio play was deliberate and appears to have relied upon irregular and inappropriate business practices,\" court documents alleged. However, on Tuesday, Drake's lawyers voluntarily withdrew a pre-action filing, effectively ending the case. According to court documents filed in New York, the star met with representatives of Spotify and Universal on Tuesday to discuss the case. Spotify, which had filed an opposition, had no objection to the withdrawal and discontinuance. Universal, which hadn't filed an opposition, reserved its position. A related case, filed against Universal and radio network iHeartRadio in Texas, is still active.  Not Like Us was widely regarded as the decisive blow in a long-running feud between Drake and Lamar, which dates back to the early 2010s. In the lyrics, Lamar alleges that Drake \"likes 'em young\" and accuses him of using other, more credible rappers, to boost his profile. Around 24 hours later, Drake responded with a track called The Heart Part 6, where he rejected the allegations, saying, \"I never been with no one under age\". He also  claimed to have fed Lamar \"false\" information through a double agent. However, his retort failed to attract the same attention as Not Like Us, which debuted at number one in the US chart and attracted more than 1 billion streams on Spotify. Taking to the courts, Drake accused Universal - which distributes both his music and Lamar's - of artificially boosting the song's numbers. In court documents, he claimed that the label licensed the song \"at drastically reduced rates to Spotify\" and used bots to stream the song, generating \"the false impression that the song was more popular than it was in reality\".  The papers were not a lawsuit, but a \"pre-action petition\", in which Drake's lawyers sought to gain access to internal documents at Spotify and Universal which might have supported their case. In a statement at the time, Universal told the BBC: \"The suggestion that [the company] would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue. \"We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns. No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\" Spotify also responded that there was \"no economic incentive for users to stream Not Like Us over any of Drake's tracks\". The Swedish streaming company later filed an opposition brief to Drake's petition, stating that it \"should be denied\". Music industry experts had been sceptical that the accusations would ever reach trial."}

Some horses came solo, others in trailers packed with fellow animals. Many had their owners, but others arrived alone, brought in by their rescuers or animal control. Pigs, donkeys and miniature horses followed. Within 24 hours, the Los Angeles Equestrian Center had been transformed into a modern-day Noah's Ark. Over the last week, it has sheltered hundreds of animals from the disaster as part of its official role as one of the city's large animal shelters. The facility, tucked in the shadow of Griffith Park, has taken in more than 200 horses, on top of the roughly 500 already living there.  Last Tuesday and Wednesday were \"chaos\", said Jennie Nevin, a spokeswoman for the equestrian centre. The facility catalogued every horse that arrived, making sure they could be reunited. Sheltering the animals came at no cost for the owners, thanks to the support of public donations and frequent drop-offs of free hay, feed and other supplies. Sergio Marcial was one of dozens of people who brought animals here after their own facilities were destroyed or threatened. A week ago, he and his girlfriend Jenny Bacon raced to help rescue more than 70 animals from theEaton Dam Stables while battling flames so intense that his face mask caught fire and his eyeglasses shattered and warped. His efforts landed him in the hospital, his lungs and throat burned after inhaling the torched air. One week later, Mr Marcial, 29, and Ms Bacon, 30, walked Arthur and Playboy - two miniature horses he helped save that night - around their new home. Here, they were safe from the fires, and they seemed calm and friendly despite everything they had endured. \"It still hurts to swallow,\" Mr Marcial said, pointing to a face mask he's required to wear to prevent infections. \"I'd do it all again - no question.\" Most of the sheltered animals' owners have been identified, and several owners spent Tuesday afternoon walking their horses around the stables. Dozens of volunteers cared for the other animals staying at the centre. Some had become local celebrities. Two donkeys, Morris and Mika, frequently poked their heads out of their stables to demand attention. They had fled down the mountain with their owner as the Palisades fire drew near, and were reunited because he had spray-painted his number on to their sides. \"They love for you to sing to them,\" said volunteer Lucena Herrera. \"We've all just been adopting them and taking care of them.\" But a handful of animals still have not been claimed. A miniature horse named Izzy had still not found her owner a week after the fires. The volunteers had collectively adopted her until she could find a new, permanent home.  So many volunteers showed up to help the animals that the staff had to turn some away, Ms Nevin said. Between 50-100 volunteers now raked stalls, fed the animals, fluffed hay and serenaded Morris and Mika when they grew antsy."}

Public Service Cabinet Secretary Justin Muturi said that it took a call by President William Ruto to have his son released by the National Intelligence Service (NIS). Muturi is the first member of the cabinet to publicly criticise the government's handling of the spate of abductions in Kenya. In a statement to the police crime investigations unit on Tuesday, Muturi gave a detailed account of how his son, Leslie, was abducted on 22 June last year. Mr Ruto and the intelligence agency have not commented on his allegations. At least 80 people, including the minister's son, have been abducted in the last six months, according to a state-funded rights group. The wave of abductions started after protests against tax hikes last June, and have continued since then. Some of those abducted have been released following public pressure. Earlier this week, the minister told journalists that he had not received answers about the abduction of his son, despite reaching out to top security officials. Muturi said the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) subsequently urged him to record a statement with them, telling him the matter was still under investigation. In his statement to the DCI, Muturi recalled calling the inspector-general of police, the interior minister, the DCI head, the head of the intelligence agency and other top officials as he desperately looked for his son – but, he added, all were unable to help. He said that he also messaged Ruto, but later decided to visit his official residence to raise the matter directly with him. \"I then narrated the ordeal [to the president] including my interactions with various senior government officials who had been unable to help. I expressed my belief that NIS was holding my son,\" Muturi said in the statement. He said that the president made a joke about the issue and then made a call to the head of the intelligence agency, who promised to release his son in an hour. \"I heard the president ask [NIS director] Noordin Haji if he was holding my son. [He] confirmed that indeed he was holding my son and the president instructed him to release Leslie immediately,\" Muturi added. Muturi has faced calls from some government-allied politicians to resign for publicly criticising the government in which he serves. Foreign nationals have also been abducted, including prominent Tanzanian activist Maria Sarungi Tsehai, who on Monday narrated how she was kidnapped by armed men and released several hours later. Last year, Ugandan opposition leader Kizza Besigye was kidnapped in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, allegedly by Ugandan security officials, and taken across the border for trial by a court martial. Muturi's public mentioning of Ruto's name in connection with abductions is a defiant challenge to the president, and is seen as being against the principle of collective responsibility in government."}

She had referred herself to the prime minister's standards adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, after questions about links to her aunt, who was ousted last year as Bangladesh's prime minister. Sir Laurie said he had \"not identified evidence of improprieties\" but it was \"regrettable\" that Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of the ties to her aunt. Siddiq said continuing in her role would be \"a distraction\" for the government but insisted she had done nothing wrong. Before her resignation was announced, Siddiq had been named in a second investigation in Bangladesh. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said the prime minister \"dithered and delayed to protect\" her. Writing on X, she said: \"It was clear at the weekend that the anti-corruption minister's position was completely untenable. Yet Keir Starmer dithered and delayed to protect his close friend. \"Even now, as Bangladesh files a criminal case against Tulip Siddiq, he expresses 'sadness' at her inevitable resignation. \"Weak leadership from a weak prime minister.\" In a letter accepting Siddiq's resignation, Sir Keir said the \"door remains open\" for her. Siddiq, whose role as Economic Secretary to the Treasuryincluded tackling corruption in UK financial markets,was named last month in an investigation into claims her family embezzled up to £3.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh. Her aunt is the former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, head of the Awami League, who fled into exile after being deposed last year. Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, also came under intense scrutiny over her use of properties in London linked to her aunt's allies. TheFinancial Times reportedthat one of the properties, a flat in King's Cross, had been given to her by a person connected with the recently ousted Bangladeshi government. According to the Mail on Sunday, in 2022 Siddiq had denied the flat was a gift and insisted her parents had bought it for her and had threatened the paper with legal action preventing publication of a story. Labour sources subsequently told the newspaper the flat had been gifted to Siddiq by a property developer with alleged links to her aunt. Sir Laurie spent eight days investigating the allegations after Siddiq referred herself to the standards watchdog. In his letter, Sir Laurie said Siddiq \"acknowledges that, over an extended period, she was unaware of the origins of her ownership of her flat in Kings Cross, despite having signed a Land Registry transfer form relating to the gift at the time\". He said the MP \"remained under the impression that her parents had given the flat to her, having purchased it from the previous owner\". This had led to the public being \"inadvertently misled\" about the identity of the donor of the flat, added Sir Laurie. Sir Laurie said this was an \"unfortunate misunderstanding\" which had led to Siddiq issuing a public correction of \"the origins of her ownership after she became a minister\"."}

Yoon, 64, is being investigated on charges of insurrection for a failed martial law order on 3 December that plunged the country into turmoil. He has also been impeached by parliament and suspended - but will only be removed from office if the Constitutional Court upholds the impeachment. However, Yoon's dramatic arrest on Wednesday brings to an end a weeks-long standoff between investigators and his presidential security team. Investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) failed to arrest him on 3 January after being locked in a six-hour stand-off with his security detail. But just before dawn on Wednesday, a much larger team of investigators and police arrived at his residence in central Seoul, armed with ladders to climb over buses blocking its entrance and bolt cutters to remove barbed wire. Other officers in the arrest team, which numbered around 1,000, scaled walls and hiked up nearby trails to reach the presidential residence. After several hours, authorities announced that Yoon had been arrested. In a three-minute video released just before his arrest, the 64-year-old leader said he would co-operate with the investigators, while repeating previous claims that the warrant was not legally valid. \"I decided to appear before the CIO, even though it is an illegal investigation, in order to prevent any unsavoury bloodshed,\" he said, adding that he witnessed officials \"invade\" his home's security perimeter with fire equipment. On Wednesday afternoon, investigators said Yoon had remained silent throughout questioning. Yoon's lawyers have said his arrest was \"illegal\" because the CIO, as an anti-corruption agency, has no power to investigate the insurrection allegations against Yoon. They also claim the warrant was issued by the wrong jurisdiction. The same court later dismissed an injunction filed by President Yoon to invalidate the arrest warrant, which the authorities maintain is lawful. The opposition Democratic Party's floor leader, Park Chan-dae, said Wednesday's arrest showed that \"justice in South Korea is alive\". This arrest \"is the first step toward restoring constitutional order, democracy and the rule of law\", he said during a party meeting. The country is currently being led by Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok as acting president. He was thrust into power after the first acting president,Han Duck-soo, was also impeachedby parliament, where the opposition has a sizeable majority. The clock has started ticking for investigators. Under the current warrant, they can hold Yoon for up to 48 hours from the point of arrest, after which they need a new warrant to detain him while he continues to be investigated. If that warrant is granted, they can detain him for up to 20 days before he is brought to trial. Without a new warrant, Yoon must be released."}

Forecasters have again identified an area of \"extreme fire danger\", emphasising the risk level in a region to the north-west of the city centre. In some mountainous areas, it is possible for winds to reach speeds of 70mph (113km/h), which would be nearly hurricane-force if they are sustained. The anticipated increase in speeds threatens to spread the remaining four blazes, which firefighters have made further progress in tackling during a few days of calmer conditions. Wind speeds began a slow and steady climb on Wednesday morning in parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. They are expected to peak during the day on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Compared with last week's conditions, winds are \"weaker but still strong\", the NWS cautions. There are hopes of another drop over the subsequent days - but officials have highlighted the need for rain that would help fire crews in their battle. \"The anticipated winds combined with low humidities and low fuel moistures will keep the fire threat in the LA region critical,\" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said during a news conference on Tuesday. Areas to the north-west of Los Angeles - including Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks - have been deemed to be particularly dangerous. An improvement in conditions is forecast later on Thursday and into Friday, says BBC Weather forecaster Sarah Keith-Lucas. But no rainfall is forecast for at least the next week - and the Santa Ana winds that have been blamed for stoking the blazes could again develop from Sunday. The fire chief for the city of Pasadena echoed the need for precipitation. There had been no \"real rain in southern California\" for more than 250 days, Chad Augustin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. His firefighters would spent Wednesday on \"standing guard ready to ensure that we hold our containment lines and we don't burn up any more structures\", Mr Augustin added. An extreme weather attribution study from climate scientists at 'Climameter' has concluded that the Californian wildfires have been fuelled by meteorological conditions strengthened by human-induced climate change. The study found that current conditions have been warmer, drier and windier compared with the past, in the areas affected by the fires. The 25th death from the fires was confirmed by the LA County Medical Examiner's Office. Thirteen other people remain missing. Most of the victims have died in the Eaton Fire, which has burned more than 14,000 acres to the city's north, but has now been 35% contained by firefighters. Further west, the larger Palisades Fire has torched more than 23,000 acres, and is now at 18% containment. Two smaller fires also continue to burn. Some of the victims of the Eaton Fire have now been allowed to return to their homes, although officials say they have no firm date for repopulation of the Palisades area, an upmarket area ravaged by the fire to which it lent its name."}

This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow whenKabul fell to the Taliban. Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns. Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban government expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\". Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports. How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me. \"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says. Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security. China, for example, has gone far: it has actively engaged with the Taliban government, focusing on security and economic interests, and even hasan ambassadorin the country. No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, but up to 40 countries maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with it. That's why experts like Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, are more circumspect about India's outreach. For the past three years, he says, India has maintained contact with the Taliban through a foreign service diplomat. India had closed its consulates in Afghanistan during the civil war in the 1990s and reopened them in 2002 after the war ended. \"We didn't want this hiatus to develop [again], so we wanted to engage. It is very simply a step up in relations,\" he says. India has\"historical and civilisational ties\" with Afghanistan, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament in 2023. India has invested more than $3bn (£2.46bn) in over 500 projects across Afghanistan, including roads, power lines, dams, hospitals and clinics. It has trained Afghan officers, awarded thousands of scholarships to students and built a new parliament building. This reflects a lasting geopolitical reality."}

The term \"clinical obesity\" should be used for patients with a medical condition caused by their weight, while \"pre-clinically obese\" should be applied to those remaining fat but fit, although at risk of disease. This is better for patients than relying only on body mass index (BMI) - which measures whether they are a healthy weight for their height - to determine obesity. More than a billion people are estimated to beliving with obesity worldwideand prescription weight-loss drugs are in high demand. The report, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, is supported by more than 50 medical experts around the world.  \"Some individuals with obesity can maintain normal organ function and overall health, even long term, whereas others display signs and symptoms of severe illness here and now,\" Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, who chaired the expert group, said. \"Obesity is a spectrum,\" he added. The current, blanket definition means too many people are being diagnosed as obese but not receiving the most appropriate care, the report says. Natalie, from Crewe, goes to the gym four times a week and has a healthy diet, but is still overweight. \"I would consider myself on the larger side, but I'm fit,\" she told the BBC 5 Live phone-in with Nicky Campbell. \"If you look at my BMI I'm obese, but if I speak to my doctor they say that I'm fit, healthy and there's nothing wrong with me. \"I'm doing everything I can to stay fit and have a long healthy life,\" she said. Richard, from Falmouth, said there is a lot of confusion around BMI. \"When they did my test, it took me to a level of borderline obesity, but my body fat was only 4.9% - the problem is I had a lot of muscle mass,\" he says. In Mike's opinion, you cannot be fat and fit - he says it is all down to diet. \"All these skinny jabs make me laugh, if you want to lose weight stop eating - it's easy.\" Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as havinga BMI over 30- a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight. It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared. For example, if they are 70kg (about 11 stone) and 1.70m (about 5ft 7in): Find out what your body mass index (BMI) means on the NHS website But BMI has limitations. It measures whether someone is carrying too much weight - but not too much fat. So very muscular people, such as athletes, tend to have a high BMI but not much fat. The report says BMI is useful on a large scale, to work out the proportion of a population who are a healthy weight, overweight or obese. But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs. Measuring a patient's waist or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says."}
{"Article Number": 305, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp5xe1zwgo", "Text": "Just before dawn on Wednesday, 3,000 police officers arrived at the heavily-fortified residence of South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol. Their mission: to arrest him. Investigators used ladders to scale over buses and bolt cutters to get through barbed wire as they broke through multiple blockades designed to stop them. Others hiked up nearby trails to reach the presidential residence. Hours later, they took him into custody for questioning over an alleged act of insurrection. This was their second attempt. Their first, which took place earlier this month, had seen some 150 officers face a six-hour deadlock with the president's security detail. They were helplessly outnumbered, first by the large number of pro-Yoon supporters who had gathered outside his residence to stop the police, and then by a human wall of security officers inside the property. Eventually, investigators concluded that it was \"practically impossible\" to arrest him - and left. Many now see Yoon as a disgraced leader - impeached and suspended from his presidential duties for trying to impose martial law, while heawaits the decision of the Constitutional Court, which can remove him from office. So why has it been so difficult to arrest him? It has been an unprecedented few weeks for South Korea since Yoon's shocking yet short-lived martial law order on 3 December. Lawmakers voted to impeach him, then came a criminal investigation and his refusal to appear for questioning, which was what sparked the arrest warrant. One key roadblock for the arresting officers had been Yoon's presidential security team, which on 3 January had formed a human wall and used vehicles to block the officers' path. Analysts said they could have acted out of loyalty to Yoon, pointing to the fact that Yoon himself had appointed several leaders of the Presidential Security Service (PSS). \"It may well be the case that Yoon has seeded the organisation with hardline loyalists in preparation for precisely this eventuality,\" says US-based lawyer and Korea expert Christopher Jumin Lee. It is unclear why they reportedly put up less resistance this time, though Mr Lee believes the team may have been partly deterred by the \"overwhelming show of force by the police\". \"At the end of the day I think they were simply unwilling to engage in the sort of large-scale violence against law enforcement officers that a full-throated defence of Yoon would have demanded,\" he said. Earlier this week, the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) had warned the PSS that they risked losing their pensions and their civil servant status for obstructing the arrest. In contrast, it reassured those who \"defy illegal orders\" to block the arrest that they \"will not face disadvantages\". On Wednesday, Yonhap news agency reported that a number of PSS members were either on leave or had chosen to stay inside the residence. The right-wing leader also has a strong support base. Some of Yoon's supporters had earlier told the BBC that they wereprepared to die to protect himand  repeated unfounded allegations that Yoon himself has floated, including that the country had been infiltrated by pro-North Korea forces."}

For more than four hours on Tuesday, Hegseth faced questions about his ability to run the defence department, including its three million employees and $849bn (£695bn) budget. And although he was grilled by Democrats overaccusations of sexual assault, infidelity and drinking in the workplace, he appears all but certain to be confirmed to the role after no Republicans came out against him. This was underscored later on Tuesday when Joni Ernst, one Republican who had been seen as a potential roadblock to his nomination, said she would support him. Here's a look at the five main takeaways from Hegseth's testimony. From the very start of his testimony,Hegseth, a military veteran,emphasised what he called a \"warrior culture\", vowing to return the focus of the defence department to the strength of America's military. \"Warfighting, lethality, meritocracy, standards, and readiness. That's it. That is my job,\" he said in his opening statements. As the hearing continued, Hegseth was critical of policies he felt harmed the efficiency and \"lethality\" of the military, namely efforts aimed at racial and gender diversity. \"This is not a time for equity,\" he said, adding that he opposes quotas, which he claims hurt morale. In what became an expectedly partisan hearing, Democrats repeatedly grilled Hegseth on his past statements suggesting women were not suited to serve in combat roles in the military. Questions along these lines from Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Mazie Hirono and Elizabeth Warren provided some of the most heated moments of the morning. He spoke over Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, as she tried to point to comments about female service members stretching back years. \"Mr Hegseth, I'm quoting you in a podcast: 'Women shouldn't be in combat at all',\" Warren said. Hegseth remained composed, responding by saying his concern was not women in combat, but simply maintaining \"standards\" in the military. Hegseth, who at 44 would be the youngest defence secretary in decades, also answered questions about his preparedness to run the defence department, a sprawling agency. The former Fox News host described himself as a \"change agent\", saying \"it's time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm.\" Some Republicans deemed Hegseth's lack of experience a strength. \"I just want to say for all the talk of experience and not coming from the same cocktail parties that permanent Washington is used to, you are a breath of fresh air,\" Senator Eric Schmitt, a Republican from Missouri, said. A graduate of Princeton and Harvard universities, Hegseth was an infantry platoon leader in Guantanamo Bay and Iraq, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. Hegseth, also a former Fox News TV host, has military experience in Afghanistan as well. Still, Democrats pressed Hegseth on his qualifications for the top military job."}

The changes, which are set to come into force from 27 January, are a U-turn from a policy introduced six years ago that allowed people to linger in Starbucks outlets and use their toilets without making a purchase. The move is part of the \"back to Starbucks\" strategy - a plan announced by the firm's new boss as he tries to tackle flagging sales. Starbucks said there was no change to its policy in the UK, where customers can continue to use the facilities without purchasing anything. The world's biggest coffee chain says its new code of conduct - which also addresses harassment and bans smoking and outside alcohol - aims to make its stores more welcoming. \"Implementing a Coffeehouse Code of Conduct... is a practical step that helps us prioritise our paying customers who want to sit and enjoy our cafes,\" a Starbucks spokesperson told BBC News. \"These updates are part of a broader set of changes we are making to enhance the cafe experience as we work to get back to Starbucks.\" The company said the new rules would be displayed at every store and staff would be instructed to ask anyone who violates the code of conduct to leave. That includes allowing employees to call the police when necessary. The change ends a policy Starbucks introduced in 2018 after two black men were arrested at one of the company's stores in Philadelphia. The men, one of whom had asked to use the toilet, had said they were waiting for a friend and refused a manager's request to leave. The video of the incident went viral, and critics accused the chain of racial profiling and called for a boycott. Starbucks apologised to the men, agreed a settlement, and to help counter the backlash announced it would welcome people into their cafes, whether or not they were customers. Starbucks has been trying to boost flagging sales as it grappled with a backlash to price increases and boycotts sparked by the Israel-Gaza war. Brian Niccol, who previously headed the Mexican food chain Chipotle, wasbrought into Starbucks last yearto help turn the business around. Mr Niccol has been trying to improve the customer experience at Starbucks' cafes byrevamping its menusand coffee shops.

A red flag warning - indicating a high level of fire danger - is in place until 18:00 (02:00 GMT) on Wednesday, with the strongest Santa Ana winds expected on Tuesday. Nearby, the largest fire is in the Palisades area, and has burnt through more than 23,000 acres. It is still only about 14% contained, despite the efforts of thousands of firefighters. The blaze is moving east, threatening the exclusive neighbourhood of Brentwood, home to the Getty Center, a world-famous art museum that has evacuated its staff. Another fire, Eaton, is more deadly than Palisades so far - responsible for 16 of the deaths. The overall destruction is immense, with more than 12,000 structures - homes, outbuildings, sheds, mobile homes and cars - destroyed. Celebrities Mel Gibson and Paris Hilton are among those who have lost their homes. Tens of thousands of homes are also without power. The fires could turn out to be the costliest in US history, with damage projected at up to $150bn, according to a preliminary estimate by AccuWeather. There are three active fires in the wider area, while a smaller fire is nearly contained, say California fire officials: The earlier Kenneth, Archer, Sunset, Lidia, Woodley and Olivasfires have been contained. Containment describes the progress firefighters make in controlling the spread of flames. It is often listed as a percentage. For example, if a fire is 14% contained, that means fire crews have established barriers around 14% of the fire's perimeter. Natural barriers include roads, rivers and oceans. Firefighters can also create barriers using equipment such as bulldozers, hoses and shovels to remove vegetation down to the bare soil, meaning there is nothing for the fire to burn. A fire being 100% contained doesn't mean it has been extinguished, but rather that the flames have been fully encircled and the spread has been effectively stopped. Detectives continue to investigate the possible causes. Lightning - the most common source of fires in the US - has been ruled out as a cause for the Palisades and Eaton fires. There has been no official indication so far that arson or utility lines - the next two biggest culprits in sparking fires - caused any of the conflagrations. However, in the case of the Eaton fire, legal cases have been filed against the electrical company, Southern California Edison Company (SCE), claiming there is evidence that the blaze - one of the largest - was ignited due to negligence of the firm's overhead wires."}
{"Article Number": 309, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyng762q4eo", "Text": "TikTok will be banned in the US on 19 January - unless the Supreme Court accepts alast ditch legal bid fromits Chinese owner, ByteDance, that to do so would be unconstitutional. But even if the country's highest judicial authority agrees with the lower courts - and Congress - that the platform is a threat to national security will that actually stop Americans using it? Will there be ways to bypass the ban - or could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop a law he says he opposed to, even if the courts uphold it. And whatever happens to TikTok, who stands to benefit from the uncertainty clouding its future? The most likely way the US would ban TikTok is to order app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, to make it unavailable for download in that region. US lawmakers have already told  tech firms to be ready to remove the app from their stores if a ban comes into force. That would mean people could no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok - though it would also mean people who've already got it would still have it on their phones. Because the app would not be publicly available anymore, new updates could no longer be delivered to users in the US - which would make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable. Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target. Of course, there are ways around such a ban. There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region. The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements. It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks. However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app. So if the ban took this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to. There are still other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether. And even if people did use a VPN, there are still ways TikTok could theoretically judge whether a person is based in the US - and then simply present them with a screen saying the app is not available in their country. It remains to be seen whether TikTok would decide to assist the government in its own ban - but it is being reported by Reuters that it plans to do so. TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US unless it rules in its favour."}

Photos of him and stories of people who have met him are incredibly rare. But now a man who got the secretive artist to work with children at a youth club in the late 1990s has given the BBC an exclusive insight into the man behind the murals, just as he was about to become famous. Banksy is one of the world's most famous graffiti artists. His work has sold for millions of pounds and his exhibitions seen by hundreds of thousands of people. But behind layers of paint, lost in time at a Bristol youth club, there's a Banksy very few people know about. On the cusp of international fame, the artist was leaving his mark - not only on the streets of his city, but on young people in Lawrence Weston. Here, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural. \"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building. \"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\" Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous. The artist would return to the club several times to create new works, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds – oblivious to who the artist would eventually become. It was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol. His friend had a suggestion – someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself. That person was Banksy. \"I got his phone number, so I used to call him up and ask if he'd come and do some art projects. He was really keen,\" Peter said. This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police. Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids. The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub. \"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society. \"It was always very vibrant.\" Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \"nobody thought twice about who he was\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston. He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said. \"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego. He was doing art with them, rather than doing art for them,\" he said. \"In the morning, he sat around a table with the children, talking about their ideas."}

Yoon, 64, is being investigated on charges of insurrection for a failed martial law order on 3 December that plunged the country into turmoil. He has also been impeached by parliament and suspended - but will only be removed from office if the Constitutional Court upholds the impeachment. However, Yoon's dramatic arrest on Wednesday brings to an end a weeks-long standoff between investigators and his presidential security team. Investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) failed to arrest him on 3 January after being locked in a six-hour stand-off with his security detail. But just before dawn on Wednesday, a much larger team of investigators and police arrived at his residence in central Seoul, armed with ladders to climb over buses blocking its entrance and bolt cutters to remove barbed wire. Other officers in the arrest team, which numbered around 1,000, scaled walls and hiked up nearby trails to reach the presidential residence. After several hours, authorities announced that Yoon had been arrested. In a three-minute video released just before his arrest, the 64-year-old leader said he would co-operate with the investigators, while repeating previous claims that the warrant was not legally valid. \"I decided to appear before the CIO, even though it is an illegal investigation, in order to prevent any unsavoury bloodshed,\" he said, adding that he witnessed officials \"invade\" his home's security perimeter with fire equipment. On Wednesday afternoon, investigators said Yoon had remained silent throughout questioning. Yoon's lawyers have said his arrest was \"illegal\" because the CIO, as an anti-corruption agency, has no power to investigate the insurrection allegations against Yoon. They also claim the warrant was issued by the wrong jurisdiction. The same court later dismissed an injunction filed by President Yoon to invalidate the arrest warrant, which the authorities maintain is lawful. The opposition Democratic Party's floor leader, Park Chan-dae, said Wednesday's arrest showed that \"justice in South Korea is alive\". This arrest \"is the first step toward restoring constitutional order, democracy and the rule of law\", he said during a party meeting. The country is currently being led by Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok as acting president. He was thrust into power after the first acting president,Han Duck-soo, was also impeachedby parliament, where the opposition has a sizeable majority. The clock has started ticking for investigators. Under the current warrant, they can hold Yoon for up to 48 hours from the point of arrest, after which they need a new warrant to detain him while he continues to be investigated. If that warrant is granted, they can detain him for up to 20 days before he is brought to trial. Without a new warrant, Yoon must be released."}

This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow whenKabul fell to the Taliban. Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns. Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban government expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\". Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports. How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me. \"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says. Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security. China, for example, has gone far: it has actively engaged with the Taliban government, focusing on security and economic interests, and even hasan ambassadorin the country. No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, but up to 40 countries maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with it. That's why experts like Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, are more circumspect about India's outreach. For the past three years, he says, India has maintained contact with the Taliban through a foreign service diplomat. India had closed its consulates in Afghanistan during the civil war in the 1990s and reopened them in 2002 after the war ended. \"We didn't want this hiatus to develop [again], so we wanted to engage. It is very simply a step up in relations,\" he says. India has\"historical and civilisational ties\" with Afghanistan, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament in 2023. India has invested more than $3bn (£2.46bn) in over 500 projects across Afghanistan, including roads, power lines, dams, hospitals and clinics. It has trained Afghan officers, awarded thousands of scholarships to students and built a new parliament building. This reflects a lasting geopolitical reality."}

The term \"clinical obesity\" should be used for patients with a medical condition caused by their weight, while \"pre-clinically obese\" should be applied to those remaining fat but fit, although at risk of disease. This is better for patients than relying only on body mass index (BMI) - which measures whether they are a healthy weight for their height - to determine obesity. More than a billion people are estimated to beliving with obesity worldwideand prescription weight-loss drugs are in high demand. The report, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, is supported by more than 50 medical experts around the world.  \"Some individuals with obesity can maintain normal organ function and overall health, even long term, whereas others display signs and symptoms of severe illness here and now,\" Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, who chaired the expert group, said. \"Obesity is a spectrum,\" he added. The current, blanket definition means too many people are being diagnosed as obese but not receiving the most appropriate care, the report says. Natalie, from Crewe, goes to the gym four times a week and has a healthy diet, but is still overweight. \"I would consider myself on the larger side, but I'm fit,\" she told the BBC 5 Live phone-in with Nicky Campbell. \"If you look at my BMI I'm obese, but if I speak to my doctor they say that I'm fit, healthy and there's nothing wrong with me. \"I'm doing everything I can to stay fit and have a long healthy life,\" she said. Richard, from Falmouth, said there is a lot of confusion around BMI. \"When they did my test, it took me to a level of borderline obesity, but my body fat was only 4.9% - the problem is I had a lot of muscle mass,\" he says. In Mike's opinion, you cannot be fat and fit - he says it is all down to diet. \"All these skinny jabs make me laugh, if you want to lose weight stop eating - it's easy.\" Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as havinga BMI over 30- a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight. It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared. For example, if they are 70kg (about 11 stone) and 1.70m (about 5ft 7in): Find out what your body mass index (BMI) means on the NHS website But BMI has limitations. It measures whether someone is carrying too much weight - but not too much fat. So very muscular people, such as athletes, tend to have a high BMI but not much fat. The report says BMI is useful on a large scale, to work out the proportion of a population who are a healthy weight, overweight or obese. But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs. Measuring a patient's waist or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says."}

There were reports of a breakthrough on Wednesday, with unnamed Israeli officials cited as saying that Hamas had agreed to the latest draft presented by Qatari, US and Egyptian mediators. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office however swiftly denied the reports. There was also no immediate comment from the Palestinian armed group. On Tuesday night, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said they were \"on the brink\" of an agreement and awaiting \"final word from Hamas\". A senior Hamas official later told Reuters news agency it had not delivered its official response to the draft because Israel had yet to submit maps showing how its troops would withdraw from areas of Gaza. However, Israel's Haaretz newspaper cited an Israeli source as denying Hamas's claim about the maps. The proposed three-phase deal would begin with an initial six-week ceasefire. A Palestinian official told the BBC that Hamas would release three hostages on the first day of a deal, after which Israel would begin withdrawing troops from populated areas. More hostage releases would then be staggered over the following weeks, he said, with Israel allowing displaced residents to return in northern areas. Israel has said it expects 33 hostages to be released in the first phase and that it will free a yet to be determined number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails in return. Negotiations for the second phase - which should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli troop withdrawal and a \"sustainable calm\" - would start after two weeks. Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman said on Tuesday that there were no major issues were blocking a deal and that he was hopeful the talks would \"very soon lead to an agreement\". However, he also warned that that \"the most minor detail\" could yet undermine the process. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 46,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of the 2.3 million population has also been displaced, there is widespread destruction, and there are severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter due to an struggle to get aid to those in need. Israel says 94 of the hostages are still being held by Hamas, of whom 34 are presumed dead. In addition, there are four Israelis who were abducted before the war, two of whom are dead. Relatives of the remaining hostages have urged the Israeli government to do whatever it takes to get a deal over the line and bring all of them home. \"We can't miss this moment. This is the last moment; we can save them,\" said Hadas Kalderon, the wife of Ofer Kalderon, a 54-year-old. Palestinians also dared to hope that an end to the devastating 15-month war was close."}
{"Article Number": 353, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m5r5zp0lno", "Text": "Winds that have fanned wildfires in the US city of Los Angeles are again expected to kick up on Wednesday - after a 25th death from the huge, week-long outbreak was confirmed. Forecasters have again identified an area of \"extreme fire danger\", emphasising the risk level in a region to the north-west of the city centre. In some mountainous areas, it is possible for winds to reach speeds of 70mph (113km/h), which would be nearly hurricane-force if they are sustained. The anticipated increase in speeds threatens to spread the remaining four blazes, which firefighters have made further progress in tackling during a few days of calmer conditions. Wind speeds began a slow and steady climb on Wednesday morning in parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. They are expected to peak during the day on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Compared with last week's conditions, winds are \"weaker but still strong\", the NWS cautions. There are hopes of another drop over the subsequent days - but officials have highlighted the need for rain that would help fire crews in their battle. \"The anticipated winds combined with low humidities and low fuel moistures will keep the fire threat in the LA region critical,\" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said during a news conference on Tuesday. Areas to the north-west of Los Angeles - including Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks - have been deemed to be particularly dangerous. An improvement in conditions is forecast later on Thursday and into Friday, says BBC Weather forecaster Sarah Keith-Lucas. But no rainfall is forecast for at least the next week - and the Santa Ana winds that have been blamed for stoking the blazes could again develop from Sunday. The fire chief for the city of Pasadena echoed the need for precipitation. There had been no \"real rain in southern California\" for more than 250 days, Chad Augustin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. His firefighters would spent Wednesday on \"standing guard ready to ensure that we hold our containment lines and we don't burn up any more structures\", Mr Augustin added. An extreme weather attribution study from climate scientists at 'Climameter' has concluded that the Californian wildfires have been fuelled by meteorological conditions strengthened by human-induced climate change. The study found that current conditions have been warmer, drier and windier compared with the past, in the areas affected by the fires. The 25th death from the fires was confirmed by the LA County Medical Examiner's Office. Thirteen other people remain missing. Most of the victims have died in the Eaton Fire, which has burned more than 14,000 acres to the city's north, but has now been 35% contained by firefighters. Further west, the larger Palisades Fire has torched more than 23,000 acres, and is now at 18% containment. Two smaller fires also continue to burn. Some of the victims of the Eaton Fire have now been allowed to return to their homes, although officials say they have no firm date for repopulation of the Palisades area, an upmarket area ravaged by the fire to which it lent its name."}

Efforts were made to get the treaty signed before President-elect Trump's inauguration on Monday, the BBC understands, and it had been expected the Mauritian cabinet would approve the proposal on Wednesday. The UK plans to hand over sovereignty of the cluster of islands in the Indian Ocean, but to maintain a 99-year lease over the joint UK and US military airbase on the largest island, Diego Garcia. A spokesman for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"perfectly reasonable for the US administration to consider the detail\" of any agreement. Shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said the latest development was \"complete humiliation\" for the prime minister because Labour had been \"desperate to sign off the surrender of the Chagos Islands before President Trump returns to office\". The deal has drawn criticism from other politicians in the UK as well as the incoming US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said it poses a \"serious threat\" to US securityby giving the islands to a country allied with China. Trump has not publicly commented on the deal. However Reform UK leader and Trump ally Nigel Farage told BBC Newsnight last year the agreement would damage Sir Keir's relations with the US president-elect. At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir defended the deal, saying the negotiations started under the last Tory government and insisting it was the best way to safeguard the military base. Reports had suggested Mauritian Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam would sign off an agreement on Wednesday as he attended a cabinet meeting, but it was later announced his attorney general was travelling to London to continue talks. The UK took control of the Chagos Islands, or British Indian Ocean Territory, from its then colony, Mauritius, in 1965 and went on to evict its population of more than 1,000 people to make way for the Diego Garcia base. Mauritius, which won independence from the UK in 1968, has maintained that the islands are its own, and the UN's highest court has ruled, in an advisory opinion, that the UK's administration of the territory is \"unlawful\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the prime minister was \"negotiating a secret deal to surrender British territory and taxpayers in this country will pay for the humiliation\". Badenoch said there was \"no way we should be giving up British territory in Chagos\", claiming Sir Keir was \"rushing a deal which will be disastrous\" and it would cost British taxpayers billions of pounds. The cost of the proposed deal to the UK has not been officially announced. In response to Badenoch, Sir Keir told PMQs the Chagos Islands negotiations were started under the last Tory government and the proposed deal would ensure the military base can continue operating effectively. A deal over the Chagos Islandswas first announced in Octoberfollowing years of negotiations."}

She had referred herself to the prime minister's standards adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, after questions about links to her aunt, who was ousted last year as Bangladesh's prime minister. Sir Laurie said he had \"not identified evidence of improprieties\" but it was \"regrettable\" that Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of the ties to her aunt. Siddiq said continuing in her role would be \"a distraction\" for the government but insisted she had done nothing wrong. Before her resignation was announced, Siddiq had been named in a second investigation in Bangladesh. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said the prime minister \"dithered and delayed to protect\" her. Writing on X, she said: \"It was clear at the weekend that the anti-corruption minister's position was completely untenable. Yet Keir Starmer dithered and delayed to protect his close friend. \"Even now, as Bangladesh files a criminal case against Tulip Siddiq, he expresses 'sadness' at her inevitable resignation. \"Weak leadership from a weak prime minister.\" In a letter accepting Siddiq's resignation, Sir Keir said the \"door remains open\" for her. Siddiq, whose role as Economic Secretary to the Treasuryincluded tackling corruption in UK financial markets,was named last month in an investigation into claims her family embezzled up to £3.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh. Her aunt is the former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, head of the Awami League, who fled into exile after being deposed last year. Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, also came under intense scrutiny over her use of properties in London linked to her aunt's allies. TheFinancial Times reportedthat one of the properties, a flat in King's Cross, had been given to her by a person connected with the recently ousted Bangladeshi government. According to the Mail on Sunday, in 2022 Siddiq had denied the flat was a gift and insisted her parents had bought it for her and had threatened the paper with legal action preventing publication of a story. Labour sources subsequently told the newspaper the flat had been gifted to Siddiq by a property developer with alleged links to her aunt. Sir Laurie spent eight days investigating the allegations after Siddiq referred herself to the standards watchdog. In his letter, Sir Laurie said Siddiq \"acknowledges that, over an extended period, she was unaware of the origins of her ownership of her flat in Kings Cross, despite having signed a Land Registry transfer form relating to the gift at the time\". He said the MP \"remained under the impression that her parents had given the flat to her, having purchased it from the previous owner\". This had led to the public being \"inadvertently misled\" about the identity of the donor of the flat, added Sir Laurie. Sir Laurie said this was an \"unfortunate misunderstanding\" which had led to Siddiq issuing a public correction of \"the origins of her ownership after she became a minister\"."}

They say the man also tried to get them to sign waivers which stated they did not accuse anyone of \"criminal wrongdoing\". The 11 survivors who have spoken to the BBC have also accused the Egyptian authorities of trying to cover up what happened, saying investigators were determined to blame it on a huge wave. The Sea Story had been carrying 46 people when it sank in the early hours of 25 November last year - four bodies were recovered and seven people are still missing, including two British divers. Neither the Egyptian government nor the boat operators - Dive Pro Liveaboard, based in Hurghada - have responded to our questions. On Tuesday,the BBC revealed multiple accusations from survivors of safety failingson board the vessel. A leading oceanographer who analysed weather data also said it was not plausible that a huge wave had hit the vessel. Within hours of being brought ashore, survivors say they were subjected to what one described as \"an interrogation\", some from their hospital beds, by people they were told were judges. Those who didn't need hospital treatment were interviewed at a nearby resort, said other survivors, who reported the same feelings of being pressured. \"We were told we couldn't leave the room until they'd done everybody's statements,\" says Sarah Martin, an NHS doctor from Lancashire. The judges were part of an Egyptian investigation into what caused the sinking - though survivors say it was not clear exactly who was leading it. The survivors say having their initial statements translated into Arabic by an employee of the company that owned the Sea Story was a clear conflict of interest. Spanish diver Hissora Gonzalez said the man did not initially introduce himself as an employee. \"He just said, 'You have to tell me what happened, and then you have to sign this piece of paper.'\" It was not until later, say several people we spoke to, that the man told them he worked for Dive Pro Liveaboard. The survivors say that, after being translated by the man, their statements were handed to investigators - something that shocked Lisa Wolf. \"A normal judge can't take a translation from someone that's obviously totally involved in the process.\" One survivor, who is a Norwegian police investigator, said she had \"no clue\" what the four pages of Arabic handed back to her actually said. \"They could have written anything. I don't know what I signed,\" Frøydis Adamson explained. Under her signature she says she wrote that she had not been able to read the documents. \"We were in such shock and just wanted to go home,\" said Hissora. Representatives of the boat operators, Dive Pro Liveaboard, also repeatedly tried to push people into signing waivers - say survivors - which would have seen them agreeing to the statement: \"I do not accuse anyone of any criminal wrongdoing."}

It is followed closely by Netflix's Spanish-language musical Emilia Pérez, which tells the story of a Mexican cartel leader who leaves the world of crime to live a new life as a transgender woman. The frontrunners in the Bafta acting categories include Cynthia Erivo and Demi Moore for lead actress and Adrien Brody and Timothee Chalamet for lead actor. But Denzel Washington and Daniel Craig failed to make the shortlist for Gladiator II and Queer respectively. Hugh Grant's nomination in the lead actor category for horror film Heretic, and Saoirse Ronan as leading actress for The Outrun, are among some of the surprises. Jamie Lee Curtis is nominated in the supporting actress category for The Last Showgirl, but the film's main actress Pamela Anderson, who plays an ageing Las Vegas performer, missed out on a nomination. The leading films in the Bafta nominations 12 nominations - Conclave 11 - Emilia Pérez 9 - The Brutalist 7 - Anora, Dune: Part Two and Wicked 6 - A Complete Unknown and Kneecap 5 - Nosferatu and The Substance Another film tipped for success in the current awards season is Anora, which has seven Bafta nominations including best film. It follows the whirlwind romance between a New York sex worker and the son of a wealthy Russian oligarch. Mikey Madison is nominated as leading actress and is also up for the rising star award, which is voted for by the public. Her co-star Yura Borisov is nominated for best supporting actor, and director Sean Baker has his first Bafta best director nomination. Half of those nominated in the best director category are first-time nominees and also include The Brutalist's Brady Corbet, who won the same award at the Golden Globes. The film, about a Hungarian architect who is hired by a wealthy American after World War Two, has nine nods in total and is also tipped to be a big contender at the Oscars. The Substance director Coralie Fargeat is another first-time directing nominee and is the only female nominated in the category. Demi Moore is nominated for best actress for the film, weeks after winning at the Golden Globes - putting her in a strong position for the Oscars. Conclave's Edward Berger is also nominated for best director, and thanked the \"wonderful crew\" who helped the film earn 12 nominations. He had found \"a team of like-minded people who bond together to strive for the unattainable goal - perfection\", he said. British actress Marianne Jean-Baptiste's nomination in the same category for playing an irritable woman struggling with depression in Hard Truths has boosted momentum for her to receive an Oscar nomination. The Bafta shortlist is often a strong indicator for the Oscars, and last year the winners of the top six categories matched perfectly at the two ceremonies. Another Oscar-tipped film is A Complete Unknown, which follows Bob Dylan's rise to fame in the 1960s."}

Ever\". The 64-year-old was accused on Monday of sexual misconduct by eight women, including four who had previously spoken out. On Tuesday, in a blog post titled Breaking The Silence, Gaiman said he had read the allegations with \"horror and dismay\". He wrote: \"I've stayed quiet until now, both out of respect for the people who were sharing their stories and out of a desire not to draw even more attention to a lot of misinformation.\" He continued: \"I've always tried to be a private person, and felt increasingly that social media was the wrong place to talk about important personal matters. I've now reached the point where I feel that I should say something. \"As I read through this latest collection of accounts, there are moments I half-recognise and moments I don't, descriptions of things that happened sitting beside things that emphatically did not happen. \"I'm far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.\" The fantasy graphic novel and science-fiction writer - whose books Good Omens, American Gods and The Sandman have been adapted for television - was the subject of a New York Magazine cover story on Monday. The magazine and its website Vulture reported allegations from eight women, four of whom also previously accused Gaiman of sexual assault in July 2024 on a Tortoise Media podcast. One of the women, who had been babysitting Gaiman's five-year-old child, alleged that he offered her a bath in his garden before joining her in the tub naked, asking her to sit on his lap, and that he sexually assaulted her. The British author said he read back text messages from the time of the alleged incidents and felt they were \"of two people enjoying entirely consensual sexual relationships\". \"At the time I was in those relationships, they seemed positive and happy on both sides,\" he wrote. He acknowledged that he was \"careless with people's hearts and feelings\" and could have \"done so much better\", but said he doesn't \"accept there was any abuse\". The author said he understood that \"not everyone will believe me\" and added he would be \"doing my very best to deserve their trust, as well as the trust of my readers\". He claimed some of the allegations \"simply never happened\" while others had been \"distorted\" to \"bear no relationship to reality\", but said he would \"take responsibility for any missteps I made\". A police report accusing Gaiman of a sexual assault was made in January 2023, but the investigation was eventually dropped. Since the allegations surfaced, several of Gaiman's film and TV projects have been affected. Season three of Prime Video's Good Omens will now comprise one 90-minute episode, with Gaiman no longer involved. Disney has paused production on its film adaptation of another Gaiman title, The Graveyard Book, while Netflix has cancelled Dead Boy Detectives, although it's not clear if this was related to the allegations."}

The findings come as negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appear to be nearing a breakthrough. Mediators in Qatar say talks are in their final stages, raising hopes that an agreement could be reached soon. The \"humanitarian zone\" was first established by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in October 2023 toprotect civilians and keep them out of harms way. On 6 May 2024, the IDF significantly expanded the zone to include the cities of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah. The area - much of which is a strip of land along the Mediterranean sea - is densely populated and is estimated to have over a million people living there according to international humanitarian organisations. Many people are living in tents, with limited infrastructure and limited access to aid. Local media reports indicate more than 550 people have been killed in the 97 strikes mapped by BBC Verify. In a statement to BBC Verify, the IDF said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating in the \"humanitarian zone\" and accused the group of violating international law while \"exploiting\" civilians as human shields and launching rockets from the area. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's 7 October 2023 attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. The conflict has caused widespread damage to infrastructure across Gaza, with satellite images showing areas flattened by Israeli strikes. The Hamas-run health ministry also says more than 46,600 people have been killed within the enclave since the start of the war. BBC Verify analysis suggests that attacks within the \"humanitarian zone\" have intensified since May 2024, with at least 22 strikes already recorded so far this month. We also cannot confirm that all incidents are the result of IDF attacks. Locations of strikes documented by BBC Verify were provided to the IDF but they did not confirm or deny their involvement. Israeli military officials have only publicly acknowledged 28 attacks since 6 May. Israel historically has not publicly acknowledged every strike it has carried out in Gaza. Gavin Kelleher, an access manager in Gaza for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said there were \"near daily\" strikes within the zone, including from Israeli ships and quadcopters, or small drones. He added that \"heavy fire is recurrent in this area despite its [Israel's] unilateral 'humanitarian' designation.\" \"The Israeli military appears keen to maintain the illusion of a Humanitarian Zone that remains a certain size, yet that zone can be subject to 'evacuation orders' at any time and be targeted,\" Mr Kelleher said. One resident who lives within the zone, Khaled Abdel Rahman, told the BBC that residents were being subjected to daily bombardments, frequently resulting in injuries and casualties. \"We were displaced to Khan Younis because it was designated as a safe zone, but in fact we find nothing here but insecurity,\" Mr Rahman said."}

Photos of him and stories of people who have met him are incredibly rare. But now a man who got the secretive artist to work with children at a youth club in the late 1990s has given the BBC an exclusive insight into the man behind the murals, just as he was about to become famous. Banksy is one of the world's most famous graffiti artists. His work has sold for millions of pounds and his exhibitions seen by hundreds of thousands of people. But behind layers of paint, lost in time at a Bristol youth club, there's a Banksy very few people know about. On the cusp of international fame, the artist was leaving his mark - not only on the streets of his city, but on young people in Lawrence Weston. Here, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural. \"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building. \"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\" Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous. The artist would return to the club several times to create new works, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds – oblivious to who the artist would eventually become. It was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol. His friend had a suggestion – someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself. That person was Banksy. \"I got his phone number, so I used to call him up and ask if he'd come and do some art projects. He was really keen,\" Peter said. This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police. Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids. The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub. \"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society. \"It was always very vibrant.\" Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \"nobody thought twice about who he was\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston. He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said. \"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego. He was doing art with them, rather than doing art for them,\" he said. \"In the morning, he sat around a table with the children, talking about their ideas."}

Inauguration day includes a formal swearing-in ceremony as well as musical performances, a celebratory parade and a number of formal balls. Vice-President-elect JD Vance will also take the oath of office, joining Trump on stage to officially begin their new administration. The inauguration is the formal ceremony that marks the end of one president's time in office and the start of their successor's administration. It is the most high-profile part of the transition of power between government leaders in Washington DC. A key part of the ceremony includes the president-elect reciting the oath of office: \"I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" Though he won the election in November, Trump officially becomes the 47th president once he says those words. He previously served as the 45th president between 2017 and 2021. Vance will also take an oath of office before he formally assumes the position of vice-president. Trump's second inauguration day will kick off with a service at St. John's Church, Lafayette Square, a historic Washington DC church, followed by tea at the White House. Musical performances and opening remarks are set to begin on the main event stage - located on the West Lawn of the US Capitol building - at 09:30 EST (14:30 GMT). That will be followed by the swearing-in of Trump and Vance as well as the inaugural address in which the president will set out his goals for the next four years. Trump will then head inside to the President's Room - near the Senate chamber - to sign key documents. He will then attend a lunch hosted by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. This is followed by a parade which goes from the Capitol building down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Later in the evening, Trump will appear at three inaugural balls throughout the city - the Commander-in-Chief Ball, the Liberty Inaugural Ball and the Starlight Ball. He is expected to speak at all three. There is typically high demand to watch the inauguration in person, and tickets are highly sought after. Members of Congress receive a certain number of tickets to the ceremony, which they can distribute to their constituents. These tickets are free, but often challenging to get. Americans can contact their congressperson directly for tickets. If you're not able to attend in person, there are plenty of ways to watch remotely. The White House will livestream the inauguration. The BBC will carry inauguration coverage live on our news channel. You can also watch a stream of the inauguration on our website and follow our live page, where we'll bring you updates, analysis and key moments as they happen. Local and federal officials are expecting around 200,000 people to show up in Washington DC, which could include Trump supporters and protestors."}
{"Article Number": 362, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyng762q4eo", "Text": "TikTok will be banned in the US on 19 January - unless the Supreme Court accepts alast ditch legal bid fromits Chinese owner, ByteDance, that to do so would be unconstitutional. But even if the country's highest judicial authority agrees with the lower courts - and Congress - that the platform is a threat to national security will that actually stop Americans using it? Will there be ways to bypass the ban - or could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop a law he says he opposed to, even if the courts uphold it. And whatever happens to TikTok, who stands to benefit from the uncertainty clouding its future? The most likely way the US would ban TikTok is to order app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, to make it unavailable for download in that region. US lawmakers have already told  tech firms to be ready to remove the app from their stores if a ban comes into force. That would mean people could no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok - though it would also mean people who've already got it would still have it on their phones. Because the app would not be publicly available anymore, new updates could no longer be delivered to users in the US - which would make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable. Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target. Of course, there are ways around such a ban. There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region. The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements. It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks. However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app. So if the ban took this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to. There are still other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether. And even if people did use a VPN, there are still ways TikTok could theoretically judge whether a person is based in the US - and then simply present them with a screen saying the app is not available in their country. It remains to be seen whether TikTok would decide to assist the government in its own ban - but it is being reported by Reuters that it plans to do so. TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US unless it rules in its favour."}

This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow whenKabul fell to the Taliban. Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns. Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban government expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\". Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports. How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me. \"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says. Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security. China, for example, has gone far: it has actively engaged with the Taliban government, focusing on security and economic interests, and even hasan ambassadorin the country. No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, but up to 40 countries maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with it. That's why experts like Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, are more circumspect about India's outreach. For the past three years, he says, India has maintained contact with the Taliban through a foreign service diplomat. India had closed its consulates in Afghanistan during the civil war in the 1990s and reopened them in 2002 after the war ended. \"We didn't want this hiatus to develop [again], so we wanted to engage. It is very simply a step up in relations,\" he says. India has\"historical and civilisational ties\" with Afghanistan, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament in 2023.

In a memo to staff, boss Mark Zuckerberg said he had made the decision to speed up the firm's regular performance-based cuts in anticipation of an \"intense year\". He said the company would \"backfill\" the roles later in 2025. The company, which employs about 72,000 people globally, did not say how the cuts would be distributed around the world. Workers in the US who are affected will know by 10 February, according to Mr Zuckerberg's memo. Those outside the US will be informed \"later\". \"This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams,\" he wrote. \"I've decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster.\" The move comes on the heels of other big decisions by Mr Zuckerberg, including moves to end the company's fact-checking and diversity programmes. Performance-based job cuts are common in corporate America. At Meta, they would normally unfold over the course of a year, Mr Zuckerberg said, but the process is being accelerated this year. Roughly 3,600 people could be affected this move. They will receive \"generous severance\", he said. The last big cuts at Meta came in 2023, when the companycut about 10,000 positionsin a cost-cutting drive after Mr Zuckerberg declared it the \"year of efficiency\". Itcut about 11,000 roles in 2022. Mr Zuckerberg also appears to be overhauling his own public image. On a recent podcast with Joe Rogan, Mr Zuckerberg said he thought companies needed more \"masculine energy\" and discussed taking up martial arts, which he said he enjoyed because he felt he could more fully express himself, than in his corporate role. \"When you're running a company, people typically don't wanna see you being like this ruthless person who's just like I'm gonna crush the people I'm competing with,\" he said. \"But when you're fighting, it's like no.\" \"I think in some ways when people see me competing in the sport they're like oh no, 'That's the real Mark.\" In an exclusive interview, Ian Russell tells the BBC that he believes there is \"no real movement\" within government on online safety.

She had referred herself to the prime minister's standards adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, after questions about links to her aunt, who was ousted last year as Bangladesh's prime minister. Sir Laurie said he had \"not identified evidence of improprieties\" but it was \"regrettable\" that Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of the ties to her aunt. Siddiq said continuing in her role would be \"a distraction\" for the government but insisted she had done nothing wrong. Before her resignation was announced, Siddiq had been named in a second investigation in Bangladesh. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said the prime minister \"dithered and delayed to protect\" her. Writing on X, she said: \"It was clear at the weekend that the anti-corruption minister's position was completely untenable. Yet Keir Starmer dithered and delayed to protect his close friend. \"Even now, as Bangladesh files a criminal case against Tulip Siddiq, he expresses 'sadness' at her inevitable resignation. \"Weak leadership from a weak prime minister.\" In a letter accepting Siddiq's resignation, Sir Keir said the \"door remains open\" for her. Siddiq, whose role as Economic Secretary to the Treasuryincluded tackling corruption in UK financial markets,was named last month in an investigation into claims her family embezzled up to £3.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh. Her aunt is the former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, head of the Awami League, who fled into exile after being deposed last year. Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, also came under intense scrutiny over her use of properties in London linked to her aunt's allies. TheFinancial Times reportedthat one of the properties, a flat in King's Cross, had been given to her by a person connected with the recently ousted Bangladeshi government. According to the Mail on Sunday, in 2022 Siddiq had denied the flat was a gift and insisted her parents had bought it for her and had threatened the paper with legal action preventing publication of a story. Labour sources subsequently told the newspaper the flat had been gifted to Siddiq by a property developer with alleged links to her aunt. Sir Laurie spent eight days investigating the allegations after Siddiq referred herself to the standards watchdog. In his letter, Sir Laurie said Siddiq \"acknowledges that, over an extended period, she was unaware of the origins of her ownership of her flat in Kings Cross, despite having signed a Land Registry transfer form relating to the gift at the time\". He said the MP \"remained under the impression that her parents had given the flat to her, having purchased it from the previous owner\". This had led to the public being \"inadvertently misled\" about the identity of the donor of the flat, added Sir Laurie. Sir Laurie said this was an \"unfortunate misunderstanding\" which had led to Siddiq issuing a public correction of \"the origins of her ownership after she became a minister\"."}
{"Article Number": 373, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyv433le3vno", "Text": "Drake has scrapped a legal case against Universal Music and Spotify, in which he accused the companies of conspiring to boost the streams of Kendrick Lamar's diss track against him, Not Like Us. The Canadian startook action last November, alleging that the music companies had used bots, payola and other methods to promote Lamar's song, which accused him of paedophilia. \"The record-shattering spread of Not Like Us on streaming, sales, and radio play was deliberate and appears to have relied upon irregular and inappropriate business practices,\" court documents alleged. However, on Tuesday, Drake's lawyers voluntarily withdrew a pre-action filing, effectively ending the case. According to court documents filed in New York, the star met with representatives of Spotify and Universal on Tuesday to discuss the case. Spotify, which had filed an opposition, had no objection to the withdrawal and discontinuance. Universal, which hadn't filed an opposition, reserved its position. A related case, filed against Universal and radio network iHeartRadio in Texas, is still active.  Not Like Us was widely regarded as the decisive blow in a long-running feud between Drake and Lamar, which dates back to the early 2010s. In the lyrics, Lamar alleges that Drake \"likes 'em young\" and accuses him of using other, more credible rappers, to boost his profile. Around 24 hours later, Drake responded with a track called The Heart Part 6, where he rejected the allegations, saying, \"I never been with no one under age\". He also  claimed to have fed Lamar \"false\" information through a double agent. However, his retort failed to attract the same attention as Not Like Us, which debuted at number one in the US chart and attracted more than 1 billion streams on Spotify. Taking to the courts, Drake accused Universal - which distributes both his music and Lamar's - of artificially boosting the song's numbers. In court documents, he claimed that the label licensed the song \"at drastically reduced rates to Spotify\" and used bots to stream the song, generating \"the false impression that the song was more popular than it was in reality\".  The papers were not a lawsuit, but a \"pre-action petition\", in which Drake's lawyers sought to gain access to internal documents at Spotify and Universal which might have supported their case. In a statement at the time, Universal told the BBC: \"The suggestion that [the company] would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue. \"We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns. No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\" Spotify also responded that there was \"no economic incentive for users to stream Not Like Us over any of Drake's tracks\". The Swedish streaming company later filed an opposition brief to Drake's petition, stating that it \"should be denied\". Music industry experts had been sceptical that the accusations would ever reach trial."}

Some horses came solo, others in trailers packed with fellow animals. Many had their owners, but others arrived alone, brought in by their rescuers or animal control. Pigs, donkeys and miniature horses followed. Within 24 hours, the Los Angeles Equestrian Center had been transformed into a modern-day Noah's Ark. Over the last week, it has sheltered hundreds of animals from the disaster as part of its official role as one of the city's large animal shelters. The facility, tucked in the shadow of Griffith Park, has taken in more than 200 horses, on top of the roughly 500 already living there.  Last Tuesday and Wednesday were \"chaos\", said Jennie Nevin, a spokeswoman for the equestrian centre. The facility catalogued every horse that arrived, making sure they could be reunited. Sheltering the animals came at no cost for the owners, thanks to the support of public donations and frequent drop-offs of free hay, feed and other supplies. Sergio Marcial was one of dozens of people who brought animals here after their own facilities were destroyed or threatened. A week ago, he and his girlfriend Jenny Bacon raced to help rescue more than 70 animals from theEaton Dam Stables while battling flames so intense that his face mask caught fire and his eyeglasses shattered and warped. His efforts landed him in the hospital, his lungs and throat burned after inhaling the torched air. One week later, Mr Marcial, 29, and Ms Bacon, 30, walked Arthur and Playboy - two miniature horses he helped save that night - around their new home. Here, they were safe from the fires, and they seemed calm and friendly despite everything they had endured. \"It still hurts to swallow,\" Mr Marcial said, pointing to a face mask he's required to wear to prevent infections. \"I'd do it all again - no question.\" Most of the sheltered animals' owners have been identified, and several owners spent Tuesday afternoon walking their horses around the stables. Dozens of volunteers cared for the other animals staying at the centre. Some had become local celebrities. Two donkeys, Morris and Mika, frequently poked their heads out of their stables to demand attention. They had fled down the mountain with their owner as the Palisades fire drew near, and were reunited because he had spray-painted his number on to their sides. \"They love for you to sing to them,\" said volunteer Lucena Herrera. \"We've all just been adopting them and taking care of them.\" But a handful of animals still have not been claimed. A miniature horse named Izzy had still not found her owner a week after the fires. The volunteers had collectively adopted her until she could find a new, permanent home.  So many volunteers showed up to help the animals that the staff had to turn some away, Ms Nevin said. Between 50-100 volunteers now raked stalls, fed the animals, fluffed hay and serenaded Morris and Mika when they grew antsy."}

Public Service Cabinet Secretary Justin Muturi said that it took a call by President William Ruto to have his son released by the National Intelligence Service (NIS). Muturi is the first member of the cabinet to publicly criticise the government's handling of the spate of abductions in Kenya. In a statement to the police crime investigations unit on Tuesday, Muturi gave a detailed account of how his son, Leslie, was abducted on 22 June last year. Mr Ruto and the intelligence agency have not commented on his allegations. At least 80 people, including the minister's son, have been abducted in the last six months, according to a state-funded rights group. The wave of abductions started after protests against tax hikes last June, and have continued since then. Some of those abducted have been released following public pressure. Earlier this week, the minister told journalists that he had not received answers about the abduction of his son, despite reaching out to top security officials. Muturi said the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) subsequently urged him to record a statement with them, telling him the matter was still under investigation. In his statement to the DCI, Muturi recalled calling the inspector-general of police, the interior minister, the DCI head, the head of the intelligence agency and other top officials as he desperately looked for his son – but, he added, all were unable to help. He said that he also messaged Ruto, but later decided to visit his official residence to raise the matter directly with him. \"I then narrated the ordeal [to the president] including my interactions with various senior government officials who had been unable to help. I expressed my belief that NIS was holding my son,\" Muturi said in the statement. He said that the president made a joke about the issue and then made a call to the head of the intelligence agency, who promised to release his son in an hour. \"I heard the president ask [NIS director] Noordin Haji if he was holding my son. [He] confirmed that indeed he was holding my son and the president instructed him to release Leslie immediately,\" Muturi added. Muturi has faced calls from some government-allied politicians to resign for publicly criticising the government in which he serves. Foreign nationals have also been abducted, including prominent Tanzanian activist Maria Sarungi Tsehai, who on Monday narrated how she was kidnapped by armed men and released several hours later. Last year, Ugandan opposition leader Kizza Besigye was kidnapped in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, allegedly by Ugandan security officials, and taken across the border for trial by a court martial. Muturi's public mentioning of Ruto's name in connection with abductions is a defiant challenge to the president, and is seen as being against the principle of collective responsibility in government."}

Yoon, 64, is being investigated on charges of insurrection for a failed martial law order on 3 December that plunged the country into turmoil. He has also been impeached by parliament and suspended - but will only be removed from office if the Constitutional Court upholds the impeachment. However, Yoon's dramatic arrest on Wednesday brings to an end a weeks-long standoff between investigators and his presidential security team. Investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) failed to arrest him on 3 January after being locked in a six-hour stand-off with his security detail. But just before dawn on Wednesday, a much larger team of investigators and police arrived at his residence in central Seoul, armed with ladders to climb over buses blocking its entrance and bolt cutters to remove barbed wire. Other officers in the arrest team, which numbered around 1,000, scaled walls and hiked up nearby trails to reach the presidential residence. After several hours, authorities announced that Yoon had been arrested. In a three-minute video released just before his arrest, the 64-year-old leader said he would co-operate with the investigators, while repeating previous claims that the warrant was not legally valid. \"I decided to appear before the CIO, even though it is an illegal investigation, in order to prevent any unsavoury bloodshed,\" he said, adding that he witnessed officials \"invade\" his home's security perimeter with fire equipment. On Wednesday afternoon, investigators said Yoon had remained silent throughout questioning. Yoon's lawyers have said his arrest was \"illegal\" because the CIO, as an anti-corruption agency, has no power to investigate the insurrection allegations against Yoon. They also claim the warrant was issued by the wrong jurisdiction. The same court later dismissed an injunction filed by President Yoon to invalidate the arrest warrant, which the authorities maintain is lawful. The opposition Democratic Party's floor leader, Park Chan-dae, said Wednesday's arrest showed that \"justice in South Korea is alive\". This arrest \"is the first step toward restoring constitutional order, democracy and the rule of law\", he said during a party meeting. The country is currently being led by Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok as acting president. He was thrust into power after the first acting president,Han Duck-soo, was also impeachedby parliament, where the opposition has a sizeable majority. The clock has started ticking for investigators. Under the current warrant, they can hold Yoon for up to 48 hours from the point of arrest, after which they need a new warrant to detain him while he continues to be investigated. If that warrant is granted, they can detain him for up to 20 days before he is brought to trial. Without a new warrant, Yoon must be released."}

Wind speeds began a slow and steady climb on Wednesday morning in parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. They are expected to peak during the day on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Compared with last week's conditions, winds are \"weaker but still strong\", the NWS cautions. There are hopes of another drop over the subsequent days - but officials have highlighted the need for rain that would help fire crews in their battle. \"The anticipated winds combined with low humidities and low fuel moistures will keep the fire threat in the LA region critical,\" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said during a news conference on Tuesday. Areas to the north-west of Los Angeles - including Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks - have been deemed to be particularly dangerous. An improvement in conditions is forecast later on Thursday and into Friday, says BBC Weather forecaster Sarah Keith-Lucas. But no rainfall is forecast for at least the next week - and the Santa Ana winds that have been blamed for stoking the blazes could again develop from Sunday. The fire chief for the city of Pasadena echoed the need for precipitation. There had been no \"real rain in southern California\" for more than 250 days, Chad Augustin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. His firefighters would spent Wednesday on \"standing guard ready to ensure that we hold our containment lines and we don't burn up any more structures\", Mr Augustin added. An extreme weather attribution study from climate scientists at 'Climameter' has concluded that the Californian wildfires have been fuelled by meteorological conditions strengthened by human-induced climate change. The study found that current conditions have been warmer, drier and windier compared with the past, in the areas affected by the fires. The 25th death from the fires was confirmed by the LA County Medical Examiner's Office. Thirteen other people remain missing. Most of the victims have died in the Eaton Fire, which has burned more than 14,000 acres to the city's north, but has now been 35% contained by firefighters. Further west, the larger Palisades Fire has torched more than 23,000 acres, and is now at 18% containment. Two smaller fires also continue to burn. Some of the victims of the Eaton Fire have now been allowed to return to their homes, although officials say they have no firm date for repopulation of the Palisades area, an upmarket area ravaged by the fire to which it lent its name."}

This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow whenKabul fell to the Taliban. Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns. Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban government expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\". Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports. How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me. \"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says. Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security. China, for example, has gone far: it has actively engaged with the Taliban government, focusing on security and economic interests, and even hasan ambassadorin the country. No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, but up to 40 countries maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with it. That's why experts like Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, are more circumspect about India's outreach. For the past three years, he says, India has maintained contact with the Taliban through a foreign service diplomat. India had closed its consulates in Afghanistan during the civil war in the 1990s and reopened them in 2002 after the war ended. \"We didn't want this hiatus to develop [again], so we wanted to engage. It is very simply a step up in relations,\" he says. India has\"historical and civilisational ties\" with Afghanistan, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament in 2023. India has invested more than $3bn (£2.46bn) in over 500 projects across Afghanistan, including roads, power lines, dams, hospitals and clinics. It has trained Afghan officers, awarded thousands of scholarships to students and built a new parliament building. This reflects a lasting geopolitical reality."}

The term \"clinical obesity\" should be used for patients with a medical condition caused by their weight, while \"pre-clinically obese\" should be applied to those remaining fat but fit, although at risk of disease. This is better for patients than relying only on body mass index (BMI) - which measures whether they are a healthy weight for their height - to determine obesity. More than a billion people are estimated to beliving with obesity worldwideand prescription weight-loss drugs are in high demand. The report, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, is supported by more than 50 medical experts around the world.  \"Some individuals with obesity can maintain normal organ function and overall health, even long term, whereas others display signs and symptoms of severe illness here and now,\" Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, who chaired the expert group, said. \"Obesity is a spectrum,\" he added. The current, blanket definition means too many people are being diagnosed as obese but not receiving the most appropriate care, the report says. Natalie, from Crewe, goes to the gym four times a week and has a healthy diet, but is still overweight. \"I would consider myself on the larger side, but I'm fit,\" she told the BBC 5 Live phone-in with Nicky Campbell. \"If you look at my BMI I'm obese, but if I speak to my doctor they say that I'm fit, healthy and there's nothing wrong with me. \"I'm doing everything I can to stay fit and have a long healthy life,\" she said. Richard, from Falmouth, said there is a lot of confusion around BMI. \"When they did my test, it took me to a level of borderline obesity, but my body fat was only 4.9% - the problem is I had a lot of muscle mass,\" he says. In Mike's opinion, you cannot be fat and fit - he says it is all down to diet. \"All these skinny jabs make me laugh, if you want to lose weight stop eating - it's easy.\" Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as havinga BMI over 30- a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight. It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared. For example, if they are 70kg (about 11 stone) and 1.70m (about 5ft 7in): Find out what your body mass index (BMI) means on the NHS website But BMI has limitations. It measures whether someone is carrying too much weight - but not too much fat. So very muscular people, such as athletes, tend to have a high BMI but not much fat. The report says BMI is useful on a large scale, to work out the proportion of a population who are a healthy weight, overweight or obese. But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs. Measuring a patient's waist or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says."}

There were reports of a breakthrough on Wednesday, with unnamed Israeli officials cited as saying that Hamas had agreed to the latest draft presented by Qatari, US and Egyptian mediators. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office however swiftly denied the reports. There was also no immediate comment from the Palestinian armed group. On Tuesday night, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said they were \"on the brink\" of an agreement and awaiting \"final word from Hamas\". A senior Hamas official later told Reuters news agency it had not delivered its official response to the draft because Israel had yet to submit maps showing how its troops would withdraw from areas of Gaza. However, Israel's Haaretz newspaper cited an Israeli source as denying Hamas's claim about the maps. The proposed three-phase deal would begin with an initial six-week ceasefire. A Palestinian official told the BBC that Hamas would release three hostages on the first day of a deal, after which Israel would begin withdrawing troops from populated areas. More hostage releases would then be staggered over the following weeks, he said, with Israel allowing displaced residents to return in northern areas. Israel has said it expects 33 hostages to be released in the first phase and that it will free a yet to be determined number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails in return. Negotiations for the second phase - which should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli troop withdrawal and a \"sustainable calm\" - would start after two weeks. Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman said on Tuesday that there were no major issues were blocking a deal and that he was hopeful the talks would \"very soon lead to an agreement\". However, he also warned that that \"the most minor detail\" could yet undermine the process. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 46,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of the 2.3 million population has also been displaced, there is widespread destruction, and there are severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter due to an struggle to get aid to those in need. Israel says 94 of the hostages are still being held by Hamas, of whom 34 are presumed dead. In addition, there are four Israelis who were abducted before the war, two of whom are dead. Relatives of the remaining hostages have urged the Israeli government to do whatever it takes to get a deal over the line and bring all of them home. \"We can't miss this moment. This is the last moment; we can save them,\" said Hadas Kalderon, the wife of Ofer Kalderon, a 54-year-old. Palestinians also dared to hope that an end to the devastating 15-month war was close."}

The changes, which are set to come into force from 27 January, are a U-turn from a policy introduced six years ago that allowed people to linger in Starbucks outlets and use their toilets without making a purchase. The move is part of the \"back to Starbucks\" strategy - a plan announced by the firm's new boss as he tries to tackle flagging sales. Starbucks said there was no change to its policy in the UK, where customers can continue to use the facilities without purchasing anything. The world's biggest coffee chain says its new code of conduct - which also addresses harassment and bans smoking and outside alcohol - aims to make its stores more welcoming. \"Implementing a Coffeehouse Code of Conduct... is a practical step that helps us prioritise our paying customers who want to sit and enjoy our cafes,\" a Starbucks spokesperson told BBC News. \"These updates are part of a broader set of changes we are making to enhance the cafe experience as we work to get back to Starbucks.\" The company said the new rules would be displayed at every store and staff would be instructed to ask anyone who violates the code of conduct to leave. That includes allowing employees to call the police when necessary. The change ends a policy Starbucks introduced in 2018 after two black men were arrested at one of the company's stores in Philadelphia. The men, one of whom had asked to use the toilet, had said they were waiting for a friend and refused a manager's request to leave. The video of the incident went viral, and critics accused the chain of racial profiling and called for a boycott. Starbucks apologised to the men, agreed a settlement, and to help counter the backlash announced it would welcome people into their cafes, whether or not they were customers. Starbucks has been trying to boost flagging sales as it grappled with a backlash to price increases and boycotts sparked by the Israel-Gaza war. Brian Niccol, who previously headed the Mexican food chain Chipotle, wasbrought into Starbucks last yearto help turn the business around. Mr Niccol has been trying to improve the customer experience at Starbucks' cafes byrevamping its menusand coffee shops.

{"Article Number": 384, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyxypryrnko", "Text": "At least 25people have died in the Los Angeles fires as two major blazes continue to burn across the sprawling US city. Firefighters made progress over the weekend in containing the Palisades and Eaton fires but warn that the return of high winds - forecast until Wednesday - could see these two spread again, or fuel new ones. The fires are already among the most destructive in LA's history when measured by the number of buildings destroyed. Rebuilding work will cost \"tens of billions\" of dollars, US President Joe Biden has said. An area to the north-west of the city centre is described by officials as \"particularly dangerous\". A red flag warning - indicating a high level of fire danger - is in place until 18:00 (02:00 GMT) on Wednesday, with the strongest Santa Ana winds expected on Tuesday. Nearby, the largest fire is in the Palisades area, and has burnt through more than 23,000 acres. It is still only about 14% contained, despite the efforts of thousands of firefighters. The blaze is moving east, threatening the exclusive neighbourhood of Brentwood, home to the Getty Center, a world-famous art museum that has evacuated its staff. Another fire, Eaton, is more deadly than Palisades so far - responsible for 16 of the deaths. The overall destruction is immense, with more than 12,000 structures - homes, outbuildings, sheds, mobile homes and cars - destroyed. Celebrities Mel Gibson and Paris Hilton are among those who have lost their homes. Tens of thousands of homes are also without power. The fires could turn out to be the costliest in US history, with damage projected at up to $150bn, according to a preliminary estimate by AccuWeather. There are three active fires in the wider area, while a smaller fire is nearly contained, say California fire officials: The earlier Kenneth, Archer, Sunset, Lidia, Woodley and Olivasfires have been contained. Containment describes the progress firefighters make in controlling the spread of flames. It is often listed as a percentage. For example, if a fire is 14% contained, that means fire crews have established barriers around 14% of the fire's perimeter. Natural barriers include roads, rivers and oceans. Firefighters can also create barriers using equipment such as bulldozers, hoses and shovels to remove vegetation down to the bare soil, meaning there is nothing for the fire to burn. A fire being 100% contained doesn't mean it has been extinguished, but rather that the flames have been fully encircled and the spread has been effectively stopped. Detectives continue to investigate the possible causes. Lightning - the most common source of fires in the US - has been ruled out as a cause for the Palisades and Eaton fires. There has been no official indication so far that arson or utility lines - the next two biggest culprits in sparking fires - caused any of the conflagrations. However, in the case of the Eaton fire, legal cases have been filed against the electrical company, Southern California Edison Company (SCE), claiming there is evidence that the blaze - one of the largest - was ignited due to negligence of the firm's overhead wires."}
{"Article Number": 385, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg45l9q62w4o", "Text": "Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's pick for defence secretary in his upcoming presidency, cleared his first hurdle on the way to confirmation: a long - and at times tense - hearing before the US Senate's Armed Services Committee. For more than four hours on Tuesday, Hegseth faced questions about his ability to run the defence department, including its three million employees and $849bn (£695bn) budget. And although he was grilled by Democrats overaccusations of sexual assault, infidelity and drinking in the workplace, he appears all but certain to be confirmed to the role after no Republicans came out against him. This was underscored later on Tuesday when Joni Ernst, one Republican who had been seen as a potential roadblock to his nomination, said she would support him. Here's a look at the five main takeaways from Hegseth's testimony. From the very start of his testimony,Hegseth, a military veteran,emphasised what he called a \"warrior culture\", vowing to return the focus of the defence department to the strength of America's military. \"Warfighting, lethality, meritocracy, standards, and readiness. That's it. That is my job,\" he said in his opening statements. As the hearing continued, Hegseth was critical of policies he felt harmed the efficiency and \"lethality\" of the military, namely efforts aimed at racial and gender diversity. \"This is not a time for equity,\" he said, adding that he opposes quotas, which he claims hurt morale. In what became an expectedly partisan hearing, Democrats repeatedly grilled Hegseth on his past statements suggesting women were not suited to serve in combat roles in the military. Questions along these lines from Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Mazie Hirono and Elizabeth Warren provided some of the most heated moments of the morning. He spoke over Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, as she tried to point to comments about female service members stretching back years. \"Mr Hegseth, I'm quoting you in a podcast: 'Women shouldn't be in combat at all',\" Warren said. Hegseth remained composed, responding by saying his concern was not women in combat, but simply maintaining \"standards\" in the military. Hegseth, who at 44 would be the youngest defence secretary in decades, also answered questions about his preparedness to run the defence department, a sprawling agency. The former Fox News host described himself as a \"change agent\", saying \"it's time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm.\" Some Republicans deemed Hegseth's lack of experience a strength. \"I just want to say for all the talk of experience and not coming from the same cocktail parties that permanent Washington is used to, you are a breath of fresh air,\" Senator Eric Schmitt, a Republican from Missouri, said. A graduate of Princeton and Harvard universities, Hegseth was an infantry platoon leader in Guantanamo Bay and Iraq, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. Hegseth, also a former Fox News TV host, has military experience in Afghanistan as well. Still, Democrats pressed Hegseth on his qualifications for the top military job."}

But even if the country's highest judicial authority agrees with the lower courts - and Congress - that the platform is a threat to national security will that actually stop Americans using it? Will there be ways to bypass the ban - or could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop a law he says he opposed to, even if the courts uphold it. And whatever happens to TikTok, who stands to benefit from the uncertainty clouding its future? The most likely way the US would ban TikTok is to order app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, to make it unavailable for download in that region. US lawmakers have already told  tech firms to be ready to remove the app from their stores if a ban comes into force. That would mean people could no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok - though it would also mean people who've already got it would still have it on their phones. Because the app would not be publicly available anymore, new updates could no longer be delivered to users in the US - which would make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable. Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target. Of course, there are ways around such a ban. There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region. The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements. It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks. However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app. So if the ban took this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to. There are still other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether. And even if people did use a VPN, there are still ways TikTok could theoretically judge whether a person is based in the US - and then simply present them with a screen saying the app is not available in their country. It remains to be seen whether TikTok would decide to assist the government in its own ban - but it is being reported by Reuters that it plans to do so. TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US unless it rules in its favour."}

It was amoment that had been in the making for weeks- ever since the last attempt to arrest Yoon on 3 January had failed after adramatic standoff. Yet, when the news of his arrest on came on Wednesday morning, it only seemed to create more uncertainty – and highlight the divide in a country that has already been deeply polarised by Yoon's short-lived martial law order and impeachment by parliament. \"This country is in crisis,\" said one pro-Yoon woman, tears streaming down her face. \"I've been praying since last night for a stable and peaceful South Korea.\" It's what both sides say they want but they cannot agree on how to get there. For the past month, a defiant 64-year-old Yoon was holed up inside his presidential compound in central Seoul, as his supporters and detractors rallied outside. They had turned Yongsan in central Seoul into an epicentre of protest, with tensions often running high. Hundreds of them had camped out overnight on Tuesday, as the arrest appeared imminent, in temperatures that plummeted to -8C. The only thing they shared was the food trucks keeping them warm with steaming drinks and instant noodles. Yoon's supporters jostled with the police officers - numbering 3,000 – who assembled to take him into custody. \"Don't call us stupid far-rights,\" one protester shouted, reflecting the frustration in the Yoon camp. A starkly different scene unfolded on the other side of the street. Opponents of Yoon, who had long called for his arrest, celebrated with chants and cheers. Their jubilation only made the pro-Yoon camp angrier, with some yelling: \"Don't taunt us - this is not funny.\" The gulf is not restricted to this corner of Yongsan. It has loomed over the whole country for more than a month. Yoon's shock announcement of martial law on 3 December almost instantly divided public opinion into two camps. While some believed his claims the country was under threat, a larger group viewed the move as an opportunistic abuse of power. This sentiment was reflected even within Yoon's own party, as several of its lawmakers voted to impeach him. The growing opposition to Yoon's actions has cast a pall over the nation. The year-end season in South Korea is usually vibrant. But this year has been noticeably different. The political turmoil – along with thedevastating Jeju Air crashon 29 December – has created a subdued and sombre atmosphere. Yoon himself had largely avoided the public since he was impeached by parliament in mid-December. He never stepped out of his residence to meet his supporters. On New Year's Day, he sent them a note, saying he was \"closely watching [them] via a YouTube livestream\". He skipped the first hearing of his impeachment trial on 14 January, delaying the proceedings. Before that he had refused to comply with multiple summonses as part of the criminal investigation on insurrection charges, which led to the arrest warrant."}

{"Article Number": 424, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg45zqz225vo", "Text": "Yoon Suk Yeol has become South Korea's first sitting president to be arrested after investigators scaled barricades and cut through barbed wire to take him into custody. Yoon, 64, is being investigated on charges of insurrection for a failed martial law order on 3 December that plunged the country into turmoil. He has also been impeached by parliament and suspended - but will only be removed from office if the Constitutional Court upholds the impeachment. However, Yoon's dramatic arrest on Wednesday brings to an end a weeks-long standoff between investigators and his presidential security team. Investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) failed to arrest him on 3 January after being locked in a six-hour stand-off with his security detail. But just before dawn on Wednesday, a much larger team of investigators and police arrived at his residence in central Seoul, armed with ladders to climb over buses blocking its entrance and bolt cutters to remove barbed wire. Other officers in the arrest team, which numbered around 1,000, scaled walls and hiked up nearby trails to reach the presidential residence. After several hours, authorities announced that Yoon had been arrested. In a three-minute video released just before his arrest, the 64-year-old leader said he would co-operate with the investigators, while repeating previous claims that the warrant was not legally valid. \"I decided to appear before the CIO, even though it is an illegal investigation, in order to prevent any unsavoury bloodshed,\" he said, adding that he witnessed officials \"invade\" his home's security perimeter with fire equipment. On Wednesday afternoon, investigators said Yoon had remained silent throughout questioning. Yoon's lawyers have said his arrest was \"illegal\" because the CIO, as an anti-corruption agency, has no power to investigate the insurrection allegations against Yoon. They also claim the warrant was issued by the wrong jurisdiction. The same court later dismissed an injunction filed by President Yoon to invalidate the arrest warrant, which the authorities maintain is lawful. The opposition Democratic Party's floor leader, Park Chan-dae, said Wednesday's arrest showed that \"justice in South Korea is alive\". This arrest \"is the first step toward restoring constitutional order, democracy and the rule of law\", he said during a party meeting. The country is currently being led by Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok as acting president. He was thrust into power after the first acting president,Han Duck-soo, was also impeachedby parliament, where the opposition has a sizeable majority. The clock has started ticking for investigators. Under the current warrant, they can hold Yoon for up to 48 hours from the point of arrest, after which they need a new warrant to detain him while he continues to be investigated. If that warrant is granted, they can detain him for up to 20 days before he is brought to trial. Without a new warrant, Yoon must be released."}
{"Article Number": 425, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yv4p95m6vo", "Text": "Tears, dismayed cries and shocked faces: that was the reaction among the supporters of South Korea's suspended president Yoon Suk Yeol outside his home on hearing that he had been arrested. It was amoment that had been in the making for weeks- ever since the last attempt to arrest Yoon on 3 January had failed after adramatic standoff. Yet, when the news of his arrest on came on Wednesday morning, it only seemed to create more uncertainty – and highlight the divide in a country that has already been deeply polarised by Yoon's short-lived martial law order and impeachment by parliament. \"This country is in crisis,\" said one pro-Yoon woman, tears streaming down her face. \"I've been praying since last night for a stable and peaceful South Korea.\" It's what both sides say they want but they cannot agree on how to get there. For the past month, a defiant 64-year-old Yoon was holed up inside his presidential compound in central Seoul, as his supporters and detractors rallied outside. They had turned Yongsan in central Seoul into an epicentre of protest, with tensions often running high. Hundreds of them had camped out overnight on Tuesday, as the arrest appeared imminent, in temperatures that plummeted to -8C. The only thing they shared was the food trucks keeping them warm with steaming drinks and instant noodles. Yoon's supporters jostled with the police officers - numbering 3,000 – who assembled to take him into custody. \"Don't call us stupid far-rights,\" one protester shouted, reflecting the frustration in the Yoon camp. A starkly different scene unfolded on the other side of the street. Opponents of Yoon, who had long called for his arrest, celebrated with chants and cheers. Their jubilation only made the pro-Yoon camp angrier, with some yelling: \"Don't taunt us - this is not funny.\" The gulf is not restricted to this corner of Yongsan. It has loomed over the whole country for more than a month. Yoon's shock announcement of martial law on 3 December almost instantly divided public opinion into two camps. While some believed his claims the country was under threat, a larger group viewed the move as an opportunistic abuse of power. This sentiment was reflected even within Yoon's own party, as several of its lawmakers voted to impeach him. The growing opposition to Yoon's actions has cast a pall over the nation. The year-end season in South Korea is usually vibrant. But this year has been noticeably different. The political turmoil – along with thedevastating Jeju Air crashon 29 December – has created a subdued and sombre atmosphere. Yoon himself had largely avoided the public since he was impeached by parliament in mid-December. He never stepped out of his residence to meet his supporters. On New Year's Day, he sent them a note, saying he was \"closely watching [them] via a YouTube livestream\". He skipped the first hearing of his impeachment trial on 14 January, delaying the proceedings. Before that he had refused to comply with multiple summonses as part of the criminal investigation on insurrection charges, which led to the arrest warrant."}
{"Article Number": 426, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8ke9e27dxo", "Text": "India's latest diplomatic outreach to Afghanistan's Taliban government signals a marked shift in how it sees the geopolitical reality in the region. This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow whenKabul fell to the Taliban. Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns. Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban government expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\". Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports. How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me. \"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says. Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security. China, for example, has gone far: it has actively engaged with the Taliban government, focusing on security and economic interests, and even hasan ambassadorin the country. No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, but up to 40 countries maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with it. That's why experts like Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, are more circumspect about India's outreach. For the past three years, he says, India has maintained contact with the Taliban through a foreign service diplomat. India had closed its consulates in Afghanistan during the civil war in the 1990s and reopened them in 2002 after the war ended. \"We didn't want this hiatus to develop [again], so we wanted to engage. It is very simply a step up in relations,\" he says. India has\"historical and civilisational ties\" with Afghanistan, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament in 2023. India has invested more than $3bn (£2.46bn) in over 500 projects across Afghanistan, including roads, power lines, dams, hospitals and clinics. It has trained Afghan officers, awarded thousands of scholarships to students and built a new parliament building. This reflects a lasting geopolitical reality."}

The term \"clinical obesity\" should be used for patients with a medical condition caused by their weight, while \"pre-clinically obese\" should be applied to those remaining fat but fit, although at risk of disease. This is better for patients than relying only on body mass index (BMI) - which measures whether they are a healthy weight for their height - to determine obesity. More than a billion people are estimated to beliving with obesity worldwideand prescription weight-loss drugs are in high demand. The report, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, is supported by more than 50 medical experts around the world.  \"Some individuals with obesity can maintain normal organ function and overall health, even long term, whereas others display signs and symptoms of severe illness here and now,\" Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, who chaired the expert group, said. \"Obesity is a spectrum,\" he added. The current, blanket definition means too many people are being diagnosed as obese but not receiving the most appropriate care, the report says. Natalie, from Crewe, goes to the gym four times a week and has a healthy diet, but is still overweight. \"I would consider myself on the larger side, but I'm fit,\" she told the BBC 5 Live phone-in with Nicky Campbell. \"If you look at my BMI I'm obese, but if I speak to my doctor they say that I'm fit, healthy and there's nothing wrong with me. \"I'm doing everything I can to stay fit and have a long healthy life,\" she said. Richard, from Falmouth, said there is a lot of confusion around BMI. \"When they did my test, it took me to a level of borderline obesity, but my body fat was only 4.9% - the problem is I had a lot of muscle mass,\" he says. In Mike's opinion, you cannot be fat and fit - he says it is all down to diet. \"All these skinny jabs make me laugh, if you want to lose weight stop eating - it's easy.\" Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as havinga BMI over 30- a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight. It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared. For example, if they are 70kg (about 11 stone) and 1.70m (about 5ft 7in): Find out what your body mass index (BMI) means on the NHS website But BMI has limitations. It measures whether someone is carrying too much weight - but not too much fat. So very muscular people, such as athletes, tend to have a high BMI but not much fat. The report says BMI is useful on a large scale, to work out the proportion of a population who are a healthy weight, overweight or obese. But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs. Measuring a patient's waist or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says."}

It was amoment that had been in the making for weeks- ever since the last attempt to arrest Yoon on 3 January had failed after adramatic standoff. Yet, when the news of his arrest on came on Wednesday morning, it only seemed to create more uncertainty – and highlight the divide in a country that has already been deeply polarised by Yoon's short-lived martial law order and impeachment by parliament. \"This country is in crisis,\" said one pro-Yoon woman, tears streaming down her face. \"I've been praying since last night for a stable and peaceful South Korea.\" It's what both sides say they want but they cannot agree on how to get there. For the past month, a defiant 64-year-old Yoon was holed up inside his presidential compound in central Seoul, as his supporters and detractors rallied outside. They had turned Yongsan in central Seoul into an epicentre of protest, with tensions often running high. Hundreds of them had camped out overnight on Tuesday, as the arrest appeared imminent, in temperatures that plummeted to -8C. The only thing they shared was the food trucks keeping them warm with steaming drinks and instant noodles. Yoon's supporters jostled with the police officers - numbering 3,000 – who assembled to take him into custody. \"Don't call us stupid far-rights,\" one protester shouted, reflecting the frustration in the Yoon camp. A starkly different scene unfolded on the other side of the street. Opponents of Yoon, who had long called for his arrest, celebrated with chants and cheers. Their jubilation only made the pro-Yoon camp angrier, with some yelling: \"Don't taunt us - this is not funny.\" The gulf is not restricted to this corner of Yongsan. It has loomed over the whole country for more than a month. Yoon's shock announcement of martial law on 3 December almost instantly divided public opinion into two camps. While some believed his claims the country was under threat, a larger group viewed the move as an opportunistic abuse of power. This sentiment was reflected even within Yoon's own party, as several of its lawmakers voted to impeach him. The growing opposition to Yoon's actions has cast a pall over the nation. The year-end season in South Korea is usually vibrant. But this year has been noticeably different. The political turmoil – along with thedevastating Jeju Air crashon 29 December – has created a subdued and sombre atmosphere. Yoon himself had largely avoided the public since he was impeached by parliament in mid-December. He never stepped out of his residence to meet his supporters. On New Year's Day, he sent them a note, saying he was \"closely watching [them] via a YouTube livestream\". He skipped the first hearing of his impeachment trial on 14 January, delaying the proceedings. Before that he had refused to comply with multiple summonses as part of the criminal investigation on insurrection charges, which led to the arrest warrant."}

There were reports of a breakthrough on Wednesday, with unnamed Israeli officials cited as saying that Hamas had agreed to the latest draft presented by Qatari, US and Egyptian mediators. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office however swiftly denied the reports. There was also no immediate comment from the Palestinian armed group. On Tuesday night, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said they were \"on the brink\" of an agreement and awaiting \"final word from Hamas\". A senior Hamas official later told Reuters news agency it had not delivered its official response to the draft because Israel had yet to submit maps showing how its troops would withdraw from areas of Gaza. However, Israel's Haaretz newspaper cited an Israeli source as denying Hamas's claim about the maps. The proposed three-phase deal would begin with an initial six-week ceasefire. A Palestinian official told the BBC that Hamas would release three hostages on the first day of a deal, after which Israel would begin withdrawing troops from populated areas. More hostage releases would then be staggered over the following weeks, he said, with Israel allowing displaced residents to return in northern areas. Israel has said it expects 33 hostages to be released in the first phase and that it will free a yet to be determined number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails in return. Negotiations for the second phase - which should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli troop withdrawal and a \"sustainable calm\" - would start after two weeks. Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman said on Tuesday that there were no major issues were blocking a deal and that he was hopeful the talks would \"very soon lead to an agreement\". However, he also warned that that \"the most minor detail\" could yet undermine the process. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 46,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of the 2.3 million population has also been displaced, there is widespread destruction, and there are severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter due to an struggle to get aid to those in need. Israel says 94 of the hostages are still being held by Hamas, of whom 34 are presumed dead. In addition, there are four Israelis who were abducted before the war, two of whom are dead. Relatives of the remaining hostages have urged the Israeli government to do whatever it takes to get a deal over the line and bring all of them home. \"We can't miss this moment. This is the last moment; we can save them,\" said Hadas Kalderon, the wife of Ofer Kalderon, a 54-year-old. Palestinians also dared to hope that an end to the devastating 15-month war was close."}

Forecasters have again identified an area of \"extreme fire danger\", emphasising the risk level in a region to the north-west of the city centre. In some mountainous areas, it is possible for winds to reach speeds of 70mph (113km/h), which would be nearly hurricane-force if they are sustained. The anticipated increase in speeds threatens to spread the remaining four blazes, which firefighters have made further progress in tackling during a few days of calmer conditions. Wind speeds began a slow and steady climb on Wednesday morning in parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. They are expected to peak during the day on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Compared with last week's conditions, winds are \"weaker but still strong\", the NWS cautions. There are hopes of another drop over the subsequent days - but officials have highlighted the need for rain that would help fire crews in their battle. \"The anticipated winds combined with low humidities and low fuel moistures will keep the fire threat in the LA region critical,\" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said during a news conference on Tuesday. Areas to the north-west of Los Angeles - including Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks - have been deemed to be particularly dangerous. An improvement in conditions is forecast later on Thursday and into Friday, says BBC Weather forecaster Sarah Keith-Lucas. But no rainfall is forecast for at least the next week - and the Santa Ana winds that have been blamed for stoking the blazes could again develop from Sunday. The fire chief for the city of Pasadena echoed the need for precipitation. There had been no \"real rain in southern California\" for more than 250 days, Chad Augustin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. His firefighters would spent Wednesday on \"standing guard ready to ensure that we hold our containment lines and we don't burn up any more structures\", Mr Augustin added. An extreme weather attribution study from climate scientists at 'Climameter' has concluded that the Californian wildfires have been fuelled by meteorological conditions strengthened by human-induced climate change. The study found that current conditions have been warmer, drier and windier compared with the past, in the areas affected by the fires. The 25th death from the fires was confirmed by the LA County Medical Examiner's Office. Thirteen other people remain missing. Most of the victims have died in the Eaton Fire, which has burned more than 14,000 acres to the city's north, but has now been 35% contained by firefighters. Further west, the larger Palisades Fire has torched more than 23,000 acres, and is now at 18% containment. Two smaller fires also continue to burn. Some of the victims of the Eaton Fire have now been allowed to return to their homes, although officials say they have no firm date for repopulation of the Palisades area, an upmarket area ravaged by the fire to which it lent its name."}

Efforts were made to get the treaty signed before President-elect Trump's inauguration on Monday, the BBC understands, and it had been expected the Mauritian cabinet would approve the proposal on Wednesday. The UK plans to hand over sovereignty of the cluster of islands in the Indian Ocean, but to maintain a 99-year lease over the joint UK and US military airbase on the largest island, Diego Garcia. A spokesman for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"perfectly reasonable for the US administration to consider the detail\" of any agreement. Shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said the latest development was \"complete humiliation\" for the prime minister because Labour had been \"desperate to sign off the surrender of the Chagos Islands before President Trump returns to office\". The deal has drawn criticism from other politicians in the UK as well as the incoming US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said it poses a \"serious threat\" to US securityby giving the islands to a country allied with China. Trump has not publicly commented on the deal. However Reform UK leader and Trump ally Nigel Farage told BBC Newsnight last year the agreement would damage Sir Keir's relations with the US president-elect. At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir defended the deal, saying the negotiations started under the last Tory government and insisting it was the best way to safeguard the military base. Reports had suggested Mauritian Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam would sign off an agreement on Wednesday as he attended a cabinet meeting, but it was later announced his attorney general was travelling to London to continue talks. The UK took control of the Chagos Islands, or British Indian Ocean Territory, from its then colony, Mauritius, in 1965 and went on to evict its population of more than 1,000 people to make way for the Diego Garcia base. Mauritius, which won independence from the UK in 1968, has maintained that the islands are its own, and the UN's highest court has ruled, in an advisory opinion, that the UK's administration of the territory is \"unlawful\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the prime minister was \"negotiating a secret deal to surrender British territory and taxpayers in this country will pay for the humiliation\". Badenoch said there was \"no way we should be giving up British territory in Chagos\", claiming Sir Keir was \"rushing a deal which will be disastrous\" and it would cost British taxpayers billions of pounds. The cost of the proposed deal to the UK has not been officially announced. In response to Badenoch, Sir Keir told PMQs the Chagos Islands negotiations were started under the last Tory government and the proposed deal would ensure the military base can continue operating effectively.

She had referred herself to the prime minister's standards adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, after questions about links to her aunt, who was ousted last year as Bangladesh's prime minister. Sir Laurie said he had \"not identified evidence of improprieties\" but it was \"regrettable\" that Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of the ties to her aunt. Siddiq said continuing in her role would be \"a distraction\" for the government but insisted she had done nothing wrong. Before her resignation was announced, Siddiq had been named in a second investigation in Bangladesh. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said the prime minister \"dithered and delayed to protect\" her. Writing on X, she said: \"It was clear at the weekend that the anti-corruption minister's position was completely untenable. Yet Keir Starmer dithered and delayed to protect his close friend. \"Even now, as Bangladesh files a criminal case against Tulip Siddiq, he expresses 'sadness' at her inevitable resignation. \"Weak leadership from a weak prime minister.\" In a letter accepting Siddiq's resignation, Sir Keir said the \"door remains open\" for her. Siddiq, whose role as Economic Secretary to the Treasuryincluded tackling corruption in UK financial markets,was named last month in an investigation into claims her family embezzled up to £3.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh. Her aunt is the former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, head of the Awami League, who fled into exile after being deposed last year. Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, also came under intense scrutiny over her use of properties in London linked to her aunt's allies. TheFinancial Times reportedthat one of the properties, a flat in King's Cross, had been given to her by a person connected with the recently ousted Bangladeshi government. According to the Mail on Sunday, in 2022 Siddiq had denied the flat was a gift and insisted her parents had bought it for her and had threatened the paper with legal action preventing publication of a story. Labour sources subsequently told the newspaper the flat had been gifted to Siddiq by a property developer with alleged links to her aunt. Sir Laurie spent eight days investigating the allegations after Siddiq referred herself to the standards watchdog. In his letter, Sir Laurie said Siddiq \"acknowledges that, over an extended period, she was unaware of the origins of her ownership of her flat in Kings Cross, despite having signed a Land Registry transfer form relating to the gift at the time\". He said the MP \"remained under the impression that her parents had given the flat to her, having purchased it from the previous owner\". This had led to the public being \"inadvertently misled\" about the identity of the donor of the flat, added Sir Laurie. Sir Laurie said this was an \"unfortunate misunderstanding\" which had led to Siddiq issuing a public correction of \"the origins of her ownership after she became a minister\"."}

They say the man also tried to get them to sign waivers which stated they did not accuse anyone of \"criminal wrongdoing\". The 11 survivors who have spoken to the BBC have also accused the Egyptian authorities of trying to cover up what happened, saying investigators were determined to blame it on a huge wave. The Sea Story had been carrying 46 people when it sank in the early hours of 25 November last year - four bodies were recovered and seven people are still missing, including two British divers. Neither the Egyptian government nor the boat operators - Dive Pro Liveaboard, based in Hurghada - have responded to our questions. On Tuesday,the BBC revealed multiple accusations from survivors of safety failingson board the vessel. A leading oceanographer who analysed weather data also said it was not plausible that a huge wave had hit the vessel. Within hours of being brought ashore, survivors say they were subjected to what one described as \"an interrogation\", some from their hospital beds, by people they were told were judges. Those who didn't need hospital treatment were interviewed at a nearby resort, said other survivors, who reported the same feelings of being pressured. \"We were told we couldn't leave the room until they'd done everybody's statements,\" says Sarah Martin, an NHS doctor from Lancashire. The judges were part of an Egyptian investigation into what caused the sinking - though survivors say it was not clear exactly who was leading it. The survivors say having their initial statements translated into Arabic by an employee of the company that owned the Sea Story was a clear conflict of interest. Spanish diver Hissora Gonzalez said the man did not initially introduce himself as an employee. \"He just said, 'You have to tell me what happened, and then you have to sign this piece of paper.'\" It was not until later, say several people we spoke to, that the man told them he worked for Dive Pro Liveaboard. The survivors say that, after being translated by the man, their statements were handed to investigators - something that shocked Lisa Wolf. \"A normal judge can't take a translation from someone that's obviously totally involved in the process.\" One survivor, who is a Norwegian police investigator, said she had \"no clue\" what the four pages of Arabic handed back to her actually said. \"They could have written anything. I don't know what I signed,\" Frøydis Adamson explained. Under her signature she says she wrote that she had not been able to read the documents. \"We were in such shock and just wanted to go home,\" said Hissora. Representatives of the boat operators, Dive Pro Liveaboard, also repeatedly tried to push people into signing waivers - say survivors - which would have seen them agreeing to the statement: \"I do not accuse anyone of any criminal wrongdoing."}

The frontrunners in the Bafta acting categories include Cynthia Erivo and Demi Moore for lead actress and Adrien Brody and Timothee Chalamet for lead actor. But Denzel Washington and Daniel Craig failed to make the shortlist for Gladiator II and Queer respectively. Hugh Grant's nomination in the lead actor category for horror film Heretic, and Saoirse Ronan as leading actress for The Outrun, are among some of the surprises.

Her co-star Yura Borisov is nominated for best supporting actor, and director Sean Baker has his first Bafta best director nomination. Half of those nominated in the best director category are first-time nominees and also include The Brutalist's Brady Corbet, who won the same award at the Golden Globes. The film, about a Hungarian architect who is hired by a wealthy American after World War Two, has nine nods in total and is also tipped to be a big contender at the Oscars. The Substance director Coralie Fargeat is another first-time directing nominee and is the only female nominated in the category. Demi Moore is nominated for best actress for the film, weeks after winning at the Golden Globes - putting her in a strong position for the Oscars. Conclave's Edward Berger is also nominated for best director, and thanked the \"wonderful crew\" who helped the film earn 12 nominations. He had found \"a team of like-minded people who bond together to strive for the unattainable goal - perfection\", he said. British actress Marianne Jean-Baptiste's nomination in the same category for playing an irritable woman struggling with depression in Hard Truths has boosted momentum for her to receive an Oscar nomination.

Ever\". The 64-year-old was accused on Monday of sexual misconduct by eight women, including four who had previously spoken out. On Tuesday, in a blog post titled Breaking The Silence, Gaiman said he had read the allegations with \"horror and dismay\". He wrote: \"I've stayed quiet until now, both out of respect for the people who were sharing their stories and out of a desire not to draw even more attention to a lot of misinformation.\" He continued: \"I've always tried to be a private person, and felt increasingly that social media was the wrong place to talk about important personal matters. I've now reached the point where I feel that I should say something. \"As I read through this latest collection of accounts, there are moments I half-recognise and moments I don't, descriptions of things that happened sitting beside things that emphatically did not happen. \"I'm far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.\" The fantasy graphic novel and science-fiction writer - whose books Good Omens, American Gods and The Sandman have been adapted for television - was the subject of a New York Magazine cover story on Monday. The magazine and its website Vulture reported allegations from eight women, four of whom also previously accused Gaiman of sexual assault in July 2024 on a Tortoise Media podcast. One of the women, who had been babysitting Gaiman's five-year-old child, alleged that he offered her a bath in his garden before joining her in the tub naked, asking her to sit on his lap, and that he sexually assaulted her. The British author said he read back text messages from the time of the alleged incidents and felt they were \"of two people enjoying entirely consensual sexual relationships\". \"At the time I was in those relationships, they seemed positive and happy on both sides,\" he wrote. He acknowledged that he was \"careless with people's hearts and feelings\" and could have \"done so much better\", but said he doesn't \"accept there was any abuse\". The author said he understood that \"not everyone will believe me\" and added he would be \"doing my very best to deserve their trust, as well as the trust of my readers\". He claimed some of the allegations \"simply never happened\" while others had been \"distorted\" to \"bear no relationship to reality\", but said he would \"take responsibility for any missteps I made\". A police report accusing Gaiman of a sexual assault was made in January 2023, but the investigation was eventually dropped. Since the allegations surfaced, several of Gaiman's film and TV projects have been affected. Season three of Prime Video's Good Omens will now comprise one 90-minute episode, with Gaiman no longer involved. Disney has paused production on its film adaptation of another Gaiman title, The Graveyard Book, while Netflix has cancelled Dead Boy Detectives, although it's not clear if this was related to the allegations."}

The findings come as negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appear to be nearing a breakthrough. Mediators in Qatar say talks are in their final stages, raising hopes that an agreement could be reached soon. The \"humanitarian zone\" was first established by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in October 2023 toprotect civilians and keep them out of harms way. On 6 May 2024, the IDF significantly expanded the zone to include the cities of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah. The area - much of which is a strip of land along the Mediterranean sea - is densely populated and is estimated to have over a million people living there according to international humanitarian organisations. Many people are living in tents, with limited infrastructure and limited access to aid. Local media reports indicate more than 550 people have been killed in the 97 strikes mapped by BBC Verify. In a statement to BBC Verify, the IDF said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating in the \"humanitarian zone\" and accused the group of violating international law while \"exploiting\" civilians as human shields and launching rockets from the area. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's 7 October 2023 attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. The conflict has caused widespread damage to infrastructure across Gaza, with satellite images showing areas flattened by Israeli strikes. The Hamas-run health ministry also says more than 46,600 people have been killed within the enclave since the start of the war. BBC Verify analysis suggests that attacks within the \"humanitarian zone\" have intensified since May 2024, with at least 22 strikes already recorded so far this month. We also cannot confirm that all incidents are the result of IDF attacks. Locations of strikes documented by BBC Verify were provided to the IDF but they did not confirm or deny their involvement. Israeli military officials have only publicly acknowledged 28 attacks since 6 May. Israel historically has not publicly acknowledged every strike it has carried out in Gaza. Gavin Kelleher, an access manager in Gaza for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said there were \"near daily\" strikes within the zone, including from Israeli ships and quadcopters, or small drones. He added that \"heavy fire is recurrent in this area despite its [Israel's] unilateral 'humanitarian' designation.\" \"The Israeli military appears keen to maintain the illusion of a Humanitarian Zone that remains a certain size, yet that zone can be subject to 'evacuation orders' at any time and be targeted,\" Mr Kelleher said. One resident who lives within the zone, Khaled Abdel Rahman, told the BBC that residents were being subjected to daily bombardments, frequently resulting in injuries and casualties. \"We were displaced to Khan Younis because it was designated as a safe zone, but in fact we find nothing here but insecurity,\" Mr Rahman said."}

Photos of him and stories of people who have met him are incredibly rare. But now a man who got the secretive artist to work with children at a youth club in the late 1990s has given the BBC an exclusive insight into the man behind the murals, just as he was about to become famous. Banksy is one of the world's most famous graffiti artists. His work has sold for millions of pounds and his exhibitions seen by hundreds of thousands of people. But behind layers of paint, lost in time at a Bristol youth club, there's a Banksy very few people know about. On the cusp of international fame, the artist was leaving his mark - not only on the streets of his city, but on young people in Lawrence Weston. Here, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural. \"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building. \"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\" Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous. The artist would return to the club several times to create new works, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds – oblivious to who the artist would eventually become. It was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol. His friend had a suggestion – someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself. That person was Banksy. \"I got his phone number, so I used to call him up and ask if he'd come and do some art projects. He was really keen,\" Peter said. This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police. Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids. The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub. \"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society. \"It was always very vibrant.\" Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \"nobody thought twice about who he was\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston. He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said. \"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego.

Inauguration day includes a formal swearing-in ceremony as well as musical performances, a celebratory parade and a number of formal balls. Vice-President-elect JD Vance will also take the oath of office, joining Trump on stage to officially begin their new administration. The inauguration is the formal ceremony that marks the end of one president's time in office and the start of their successor's administration. It is the most high-profile part of the transition of power between government leaders in Washington DC. A key part of the ceremony includes the president-elect reciting the oath of office: \"I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" Though he won the election in November, Trump officially becomes the 47th president once he says those words. He previously served as the 45th president between 2017 and 2021. Vance will also take an oath of office before he formally assumes the position of vice-president. Trump's second inauguration day will kick off with a service at St. John's Church, Lafayette Square, a historic Washington DC church, followed by tea at the White House. Musical performances and opening remarks are set to begin on the main event stage - located on the West Lawn of the US Capitol building - at 09:30 EST (14:30 GMT). That will be followed by the swearing-in of Trump and Vance as well as the inaugural address in which the president will set out his goals for the next four years. Trump will then head inside to the President's Room - near the Senate chamber - to sign key documents. He will then attend a lunch hosted by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. This is followed by a parade which goes from the Capitol building down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Later in the evening, Trump will appear at three inaugural balls throughout the city - the Commander-in-Chief Ball, the Liberty Inaugural Ball and the Starlight Ball. He is expected to speak at all three. There is typically high demand to watch the inauguration in person, and tickets are highly sought after. Members of Congress receive a certain number of tickets to the ceremony, which they can distribute to their constituents. These tickets are free, but often challenging to get. Americans can contact their congressperson directly for tickets. If you're not able to attend in person, there are plenty of ways to watch remotely. The White House will livestream the inauguration. The BBC will carry inauguration coverage live on our news channel. You can also watch a stream of the inauguration on our website and follow our live page, where we'll bring you updates, analysis and key moments as they happen. Local and federal officials are expecting around 200,000 people to show up in Washington DC, which could include Trump supporters and protestors."}
{"Article Number": 439, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyng762q4eo", "Text": "TikTok will be banned in the US on 19 January - unless the Supreme Court accepts alast ditch legal bid fromits Chinese owner, ByteDance, that to do so would be unconstitutional. But even if the country's highest judicial authority agrees with the lower courts - and Congress - that the platform is a threat to national security will that actually stop Americans using it? Will there be ways to bypass the ban - or could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop a law he says he opposed to, even if the courts uphold it. And whatever happens to TikTok, who stands to benefit from the uncertainty clouding its future? The most likely way the US would ban TikTok is to order app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, to make it unavailable for download in that region. US lawmakers have already told  tech firms to be ready to remove the app from their stores if a ban comes into force. That would mean people could no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok - though it would also mean people who've already got it would still have it on their phones. Because the app would not be publicly available anymore, new updates could no longer be delivered to users in the US - which would make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable. Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target. Of course, there are ways around such a ban. There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region. The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements. It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks. However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app. So if the ban took this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to. There are still other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether. And even if people did use a VPN, there are still ways TikTok could theoretically judge whether a person is based in the US - and then simply present them with a screen saying the app is not available in their country. It remains to be seen whether TikTok would decide to assist the government in its own ban - but it is being reported by Reuters that it plans to do so. TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US unless it rules in its favour."}

This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow whenKabul fell to the Taliban. Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns. Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban government expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\". Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports. How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me. \"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says. Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security. China, for example, has gone far: it has actively engaged with the Taliban government, focusing on security and economic interests, and even hasan ambassadorin the country. No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, but up to 40 countries maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with it. That's why experts like Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, are more circumspect about India's outreach. For the past three years, he says, India has maintained contact with the Taliban through a foreign service diplomat. India had closed its consulates in Afghanistan during the civil war in the 1990s and reopened them in 2002 after the war ended. \"We didn't want this hiatus to develop [again], so we wanted to engage. It is very simply a step up in relations,\" he says. India has\"historical and civilisational ties\" with Afghanistan, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament in 2023.

Photos of him and stories of people who have met him are incredibly rare. But now a man who got the secretive artist to work with children at a youth club in the late 1990s has given the BBC an exclusive insight into the man behind the murals, just as he was about to become famous. Banksy is one of the world's most famous graffiti artists. His work has sold for millions of pounds and his exhibitions seen by hundreds of thousands of people. But behind layers of paint, lost in time at a Bristol youth club, there's a Banksy very few people know about. On the cusp of international fame, the artist was leaving his mark - not only on the streets of his city, but on young people in Lawrence Weston. Here, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural. \"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building. \"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\" Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous. The artist would return to the club several times to create new works, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds – oblivious to who the artist would eventually become. It was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol. His friend had a suggestion – someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself. That person was Banksy. \"I got his phone number, so I used to call him up and ask if he'd come and do some art projects. He was really keen,\" Peter said. This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police. Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids. The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub. \"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society. \"It was always very vibrant.\" Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \"nobody thought twice about who he was\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston. He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said. \"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego. He was doing art with them, rather than doing art for them,\" he said. \"In the morning, he sat around a table with the children, talking about their ideas."}

She had referred herself to the prime minister's standards adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, after questions about links to her aunt, who was ousted last year as Bangladesh's prime minister. Sir Laurie said he had \"not identified evidence of improprieties\" but it was \"regrettable\" that Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of the ties to her aunt. Siddiq said continuing in her role would be \"a distraction\" for the government but insisted she had done nothing wrong. Before her resignation was announced, Siddiq had been named in a second investigation in Bangladesh. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said the prime minister \"dithered and delayed to protect\" her. Writing on X, she said: \"It was clear at the weekend that the anti-corruption minister's position was completely untenable. Yet Keir Starmer dithered and delayed to protect his close friend. \"Even now, as Bangladesh files a criminal case against Tulip Siddiq, he expresses 'sadness' at her inevitable resignation. \"Weak leadership from a weak prime minister.\" In a letter accepting Siddiq's resignation, Sir Keir said the \"door remains open\" for her. Siddiq, whose role as Economic Secretary to the Treasuryincluded tackling corruption in UK financial markets,was named last month in an investigation into claims her family embezzled up to £3.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh. Her aunt is the former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, head of the Awami League, who fled into exile after being deposed last year. Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, also came under intense scrutiny over her use of properties in London linked to her aunt's allies. TheFinancial Times reportedthat one of the properties, a flat in King's Cross, had been given to her by a person connected with the recently ousted Bangladeshi government. According to the Mail on Sunday, in 2022 Siddiq had denied the flat was a gift and insisted her parents had bought it for her and had threatened the paper with legal action preventing publication of a story. Labour sources subsequently told the newspaper the flat had been gifted to Siddiq by a property developer with alleged links to her aunt. Sir Laurie spent eight days investigating the allegations after Siddiq referred herself to the standards watchdog. In his letter, Sir Laurie said Siddiq \"acknowledges that, over an extended period, she was unaware of the origins of her ownership of her flat in Kings Cross, despite having signed a Land Registry transfer form relating to the gift at the time\". He said the MP \"remained under the impression that her parents had given the flat to her, having purchased it from the previous owner\". This had led to the public being \"inadvertently misled\" about the identity of the donor of the flat, added Sir Laurie.

The Canadian startook action last November, alleging that the music companies had used bots, payola and other methods to promote Lamar's song, which accused him of paedophilia. \"The record-shattering spread of Not Like Us on streaming, sales, and radio play was deliberate and appears to have relied upon irregular and inappropriate business practices,\" court documents alleged. However, on Tuesday, Drake's lawyers voluntarily withdrew a pre-action filing, effectively ending the case. According to court documents filed in New York, the star met with representatives of Spotify and Universal on Tuesday to discuss the case. Spotify, which had filed an opposition, had no objection to the withdrawal and discontinuance. Universal, which hadn't filed an opposition, reserved its position. A related case, filed against Universal and radio network iHeartRadio in Texas, is still active.  Not Like Us was widely regarded as the decisive blow in a long-running feud between Drake and Lamar, which dates back to the early 2010s. In the lyrics, Lamar alleges that Drake \"likes 'em young\" and accuses him of using other, more credible rappers, to boost his profile. Around 24 hours later, Drake responded with a track called The Heart Part 6, where he rejected the allegations, saying, \"I never been with no one under age\". He also  claimed to have fed Lamar \"false\" information through a double agent. However, his retort failed to attract the same attention as Not Like Us, which debuted at number one in the US chart and attracted more than 1 billion streams on Spotify. Taking to the courts, Drake accused Universal - which distributes both his music and Lamar's - of artificially boosting the song's numbers. In court documents, he claimed that the label licensed the song \"at drastically reduced rates to Spotify\" and used bots to stream the song, generating \"the false impression that the song was more popular than it was in reality\".  The papers were not a lawsuit, but a \"pre-action petition\", in which Drake's lawyers sought to gain access to internal documents at Spotify and Universal which might have supported their case. In a statement at the time, Universal told the BBC: \"The suggestion that [the company] would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue. \"We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns. No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\" Spotify also responded that there was \"no economic incentive for users to stream Not Like Us over any of Drake's tracks\". The Swedish streaming company later filed an opposition brief to Drake's petition, stating that it \"should be denied\". Music industry experts had been sceptical that the accusations would ever reach trial."}

Some horses came solo, others in trailers packed with fellow animals. Many had their owners, but others arrived alone, brought in by their rescuers or animal control. Pigs, donkeys and miniature horses followed. Within 24 hours, the Los Angeles Equestrian Center had been transformed into a modern-day Noah's Ark. Over the last week, it has sheltered hundreds of animals from the disaster as part of its official role as one of the city's large animal shelters. The facility, tucked in the shadow of Griffith Park, has taken in more than 200 horses, on top of the roughly 500 already living there.  Last Tuesday and Wednesday were \"chaos\", said Jennie Nevin, a spokeswoman for the equestrian centre. The facility catalogued every horse that arrived, making sure they could be reunited. Sheltering the animals came at no cost for the owners, thanks to the support of public donations and frequent drop-offs of free hay, feed and other supplies. Sergio Marcial was one of dozens of people who brought animals here after their own facilities were destroyed or threatened. A week ago, he and his girlfriend Jenny Bacon raced to help rescue more than 70 animals from theEaton Dam Stables while battling flames so intense that his face mask caught fire and his eyeglasses shattered and warped. His efforts landed him in the hospital, his lungs and throat burned after inhaling the torched air. One week later, Mr Marcial, 29, and Ms Bacon, 30, walked Arthur and Playboy - two miniature horses he helped save that night - around their new home. Here, they were safe from the fires, and they seemed calm and friendly despite everything they had endured. \"It still hurts to swallow,\" Mr Marcial said, pointing to a face mask he's required to wear to prevent infections. \"I'd do it all again - no question.\" Most of the sheltered animals' owners have been identified, and several owners spent Tuesday afternoon walking their horses around the stables. Dozens of volunteers cared for the other animals staying at the centre. Some had become local celebrities. Two donkeys, Morris and Mika, frequently poked their heads out of their stables to demand attention. They had fled down the mountain with their owner as the Palisades fire drew near, and were reunited because he had spray-painted his number on to their sides. \"They love for you to sing to them,\" said volunteer Lucena Herrera. \"We've all just been adopting them and taking care of them.\" But a handful of animals still have not been claimed. A miniature horse named Izzy had still not found her owner a week after the fires. The volunteers had collectively adopted her until she could find a new, permanent home.  So many volunteers showed up to help the animals that the staff had to turn some away, Ms Nevin said. Between 50-100 volunteers now raked stalls, fed the animals, fluffed hay and serenaded Morris and Mika when they grew antsy."}

Public Service Cabinet Secretary Justin Muturi said that it took a call by President William Ruto to have his son released by the National Intelligence Service (NIS). Muturi is the first member of the cabinet to publicly criticise the government's handling of the spate of abductions in Kenya. In a statement to the police crime investigations unit on Tuesday, Muturi gave a detailed account of how his son, Leslie, was abducted on 22 June last year. Mr Ruto and the intelligence agency have not commented on his allegations. At least 80 people, including the minister's son, have been abducted in the last six months, according to a state-funded rights group. The wave of abductions started after protests against tax hikes last June, and have continued since then. Some of those abducted have been released following public pressure. Earlier this week, the minister told journalists that he had not received answers about the abduction of his son, despite reaching out to top security officials. Muturi said the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) subsequently urged him to record a statement with them, telling him the matter was still under investigation. In his statement to the DCI, Muturi recalled calling the inspector-general of police, the interior minister, the DCI head, the head of the intelligence agency and other top officials as he desperately looked for his son – but, he added, all were unable to help. He said that he also messaged Ruto, but later decided to visit his official residence to raise the matter directly with him. \"I then narrated the ordeal [to the president] including my interactions with various senior government officials who had been unable to help. I expressed my belief that NIS was holding my son,\" Muturi said in the statement. He said that the president made a joke about the issue and then made a call to the head of the intelligence agency, who promised to release his son in an hour. \"I heard the president ask [NIS director] Noordin Haji if he was holding my son. [He] confirmed that indeed he was holding my son and the president instructed him to release Leslie immediately,\" Muturi added. Muturi has faced calls from some government-allied politicians to resign for publicly criticising the government in which he serves. Foreign nationals have also been abducted, including prominent Tanzanian activist Maria Sarungi Tsehai, who on Monday narrated how she was kidnapped by armed men and released several hours later. Last year, Ugandan opposition leader Kizza Besigye was kidnapped in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, allegedly by Ugandan security officials, and taken across the border for trial by a court martial. Muturi's public mentioning of Ruto's name in connection with abductions is a defiant challenge to the president, and is seen as being against the principle of collective responsibility in government."}

She had referred herself to the prime minister's standards adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, after questions about links to her aunt, who was ousted last year as Bangladesh's prime minister. Sir Laurie said he had \"not identified evidence of improprieties\" but it was \"regrettable\" that Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of the ties to her aunt. Siddiq said continuing in her role would be \"a distraction\" for the government but insisted she had done nothing wrong. Before her resignation was announced, Siddiq had been named in a second investigation in Bangladesh. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said the prime minister \"dithered and delayed to protect\" her. Writing on X, she said: \"It was clear at the weekend that the anti-corruption minister's position was completely untenable. Yet Keir Starmer dithered and delayed to protect his close friend. \"Even now, as Bangladesh files a criminal case against Tulip Siddiq, he expresses 'sadness' at her inevitable resignation. \"Weak leadership from a weak prime minister.\" In a letter accepting Siddiq's resignation, Sir Keir said the \"door remains open\" for her. Siddiq, whose role as Economic Secretary to the Treasuryincluded tackling corruption in UK financial markets,was named last month in an investigation into claims her family embezzled up to £3.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh. Her aunt is the former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, head of the Awami League, who fled into exile after being deposed last year. Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, also came under intense scrutiny over her use of properties in London linked to her aunt's allies. TheFinancial Times reportedthat one of the properties, a flat in King's Cross, had been given to her by a person connected with the recently ousted Bangladeshi government. According to the Mail on Sunday, in 2022 Siddiq had denied the flat was a gift and insisted her parents had bought it for her and had threatened the paper with legal action preventing publication of a story. Labour sources subsequently told the newspaper the flat had been gifted to Siddiq by a property developer with alleged links to her aunt. Sir Laurie spent eight days investigating the allegations after Siddiq referred herself to the standards watchdog. In his letter, Sir Laurie said Siddiq \"acknowledges that, over an extended period, she was unaware of the origins of her ownership of her flat in Kings Cross, despite having signed a Land Registry transfer form relating to the gift at the time\". He said the MP \"remained under the impression that her parents had given the flat to her, having purchased it from the previous owner\". This had led to the public being \"inadvertently misled\" about the identity of the donor of the flat, added Sir Laurie. Sir Laurie said this was an \"unfortunate misunderstanding\" which had led to Siddiq issuing a public correction of \"the origins of her ownership after she became a minister\"."}

Yoon, 64, is being investigated on charges of insurrection for a failed martial law order on 3 December that plunged the country into turmoil. He has also been impeached by parliament and suspended - but will only be removed from office if the Constitutional Court upholds the impeachment. However, Yoon's dramatic arrest on Wednesday brings to an end a weeks-long standoff between investigators and his presidential security team. Investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) failed to arrest him on 3 January after being locked in a six-hour stand-off with his security detail. But just before dawn on Wednesday, a much larger team of investigators and police arrived at his residence in central Seoul, armed with ladders to climb over buses blocking its entrance and bolt cutters to remove barbed wire. Other officers in the arrest team, which numbered around 1,000, scaled walls and hiked up nearby trails to reach the presidential residence. After several hours, authorities announced that Yoon had been arrested. In a three-minute video released just before his arrest, the 64-year-old leader said he would co-operate with the investigators, while repeating previous claims that the warrant was not legally valid. \"I decided to appear before the CIO, even though it is an illegal investigation, in order to prevent any unsavoury bloodshed,\" he said, adding that he witnessed officials \"invade\" his home's security perimeter with fire equipment. On Wednesday afternoon, investigators said Yoon had remained silent throughout questioning. Yoon's lawyers have said his arrest was \"illegal\" because the CIO, as an anti-corruption agency, has no power to investigate the insurrection allegations against Yoon. They also claim the warrant was issued by the wrong jurisdiction. The same court later dismissed an injunction filed by President Yoon to invalidate the arrest warrant, which the authorities maintain is lawful. The opposition Democratic Party's floor leader, Park Chan-dae, said Wednesday's arrest showed that \"justice in South Korea is alive\". This arrest \"is the first step toward restoring constitutional order, democracy and the rule of law\", he said during a party meeting. The country is currently being led by Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok as acting president. He was thrust into power after the first acting president,Han Duck-soo, was also impeachedby parliament, where the opposition has a sizeable majority. The clock has started ticking for investigators. Under the current warrant, they can hold Yoon for up to 48 hours from the point of arrest, after which they need a new warrant to detain him while he continues to be investigated. If that warrant is granted, they can detain him for up to 20 days before he is brought to trial. Without a new warrant, Yoon must be released."}

Winds that have fanned wildfires in the US city of Los Angeles are again expected to kick up on Wednesday - after a 25th death from the huge, week-long outbreak was confirmed. Forecasters have again identified an area of \"extreme fire danger\", emphasising the risk level in a region to the north-west of the city centre. In some mountainous areas, it is possible for winds to reach speeds of 70mph (113km/h), which would be nearly hurricane-force if they are sustained. The anticipated increase in speeds threatens to spread the remaining four blazes, which firefighters have made further progress in tackling during a few days of calmer conditions. Wind speeds began a slow and steady climb on Wednesday morning in parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. They are expected to peak during the day on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Compared with last week's conditions, winds are \"weaker but still strong\", the NWS cautions. There are hopes of another drop over the subsequent days - but officials have highlighted the need for rain that would help fire crews in their battle. \"The anticipated winds combined with low humidities and low fuel moistures will keep the fire threat in the LA region critical,\" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said during a news conference on Tuesday. Areas to the north-west of Los Angeles - including Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks - have been deemed to be particularly dangerous. An improvement in conditions is forecast later on Thursday and into Friday, says BBC Weather forecaster Sarah Keith-Lucas. But no rainfall is forecast for at least the next week - and the Santa Ana winds that have been blamed for stoking the blazes could again develop from Sunday. The fire chief for the city of Pasadena echoed the need for precipitation. There had been no \"real rain in southern California\" for more than 250 days, Chad Augustin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. His firefighters would spent Wednesday on \"standing guard ready to ensure that we hold our containment lines and we don't burn up any more structures\", Mr Augustin added. An extreme weather attribution study from climate scientists at 'Climameter' has concluded that the Californian wildfires have been fuelled by meteorological conditions strengthened by human-induced climate change. The study found that current conditions have been warmer, drier and windier compared with the past, in the areas affected by the fires. The 25th death from the fires was confirmed by the LA County Medical Examiner's Office. Thirteen other people remain missing. Most of the victims have died in the Eaton Fire, which has burned more than 14,000 acres to the city's north, but has now been 35% contained by firefighters. Further west, the larger Palisades Fire has torched more than 23,000 acres, and is now at 18% containment. Two smaller fires also continue to burn. Some of the victims of the Eaton Fire have now been allowed to return to their homes, although officials say they have no firm date for repopulation of the Palisades area, an upmarket area ravaged by the fire to which it lent its name."}

This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow whenKabul fell to the Taliban. Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns. Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban government expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\". Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports. How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me. \"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says. Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security. China, for example, has gone far: it has actively engaged with the Taliban government, focusing on security and economic interests, and even hasan ambassadorin the country. No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, but up to 40 countries maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with it. That's why experts like Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, are more circumspect about India's outreach. For the past three years, he says, India has maintained contact with the Taliban through a foreign service diplomat. India had closed its consulates in Afghanistan during the civil war in the 1990s and reopened them in 2002 after the war ended. \"We didn't want this hiatus to develop [again], so we wanted to engage. It is very simply a step up in relations,\" he says. India has\"historical and civilisational ties\" with Afghanistan, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament in 2023. India has invested more than $3bn (£2.46bn) in over 500 projects across Afghanistan, including roads, power lines, dams, hospitals and clinics. It has trained Afghan officers, awarded thousands of scholarships to students and built a new parliament building. This reflects a lasting geopolitical reality."}

The term \"clinical obesity\" should be used for patients with a medical condition caused by their weight, while \"pre-clinically obese\" should be applied to those remaining fat but fit, although at risk of disease. This is better for patients than relying only on body mass index (BMI) - which measures whether they are a healthy weight for their height - to determine obesity. More than a billion people are estimated to beliving with obesity worldwideand prescription weight-loss drugs are in high demand. The report, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, is supported by more than 50 medical experts around the world.  \"Some individuals with obesity can maintain normal organ function and overall health, even long term, whereas others display signs and symptoms of severe illness here and now,\" Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, who chaired the expert group, said. \"Obesity is a spectrum,\" he added. The current, blanket definition means too many people are being diagnosed as obese but not receiving the most appropriate care, the report says. Natalie, from Crewe, goes to the gym four times a week and has a healthy diet, but is still overweight. \"I would consider myself on the larger side, but I'm fit,\" she told the BBC 5 Live phone-in with Nicky Campbell. \"If you look at my BMI I'm obese, but if I speak to my doctor they say that I'm fit, healthy and there's nothing wrong with me. \"I'm doing everything I can to stay fit and have a long healthy life,\" she said. Richard, from Falmouth, said there is a lot of confusion around BMI. \"When they did my test, it took me to a level of borderline obesity, but my body fat was only 4.9% - the problem is I had a lot of muscle mass,\" he says. In Mike's opinion, you cannot be fat and fit - he says it is all down to diet. \"All these skinny jabs make me laugh, if you want to lose weight stop eating - it's easy.\" Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as havinga BMI over 30- a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight. It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared. For example, if they are 70kg (about 11 stone) and 1.70m (about 5ft 7in): Find out what your body mass index (BMI) means on the NHS website But BMI has limitations. It measures whether someone is carrying too much weight - but not too much fat. So very muscular people, such as athletes, tend to have a high BMI but not much fat. The report says BMI is useful on a large scale, to work out the proportion of a population who are a healthy weight, overweight or obese. But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs. Measuring a patient's waist or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says."}

There were reports of a breakthrough on Wednesday, with unnamed Israeli officials cited as saying that Hamas had agreed to the latest draft presented by Qatari, US and Egyptian mediators. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office however swiftly denied the reports. There was also no immediate comment from the Palestinian armed group. On Tuesday night, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said they were \"on the brink\" of an agreement and awaiting \"final word from Hamas\". A senior Hamas official later told Reuters news agency it had not delivered its official response to the draft because Israel had yet to submit maps showing how its troops would withdraw from areas of Gaza. However, Israel's Haaretz newspaper cited an Israeli source as denying Hamas's claim about the maps. The proposed three-phase deal would begin with an initial six-week ceasefire. A Palestinian official told the BBC that Hamas would release three hostages on the first day of a deal, after which Israel would begin withdrawing troops from populated areas. More hostage releases would then be staggered over the following weeks, he said, with Israel allowing displaced residents to return in northern areas. Israel has said it expects 33 hostages to be released in the first phase and that it will free a yet to be determined number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails in return. Negotiations for the second phase - which should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli troop withdrawal and a \"sustainable calm\" - would start after two weeks. Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman said on Tuesday that there were no major issues were blocking a deal and that he was hopeful the talks would \"very soon lead to an agreement\". However, he also warned that that \"the most minor detail\" could yet undermine the process. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 46,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of the 2.3 million population has also been displaced, there is widespread destruction, and there are severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter due to an struggle to get aid to those in need. Israel says 94 of the hostages are still being held by Hamas, of whom 34 are presumed dead. In addition, there are four Israelis who were abducted before the war, two of whom are dead. Relatives of the remaining hostages have urged the Israeli government to do whatever it takes to get a deal over the line and bring all of them home. \"We can't miss this moment. This is the last moment; we can save them,\" said Hadas Kalderon, the wife of Ofer Kalderon, a 54-year-old. Palestinians also dared to hope that an end to the devastating 15-month war was close."}

The changes, which are set to come into force from 27 January, are a U-turn from a policy introduced six years ago that allowed people to linger in Starbucks outlets and use their toilets without making a purchase. The move is part of the \"back to Starbucks\" strategy - a plan announced by the firm's new boss as he tries to tackle flagging sales. Starbucks said there was no change to its policy in the UK, where customers can continue to use the facilities without purchasing anything. The world's biggest coffee chain says its new code of conduct - which also addresses harassment and bans smoking and outside alcohol - aims to make its stores more welcoming. \"Implementing a Coffeehouse Code of Conduct... is a practical step that helps us prioritise our paying customers who want to sit and enjoy our cafes,\" a Starbucks spokesperson told BBC News. \"These updates are part of a broader set of changes we are making to enhance the cafe experience as we work to get back to Starbucks.\" The company said the new rules would be displayed at every store and staff would be instructed to ask anyone who violates the code of conduct to leave. That includes allowing employees to call the police when necessary. The change ends a policy Starbucks introduced in 2018 after two black men were arrested at one of the company's stores in Philadelphia. The men, one of whom had asked to use the toilet, had said they were waiting for a friend and refused a manager's request to leave. The video of the incident went viral, and critics accused the chain of racial profiling and called for a boycott. Starbucks apologised to the men, agreed a settlement, and to help counter the backlash announced it would welcome people into their cafes, whether or not they were customers. Starbucks has been trying to boost flagging sales as it grappled with a backlash to price increases and boycotts sparked by the Israel-Gaza war. Brian Niccol, who previously headed the Mexican food chain Chipotle, wasbrought into Starbucks last yearto help turn the business around. Mr Niccol has been trying to improve the customer experience at Starbucks' cafes byrevamping its menusand coffee shops.

Firefighters made progress over the weekend in containing the Palisades and Eaton fires but warn that the return of high winds - forecast until Wednesday - could see these two spread again, or fuel new ones. The fires are already among the most destructive in LA's history when measured by the number of buildings destroyed. Rebuilding work will cost \"tens of billions\" of dollars, US President Joe Biden has said. An area to the north-west of the city centre is described by officials as \"particularly dangerous\". A red flag warning - indicating a high level of fire danger - is in place until 18:00 (02:00 GMT) on Wednesday, with the strongest Santa Ana winds expected on Tuesday. Nearby, the largest fire is in the Palisades area, and has burnt through more than 23,000 acres. It is still only about 14% contained, despite the efforts of thousands of firefighters. The blaze is moving east, threatening the exclusive neighbourhood of Brentwood, home to the Getty Center, a world-famous art museum that has evacuated its staff. Another fire, Eaton, is more deadly than Palisades so far - responsible for 16 of the deaths. The overall destruction is immense, with more than 12,000 structures - homes, outbuildings, sheds, mobile homes and cars - destroyed. Celebrities Mel Gibson and Paris Hilton are among those who have lost their homes. Tens of thousands of homes are also without power. The fires could turn out to be the costliest in US history, with damage projected at up to $150bn, according to a preliminary estimate by AccuWeather. There are three active fires in the wider area, while a smaller fire is nearly contained, say California fire officials: The earlier Kenneth, Archer, Sunset, Lidia, Woodley and Olivasfires have been contained. Containment describes the progress firefighters make in controlling the spread of flames. It is often listed as a percentage. For example, if a fire is 14% contained, that means fire crews have established barriers around 14% of the fire's perimeter. Natural barriers include roads, rivers and oceans. Firefighters can also create barriers using equipment such as bulldozers, hoses and shovels to remove vegetation down to the bare soil, meaning there is nothing for the fire to burn. A fire being 100% contained doesn't mean it has been extinguished, but rather that the flames have been fully encircled and the spread has been effectively stopped. Detectives continue to investigate the possible causes. Lightning - the most common source of fires in the US - has been ruled out as a cause for the Palisades and Eaton fires. There has been no official indication so far that arson or utility lines - the next two biggest culprits in sparking fires - caused any of the conflagrations. However, in the case of the Eaton fire, legal cases have been filed against the electrical company, Southern California Edison Company (SCE), claiming there is evidence that the blaze - one of the largest - was ignited due to negligence of the firm's overhead wires."}
{"Article Number": 462, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg45l9q62w4o", "Text": "Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's pick for defence secretary in his upcoming presidency, cleared his first hurdle on the way to confirmation: a long - and at times tense - hearing before the US Senate's Armed Services Committee. For more than four hours on Tuesday, Hegseth faced questions about his ability to run the defence department, including its three million employees and $849bn (£695bn) budget. And although he was grilled by Democrats overaccusations of sexual assault, infidelity and drinking in the workplace, he appears all but certain to be confirmed to the role after no Republicans came out against him. This was underscored later on Tuesday when Joni Ernst, one Republican who had been seen as a potential roadblock to his nomination, said she would support him. Here's a look at the five main takeaways from Hegseth's testimony. From the very start of his testimony,Hegseth, a military veteran,emphasised what he called a \"warrior culture\", vowing to return the focus of the defence department to the strength of America's military. \"Warfighting, lethality, meritocracy, standards, and readiness. That's it. That is my job,\" he said in his opening statements. As the hearing continued, Hegseth was critical of policies he felt harmed the efficiency and \"lethality\" of the military, namely efforts aimed at racial and gender diversity. \"This is not a time for equity,\" he said, adding that he opposes quotas, which he claims hurt morale. In what became an expectedly partisan hearing, Democrats repeatedly grilled Hegseth on his past statements suggesting women were not suited to serve in combat roles in the military. Questions along these lines from Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Mazie Hirono and Elizabeth Warren provided some of the most heated moments of the morning. He spoke over Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, as she tried to point to comments about female service members stretching back years. \"Mr Hegseth, I'm quoting you in a podcast: 'Women shouldn't be in combat at all',\" Warren said. Hegseth remained composed, responding by saying his concern was not women in combat, but simply maintaining \"standards\" in the military. Hegseth, who at 44 would be the youngest defence secretary in decades, also answered questions about his preparedness to run the defence department, a sprawling agency. The former Fox News host described himself as a \"change agent\", saying \"it's time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm.\" Some Republicans deemed Hegseth's lack of experience a strength. \"I just want to say for all the talk of experience and not coming from the same cocktail parties that permanent Washington is used to, you are a breath of fresh air,\" Senator Eric Schmitt, a Republican from Missouri, said. A graduate of Princeton and Harvard universities, Hegseth was an infantry platoon leader in Guantanamo Bay and Iraq, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. Hegseth, also a former Fox News TV host, has military experience in Afghanistan as well. Still, Democrats pressed Hegseth on his qualifications for the top military job."}
{"Article Number": 463, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyng762q4eo", "Text": "TikTok will be banned in the US on 19 January - unless the Supreme Court accepts alast ditch legal bid fromits Chinese owner, ByteDance, that to do so would be unconstitutional. But even if the country's highest judicial authority agrees with the lower courts - and Congress - that the platform is a threat to national security will that actually stop Americans using it? Will there be ways to bypass the ban - or could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop a law he says he opposed to, even if the courts uphold it. And whatever happens to TikTok, who stands to benefit from the uncertainty clouding its future? The most likely way the US would ban TikTok is to order app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, to make it unavailable for download in that region. US lawmakers have already told  tech firms to be ready to remove the app from their stores if a ban comes into force. That would mean people could no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok - though it would also mean people who've already got it would still have it on their phones. Because the app would not be publicly available anymore, new updates could no longer be delivered to users in the US - which would make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable. Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target. Of course, there are ways around such a ban. There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region. The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements. It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks. However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app. So if the ban took this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to. There are still other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether. And even if people did use a VPN, there are still ways TikTok could theoretically judge whether a person is based in the US - and then simply present them with a screen saying the app is not available in their country. It remains to be seen whether TikTok would decide to assist the government in its own ban - but it is being reported by Reuters that it plans to do so. TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US unless it rules in its favour."}
{"Article Number": 464, "Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yv4p95m6vo", "Text": "Tears, dismayed cries and shocked faces: that was the reaction among the supporters of South Korea's suspended president Yoon Suk Yeol outside his home on hearing that he had been arrested. It was amoment that had been in the making for weeks- ever since the last attempt to arrest Yoon on 3 January had failed after adramatic standoff. Yet, when the news of his arrest on came on Wednesday morning, it only seemed to create more uncertainty – and highlight the divide in a country that has already been deeply polarised by Yoon's short-lived martial law order and impeachment by parliament. \"This country is in crisis,\" said one pro-Yoon woman, tears streaming down her face. \"I've been praying since last night for a stable and peaceful South Korea.\" It's what both sides say they want but they cannot agree on how to get there. For the past month, a defiant 64-year-old Yoon was holed up inside his presidential compound in central Seoul, as his supporters and detractors rallied outside. They had turned Yongsan in central Seoul into an epicentre of protest, with tensions often running high. Hundreds of them had camped out overnight on Tuesday, as the arrest appeared imminent, in temperatures that plummeted to -8C. The only thing they shared was the food trucks keeping them warm with steaming drinks and instant noodles. Yoon's supporters jostled with the police officers - numbering 3,000 – who assembled to take him into custody. \"Don't call us stupid far-rights,\" one protester shouted, reflecting the frustration in the Yoon camp. A starkly different scene unfolded on the other side of the street. Opponents of Yoon, who had long called for his arrest, celebrated with chants and cheers. Their jubilation only made the pro-Yoon camp angrier, with some yelling: \"Don't taunt us - this is not funny.\" The gulf is not restricted to this corner of Yongsan. It has loomed over the whole country for more than a month. Yoon's shock announcement of martial law on 3 December almost instantly divided public opinion into two camps. While some believed his claims the country was under threat, a larger group viewed the move as an opportunistic abuse of power. This sentiment was reflected even within Yoon's own party, as several of its lawmakers voted to impeach him. The growing opposition to Yoon's actions has cast a pall over the nation. The year-end season in South Korea is usually vibrant. But this year has been noticeably different. The political turmoil – along with thedevastating Jeju Air crashon 29 December – has created a subdued and sombre atmosphere. Yoon himself had largely avoided the public since he was impeached by parliament in mid-December. He never stepped out of his residence to meet his supporters. On New Year's Day, he sent them a note, saying he was \"closely watching [them] via a YouTube livestream\". He skipped the first hearing of his impeachment trial on 14 January, delaying the proceedings. Before that he had refused to comply with multiple summonses as part of the criminal investigation on insurrection charges, which led to the arrest warrant."}
