{"headline":"Togo national football team attack: Survivors remember machine gun ambush, 10 years afta","text":"On 8 January 2010, di Africa Cup of Nations for Angola bin only remain few days before e start. I bin dey di province of Cabinda, dey prepare to cover Group B for di BBC World Service, and bin also dey in charge of handing ova di BBC African Footballer of the Year trophy to di newly-crowned winner, Ivory Coast captain Didier Drogba. As di day waka dey go, unconfam reports of shooting, wey involve Togo national team, start to fly evriwia. Di detail bin no clear, but e clear say sometin serious don happun. How serious di tin be show wen I meet di squad as dem dey return to dia hotel for Cabinda city. I ask to speak to someone, dem immediately tell me say di team tok-tok pesin na dia best-known player - wey be Manchester City star Emmanuel Adebayor. Wen e siddon to tok, e give shocking details of di attack wey kill two members of di Togo delegation and result in life changing injuries to some odas. 10 years afta, dis na di tori from team members wey make global headlines and wetin happun afta. Togo squad bin dey in good spirits days before di 2010 Nations Cup. Dem just qualify back for di tournament afta dem miss out for 2008 and bin dey prepare to take on group wey feature some of di biggest names for African football - Drogba Ivory Coast and Michael Essien Ghana bin dey di same group.  Before di tournament, Togo decide to camp for Pointe Noir for Republic of Congo, just over 100km from wia dem go play dia group games for Angola city of Cabinda.  Cabinda dey separate from di rest of Angola, and instead of di Togo suad to fly from wia dem dey to di capital Luanda and den fly back north again, dem choose to drive. Dis decision later end with bad result. Afta di suqad relax in di evening, di night before - dem travel go di border. Players bin just dey laugh and joking amongst demselves for di bus. Angola security forces join dem for di border and suppose escort dem through di forest - wey be di base of one groups wey dey call for independence from Angola - to Cabinda city. Di squad no pay much attention to dia arrival.  Dem no know say very soon dem go begin fight for di lives of everyone inside di Togo team bus. Di small convoy move from di border, to di road through di forest. Looking back 10 years, midfielder Junior Senaya recall di journey, and di moment everitin change.  \"All of us bin dey enjoy, afta we don cross di border. Some of us bin dey busy dey listen to music. I remember afta 15 minutes wey we don dey drive we hear gunshot for di forest - we all laugh, make joke. Den serious shooting start.\" Di first casualty happen before anybody even know wetin dey go on. Senaya remember Togo media officer, Stanislas Ocloo, bin stand to video dia arrival for Angola at di moment of di attack. Dem shoot kill am. Anoda player wey remember clearly those crazy moments na goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale. Im life change for just few seconds, as e realise say dem don shoot am too.  \"I hear di sound of di machine gun,\" Im tok, \"and for dat very moment I bin want move go hide, e bin dey as if dem nail me to chair. \"Dat na wen I see myself - both my belle and my back begin bleed. Dat na wen I begin panic. I say: 'Dem don hit me, help me, help me, I want see my daughter, my son. I no wan die here.'\" Even as im dey handle e own injuries, and fear, Obilale bin dey able to remember and tok wetin happun dat day. Im remember as assistant coach Amelete Abalo shout say dem don shoot am - di 54-year-na one of di pipo wey die for di attack. E remember one team-mate wey get military training call for weapon, so dat e go fit fight back. Di team bin no dey able to escape from di shooting because di bus driver - Mario Adjoua - don also wunjure for di start of di attack. Di convoy by-force stop, and serious firefight brake out between di attackers and di security forces. Memories of how long e last dey different, but everyone agree say na at least 30 minutes e last.  Adebayor tok about how serious di longest half hour of e life dey. \"No be like say one or two guys shoot one or two times on our bus,\" Adebayor tell me afta im don dey safe place for di team hotel few hours afta di attack. \"We don dey di middle of dat for 30 minutes or even more. Our bus bin don stop and pipo bin don dey shoot our bus for 30 minutes. Can you imagine? Honestly na one of di worst experiences I don eva get for my life. \"Without di security den I no go dey here dey tok you. Maybe na my dead body you fit dey tok to.\"  Accounts of how e all end different - Adebayor describe one fleet of 4x4 vehicles arrive to take di squad away even as dem still dey shoot from di forest, while Senaya remember silence. But eventually dem take all of dem to hospital for di outskirts of Cabinda City, wia those wey noting do help carry dia dead and colleagues wey wunjure inside. \"Those na di times wey you realise wetin dey happun really, wen I take one of di players inside di hospital,\" Adebayor tok. \"Wen I come out, I see all di players, and everyone bin dey cry, everyone bin dey tok about dia family, calling pipo, calling dia mama, dey cry for phone. \"I think dat na di worst moment of dis day, because you fit see pipo tell dia last words, because dem think say dem go die.\" Shortly afta dat di squad security men leave di squad on dia own wit few local officials.  Wit dead and injured friends and colleagues for hospital, dem later walk short distance to dia hotel compound, without any security whatsoever. Dat na wia I come across dem, and I walk wit di team as dem waka go back dia accommodation. All four teams for di group bin dey stay for di same compound and Kolo Toure and couple of oda Ivorians come to offer condolences and find out wetin happen - rumours bin done already spread. Di survivors den sidon to eat - e bin dey late for evening, by dis point dem neva chop anytin since. Throughout di meal, evriwia bin dey silent. Di news of di attack make global headlines, and wia 24 hours earlier I bin dey able to walk in simply wit tournament accreditation, di next day heavy paramilitary security surround di hotel complex.  Officials, goment ministers and representatives of di Confederation of African Football fly in from Angola capital Luanda, wit questions about wetin happen, who dey responsible, and why - for sometin wey go against tournament rules - Togo decide to drive instead of fly. Shortly afta di attack claim of responsibility comot from di Front for di Liberation of di Enclave of Cabinda, wey be separatist group wey never don accept di decision of di former colonial power, Portugal, to integrate Cabinda into Angola in di late 1950s. Several factions of di body bin dey, and which one dey responsible no dey clear - but e clear from very early on say dis no be attempted robbery. Anoda question lie for di presence Angolan security wey travel with di team. If Togo no dey authorised to drive to Cabinda, why and how come dem even get escort? And na di militarised escort cause di attack? None of dis questions get clear answers, even 10 years on - and at di time di most immediate issue for di players na to absorb wetin don happen to dem and decide wetin to do next. For several days e no dey clear to those of us wey watch from di outside wetin go happen. Rumours suggest say split bin dey between those for camp wey want continue wit di tournament and those wey want go home. In di end, Togolese authorities for Lome take decision, dem call di squad home to attend di funeral of those wey die and take part in ceremonies of national mourning - decision wey later make Caf ban dem sake of alleged \"government interference\" for football. Few days afta dia terrifying experience, Togo Sparrowhawks come out of dia hotel complex for anoda heavily armed convoy, dis time dem head towards Cabinda airport, and later leave. But di consequences of wetin happen no go easily leave di mind of those wey involve for di assault.  Two pipo bin die and a number of odas seriously wound - di worst na di goalkeeper, Obilale. Initially tori spread say im die too. Dat no dey true, but e suffer serious damage to im spine, intestines, liver and bladder, and dem transfer am go hospital for South Africa, to begin e recovery. Since den e don face eight major operations and don get to rebuild e life, physically and emotionally. \"I done do lot of tins, and I happy say I do dem. I go back to school, take exams, work and write book,\" im tok. For long time im work wit children with special needs, as e help dem through di medium of football, and e don set up e own organisation to continue dat work. Obilale lose e livelihood - and almost e life - for Cabinda and e dey striking say im tok say na since only di change in leadership for di Confederation of African Football for 2017, wen current president Ahmad comot Issa Hayatou, na im e don get any meaningful contact wit di continental governing body. On Tuesday night Caf give am special award, 10 years from Cabinda, to recognise e achievement for im recovery, and wetin e dey do to help odas. Cameroon legend Samuel Eto'o na di host for Hurghada, and e be one of several former players wey don provide steady support. Odas na e former captain Adebayor and Ghana Ayew brothers - Andre Ayew and e brother Rahim bin dey part of di Black Stars squad wey play for Cabinda for 2010. Even those wey e no affect physically face significant challenges for di wake of di attack. Junior Senaya, wey be player wey help take Togo to dia remarkable first World Cup for Germany for 2006, bin dey only 25 wen e happen, but e football career end dat day. \"E bin dey psychologically catastrophic, e turn [tins] upside down,\" na so im tok. \"I really no fit recover... I find no reason at all to play football for my club because psychologically I bin dey shocked.\" Now im dey study for e coaching badges. E last for half an hour, maybe a little more. Why and how e happen na still di subject of some dispute. But no one fit deny di human cost of dat short bus trip for Cabinda, 10 years ago.

Ikechukwu na 200 Level student of University of Benin wia im dey study International Studies and Diplomacy. For ceremony wey happun for Lagos, Nigeria wia BBC Pidgin announce am as winner, im read di essay wey see am beat oda pipo wey submit dia entries.  Ikechukwu title im winning essay 'Africa dey ready for female political leadership.' According to Ikechukwu, di essay wey im write na \"to support equality.\" \"I dey happy to win di competition becos wen I bin write dis esaay I bin no dey feel fine,\" na so Ikechukwu tok Dis na di second time BBC News Pidgin dey arrange dis essay competition wey dem wan continue to dey do evri year. \"Africa dey ready for female political leadership.\" Leadaship wahala na wetin wey dey chop Africa kontinent as food.Africa na wan of di seven kontinent wey dey di world wey get rich cultures, resources and different pipo (ethnics) but afta e kontries get independence from di hands of di oyibo wey be rule ha afta di scramble of Africa (1884\/85), leadaship wahala don make e kontries kneel down. Sabi Pipo for political economy sey na di slave trade and colonaizeshon na e mek Africa no dey laik e mate, but di problem of Africa wey mek am no dey laik oda kontinent na poor leadership and ojoro wey dey rain foh Africa. Since oyibo kontries begin dey knack African kontries independence well well wey first start wit Liberia (1847). Since den, na onli few women don rule Africa.Naturally , pipo be dey see women as weaka genda wey go end in Kitchen bekos of dis , women kom be pipo wey dem leave foh back wen e kom foh politics mata.But several women don raiz to challenge di press press wey men be dey press dem. Di hai success wey women get foh leadaship in di world and Africa don mek Africans ready.Even Muslim kontries wey e dey dey hard foh woman to smell pawa don dey sopot dem well well.Di reason wey mek dem ready na bekos of doz wey don rule and literacy wey don hai foh Africa.Literacy don mek Africans see men leadership as scam and di raiz of Feminism follo helep dey ginga equality foh everi kona of life and anoda tin wey mek dem ready na di beta record foh leadaship wey di Few female formal African president get . From meni tins wey women dey do foh Africa and how Africans tek dey back dem up , no need again to doubt sey \"Africans dey ready foh Female political leadership\" . In taims of world politics meni women from Africa get mouth , pipo laik Amina J Mohammed wey be Deputy Secretary General foh United Nations, , Ameenah Fakim wey be wan taim Mauritius president, Elisabeth Dominiten wey be first female prime minister foh Africa and Alhan Olmar wey dey play weight foh world politics, di success and change wey dem bring mek pipo dey change how dem be dey see women befoh. Meni kontries don dey clear road foh women leadership, kontries wey dey laik Tanzania get special seats foh women foh dia Parliament , no bodi dey drag am from dem .Dis kain tin dey ginga women to join gofment , wit dis we go know sey some African kontries don lay foundation or ready foh female leadership. Foh som Muslim kontries befoh , women no too dey politics bet di raiz of Alaa Salah of Sudan wey lead di Sudan protest go show pesin how pipo dey ready to trowey di old believe sey woman no fit rule. If pesin chook eye foh wetin wey happun foh Sudan dis year , di pesin go know sey na woman na e lead di protest wey commot di long taim tyrant Sudan presido and meni Sudanese sopot am wich means dia need a rula who dey ready to rule even if na woman.Wetin wey go dey boda pipo na mek di pawa no kom dey wan sai-d again bekos by eye chook , pesin go see wetin wey dey happun foh Algieria wia 70 % income earnas na women , di majority lawyas na dem , though dem neva di rule but dis go show pipo di sopot dem dey get and di weight dem dey kari. Di most prominent African pesins today na women, wich go tell us more about dey kain ogbonge spirit wey dem get and na dat dia ogbonge spirit na e mek Africans wan welcome dem. women sabi cool down more dan men , dis go mek dem sofri dey handle palava wey dem get insai-d and awsai-d dia kontries.Africa wey dey face migration , Ojoro and poverty, kari eye dey fain who go mek doz tins kpai witout lookin at uche face.Dem dey ready to vote di pesin weda na female or enitin, so fa di pesin go bring change kom. African women rait from histori don get lioness spirit Wey mek dem rule dia kingdom in dey odin days wen oyibo neva kom Africa.Befoh di colonaizeshon of Africa, Africa don already get pawaful women wey sabi rule, if todays African women fit rule laik doz women \"African histori go change\" .Pipo laik Queen Amina wey rule Hausa pipo, Queen Cleopatra of classical antiquity Egypt , mulatto solitude of Ashanti kingdom and Queen Sheba of Axum , dis women get pawa foh dia taim wey mek dem rule dia kingdom. So , African women rait from taim don sabi rule but di komin of Oyibo pipo kom stop all dis tins, kom kari pawa put am foh men hands and dem kom dey abuse am. Since African kontries begin dey get independence wey start from Liberia (1847), and Ethiopia wey dem no colonaiz, Men be di rule .Di poor performance of di men leadaship na e mek Africa undadevelop, na e mek ha economy down , poverty,high death rate , low per capita and hai illiteracy all dis na wetin e cause.Di Men leadas dey thief dia kontries moni kari am go keep foh oyibo kontries instead dem go use am develop dia own kontri. Dis ojoro palava na e men use underdevelop Africa.Foh a kontri to develop e go get stable politics and economy wich African leadas no gree give dia citizens since independence wey dem begin to knack African kontries well well since 1960. Since di male politicians no gree do good , meni women don kom to teach dem how to do am and Africans don taya to dey criticise dia male politician wey las las go be laik tree wey no get fruit.Di main reason wey mek Africans popori finish dey wait foh who go kari dem along na di poverti wey men politicians kos , di thief thief , human rait abuse and oda women wey don rule Africa and di won wey dey rule oyibo wey do somtin foh dia pipo , all dis mek Africans dey ready to wekom Women . Di raiz of feminism and equality and di cry of Africans foh betament don clear road foh di komin of meni pawaful women wey dem taste and believe sey dem good. Equality na wetin dey rain foh di world and e don enta Africa, and as a continent wey won bury poverty and Ojoro e go mek sense mek everibodi dey equal in evritin no mata di pesin genda , na dis fit helep di kata kata wey dey wahala pipo upandan foh Africa. E no dey fashonable again to sey women na kitchen dem dey end bekos from di wans wey we don taste , five stars na e dem collect.Africa don grow finish so women fit rule and since Africa begin dey grab independence well well na onli few women don rule but meni don hold wan or two post foh dia different kontries wich dem do well.Pipo laik Ellen sirleaf wey bring peace to Liberia and Ngozi Okonji Iweala wey mek Nigeria di best economy foh Africa and fastest growing economy in di world foh her taim go tell us how e go be if women get chance to siddon foh di presido sit. To jos chook eye pesin go know sey di kontries wey women be don rule no get kata kata again or hungry wey be dey knack dem upandan don dey fain wey, dis tins mek Africans dey ready to sopot women leadership. If pesin chook eye foh wetin wey happun foh Suddan di pesin go rememba sey na woman wey lead di pipo wey commot dia tyrant leader no be onli dat , Mauritus na wan of di best kontri in Africa since Ameenah Gurik Fakim start to dey rule am.She kuku clear ojoro befoh she commot and mek her kontri wan of di best, from dis we go know sey Africa don ready to elect women bekos no pesin go see road and won waka enta bush. Africans know sey e no dey fashonable again to sey women no fit rule na e mek dem dey sopot women upandan.Plenti women neva rule African kontries bet di few wans wey don rule beta pass dia men counterpart. Africans see women to be more economaizin and less koropt and na from di little wans wey don rule na e dem tek know.Africans no go eva tok mek dem no menshon Ellen Sirleaf wey bring peace foh Liberia , Ameenah Fakim of Mauritius , Amina J mohammed wey be Deputy Secretary General of United Nations (UN) and Ngozi Okonji Iweala of Nigeria , all dis women helep dia kontries in wan way or di oda.Since di male leaders no gree solve di kata kata wey dey wahala Africa , dis women kuku do di tin wey dem no fit do. Africans dey see wetin wey dey happun foh oda oyibo kontries wey som don rule dem, dem dey see how Angel Merkel dey transform Germany and na woman she be and di ojoro wey awa male politicians don do foh meni years , all dis tins don mek dem ready for female leadership.","category":"nigeria","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/pidgin\/tori-50334497"}

{"headline":"Homosexuality decriminalization and LGBT Rights in Africa - See di African nations wey get legalization testament alias accept homosexual practices as nature of sexual orientation but not immorality","text":"Homosexuality decriminalization don turn global movement for di legalization alias give go ahead or freedom to pipo wey by nature dey attracted to di own sex AKA same sex relationship. But inside Africa no be all kontris dey accept homosexual meaning, as dis type of sexual orientation fit attract 'more than 10 years in prison penalty'. in some parts of di continent. However di West African nation of Gabon fit join di list of up to 22 African kontris wey don vote to decriminalise homosexuality inside di continent wey get 53 kontris, wetin remain na for di president to sign di bill into law. Gabon senate just recently vote strongly in favour of decriminalising homosexuality, one week afta di lower house for di national assembly vote for a similar change. Homosexual practices na sexual practices wey include: Gay, Lesbian sexual practices. But plenti prominent politicians, and even Christian wey dey argument ontop wetin bible tok about homosexuals and Muslim leaders for Gabon, don vex for di decision, dem describe am as change to appease di foreign donors. Gabon no be di first African kontri to dey consider say homosexuality no be crime. Some oda kontris wey don decriminalise homosexuality for Africa na: South Africa na di first nation for di continent to decriminalize homosexuality for 1998, wen di Johannesburg High Court rule say di kontri sodomy law no follow di new adopted post-apartheid Constitution. In fact na di first kontri for di world to protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation and di fifth to legalize same-sex marriage. Since 2010, many Southern Africa kontris don decriminalise same-sex relations,  For 2015, Mozambique revised di penal code wey say homosexuality na offence. For di revised code, dem drop one colonial-era clause wey dey outlaw \"vices against nature\". Di new law mean say authorities no go punish anybody wey dey engage in homosexual relationship. For one landmark decision for campaigners, High Court rule in favour of decriminalising homosexuality for June 2019,  Di court reject laws wey impose up to seven years for prison for same-sex relationships, dem tok say e no follow constitution. Law wey dey forbid homosexual relationship for Botswana don dey in place since 1965 wen di colonial British goment dey rule di kontri. Na one student challenge di case for court wen she tok say society don change and pipo don dey accept homosexuality. In May 2016, fourteen lawmakers vote for Seychelles parliament vote to favour di proposal wey seek to amend di Section 151 of di kontri Penal Code wey tok say sodomy na felony and anybodi wey dem gbab go spend 14 years for prison Di amendment dey come three months afta President James Michel tok for one national address say im goment go introduce new bill to abolish Section 151 of di kontri constitution.  He tok say di law na colonial remnant and na dem no welcome am for dia society . Im also remind di nation of Seychelles's 2011 agreement wit di UN Humans Rights Council to decriminalize homosexuality. Though religious leaders bin no like di decision, dem tok say di law no follow di beliefs of plenti catholics for di kontri. Angola rule against di \"vices against nature\" provision for im law for 2019. Di kontri even take one step further to stop discrimination against pipo on di basis of dia sexual orientation. E mean say, anybody wey no gree employ or provide services to individual sake of dia sexual orientation fit face up to two years for prison. Di changes happun on January 23 as Angola parliament adopt im first new penal code since dem gain independence from Portugal in 1975 and remove di provision wey dem inherit from dia Portuguese colonizers. Same-sex sexual acts between men and between women don always dey legal for Burkina Faso. Though di Constitution of Burkina Faso no authorize same-sex marriage, dem define marriage as union between one man and one woman. Homosexuality don always dey legal for Ivory Coast sake of say some parts of di kontri na former French colony and dem inherit sodomy laws from France like oda British colonies. But, same-sex couples and households no dey eligible for di same legal protections wey dey available to opposite-sex couples for di kontri. Same-sex sexual activity among persons wey be at least 21 years of age dey legal for Madagascar.  Di Penal Code provides for prison sentence of two to five years and a fine of 2 to 10 million ariary (US$900 to US$4,500) for acts wey dey \"indecent  or against nature\" with an individual of di same sex wey dey under di age of 21. Madagascar no recognise same-sex marriage or civil unions. Homosexuality dey legal for Niger but diage of consent no dey equal for same-sex and opposite-sex sexual activity. Same marriage no dey legal for di kontri and LGBT pesins dey face stigmatization among di bigger population. Private, adult, consensual and non-commercial homosexuality dey legal for Mali. Article 179 of di penal code dey punish any act of \"public indecency\" with fines and imprisonment. Most times dem dey use dis code against LGBT pipo wey engage in public display of affection Di cultural and religious beliefs of most Mali kontri pipo dey view homosexual activity and non-traditional gender roles as immoral. Although di kontri no criminalise same-sex relationship but same-sex marriage no follow law and protection no dey for against discrimination based on wetin sexual orientation be or im gender identity. Guinea Bissau change di penal code for 1993 to decriminalise homosexuality for di kontri. For December 2008, Guinea-Bissau become one of di 66 kontris to sign di \"United Nations Statement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity\", wey support decriminalization of homosexuality and transgender identity. Di law for 2011 only recognize heterosexual married couples as entitled to larger government housing. Same-sex sexual activity dey legal for di kontri. Age of consent dey equal, no mata di sex. However, di U.S. Department of State 2010 Human Rights Report find say di kontri dey prosecute any \"individuals wey dey engage in public displays of homosexuality  under public decency provisions in the penal code and articles for di 2006 law on sexual violence. No legal recognition dey for smae-sex marriage. Even as LGBT pesins for di kontri dey face public stigmatization, same-sex union no be crime. For 2004, Cape Verde become di second African kontri to decriminalise homosexuality afta dem amend dia Penal Code to remove all provisions wey dey relate to consensual homosexual sex. On 11 July 2017, Prime Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva say to legalise same-sex marriage no be part of di agenda. Meanwhile, di penalty for discrimination for against sexual orientation na fine wit some moni depending on di case. Under di Penal Code of São Tomé and Príncipe wey take for November 2012, same-sex sexual activity dey legal.  Di age of consent na 16 years rno mata di sexual orientation or gender. As at 2019, only 31 out of 54 African kontris na im dey allow same-sex relationship, oda African kontris get different strict punishment for pipo wey dey practise homosexuality.","category":"africa","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/pidgin\/tori-53231922"}

One out of three of evri woman and girl don experience physical and sexual violence for dia life, according to di UN. E no dey common for man to tok about dia domestic violence palava. Domestic violence against men na taboo for many societies, and di men wey be victims dey suffer dis palava alone. One young man for Ukraine share im story wit di BBC, on condition say dem go keep im identity secret.  Na wetin im tell us be dis, plus some advice wey we collect from sabi pipo on how to recognise di signs of domestic abuse and wetin to do about am. I no know if my friends suspect anytin. Evritin look great from di outside: smiling faces, friends, plenti moni, happiness and confidence. We dey travel half di world togeda.  I no dey fear wen we dey travel, she no go harm me wen pipo dey. My fear na to avoid to dey alone for di same place wit her. Na recently I sabi say my ex-wife dey rape me for 10 years.  Ira na my first woman. We meet wen we dey our 20s - na she ask me out. My parents tell me say I go need comot for house immediately I start to dey date anyone. Dis one mean say, to start relationship mean say I go give up my family and house. Inside one day, I lose evritin. E dey make my liver cut. I only fit afford relationship wen I bin don save plenty moni to live on my own. On top of am, my mama dey shame for me sake of how I look- I bin get very low self-esteem. Di first time wey I bin sleep with Ira back for dat time, I want am. But, e no too dey normal. E dey painful and aggressive. Our first sex bin last for five hours and e pain me well well afta di kerewa. She get dis craze wey be say she must to see sperm in di end. She go rub me until I reach dia. For average, e go last for one to two hours. Pesin suppose enjoy kerewa but e no sweet me. I no get experience and I bin dey think say na like dat e suppose be but I no dey give consent. But e no too tey I sabi to say no be she no stop and na wen e come turn to rape.  I bin need to go overseas on long business trip. I dey fear to lose Ira, so I ask am to follow me. I even offer say I go marry her. She refuse, but she join me las-las. Na where e begin be dat. I don dey overwork and I bin want rest, but she say she wan do kerewa. I agree one time, two times… She go say, \"I want am, I need am, so go give me. I don dey wait for you for long time.\" I go reply, \"No, I no want to, I want rest, I don tired.\" Den she go beat me and notin wey I fit do. She go scratch my skin wit her fingernails till I start to dey bleed, she go punch me.  She no go leave any marks for my face - she go harm only place I fit cover: my chest, back, hands. I no defend mysef becos I bin dey tink say to harm woman dey wrong.  Na how my parent raised me be dat. I be dey feel small, weak and I no fit escape. She go dey ontop of me. I try rent anoda room for mysef for hotel once but I no dey speak dia language so dem no understand me for exception. I come end up trapped.

E be season wey cold and wet and I no carry cloth for cold weather follow me. So, I con get urinary tract infections, prostatitis, and fever. Dis ones no even shake Ira: I need to dey do wetin she want. Na weekend worse pass. E go start from Saturday morning till Sunday night. I don count wen we go leave Ukraine. I tink say dat one go break our relationship but I dey wrong. I go back my parents house and I no wan dey in touch with Ira or even to live with her. But my try to comot for di relationship drag for years. We go fight, I go turn off my phone and even block her for evriwia; I go hide but she go come siddon for door side. She go call and promise say evritin go dey fine. And I go go back to her evri time. I dey fear to dey alone. Wen e start, I bin wan leave am, then I late to give up. I insist say we must marry, and we marry even tho I no want am again. Ira dey jealous evrione: my friends, my family. Wia eva I go, I need to always call her. \"Why I need attend those conferences?\" \"Why need I meet friends?\" I go dey tell her. She no fit go anywhere without me - I be play toy wey need to entertain her all di time. Ira no get job - I provide for us, cook and even clean. We get house wey get two bedroom but she no go gree me use di main bedroom, na di one wey guest dey use I bin give.  Every morning, I need wait till she wake up, na until wen she wake about nine or 10 o'clock or she go say I disturb her sleep. She decide say we go dey sleep for different rooms and my room no get key. I no even fit dey alone.  Wen I be do sometin wrong, she go shout for me and even beat me. Na once a day dis kind tin dey happun or even evri oda day. Anytin wey dey happun - she go blame me. She go dey tell me di kind man wey she need, wetin he suppose do. I dey powerless and I dey do evritin she want so she no go vex. I remember as I go down di stair to go sit inside di car to cry. She waka pass me and see me. Wen I reach house, she say she dey sorry but she no fit stop. So evritin go start again di next day. No matta wetin I do or how bad e do me, nothing change. I no dey perfect. To dey avoid all dis, I use to work 10, 12, 14 hours every day, on weekends and even for holiday time. E dey easy: some pipo dey drink - oda pipo dey choose to work. Alyona Kryvuliak, head of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotline Department, and Olena Kochemyrovska, adviser to the UN Population Fund on prevention and counteraction of gender-caused violence, name these and oda reasons. Wen you dey inside a situation like dat, you no go realize wetin dey happun to you.  You no go see di way out and you no go hear wen you dey situation like dat, you no dey know wetin dey happun to you.  You no dey see di way out and you no dey hear from anyone. You no even dey tink say you get time to escape, e just dey hopeless. I dey tink wetin wey I no want do sake of say I don dey used to am. I dey always owe somebodi sometin and I no even belong to mysef.  I belong to my grandmother, to my parents - I bin always dey tink say you need sacrifice evritin sake of relationship. And so I sacrifice my interests and myself - e look normal to me back then. So evritin get even worse. In di beginning, I no just like am but later, like three to four years of do relationship, I bin dey get heart attack anytime she tok sex. E go happun wen Ira find am and force me. Wen I bin dey used to dey panic, I go push her away, hide, and run - run away from house, or from di room.  Ira think say we dey get sex problems becose of me so she dey carryime go sex doctor evri few years.","category":"world","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/pidgin\/world-52684470"}

{"headline":"Coronavirus lockdown: How di world dey open businesses afta Covid-19?","text":"As di worst of coronavirus be like say e don pass for many kontris, goment dey reduce rules dem put to reduce di spread of di virus. E no go be like di life wey we sabi but at least di public and businesses dem go fit relax from weeks of lockdown. Di way coronavirus don affect plenti kontris dey different so na different ways dem dey comot lockdown but most of di wahala wey dey in front dey similar and na wetin we dey look. Scientists don warn say if authorities too rush with di way dem call of dia lockdown measures, e fit lead to second wave of coronavirus infections even as cases and deaths don dey reduce. Pushan Dutt, professor of Economics at Insead Business School say make kontris use Singapore take do example as dem dey reduce lockdown. Singapore begin see spike for dia numbers afta dem drop di measures dem bin put when dem become one of di most affected kontri afta China for February. In just 3 days dem see 3,000 new cases for April and come put back di lockdown to 1 June. Japan sef bin get second wave for di north of di kontri for Haikkaido city. Di number of new cases bin don go down to zero but by 17 March need dey for second lockdown na why e dey important for oda kontris to keep dat one for mind. Italy, for example, dey reduce dia 7-week lockdown but restaurants and bars dey open only for take-away. Even as parks don reopen, social distancing rules still full ground remain. As dia coronavirus commissioner, Domenico Arcuri tok, \"Di virus still dey among us, e no strong like before but e still dey.\" Dis na as plenti kontris dey look into mass testing as way to avoid second wave. How to restart di economy One of di major reasons to comot lockdown na to reduce di impact wey di pandemic don get on di economy. From small businesses to even multi-nationals sef, many businesses dem don suffer for di pandemic hand. Di International Monetary Fund (IMF) dey expect di world economy go fall by 3% even as dem bin dey expect 6% growth before di pandemic start. Di International Labour Organization (ILO) say work no sure again for about 1.6 billion workers on top say 430 million businesses dey in big trouble. Na why plenti goments for world get stimuli packages for workers and companies. But e go work? E neva still clear. Di IMF director of Research Gita Gopinath tink say di economy of di world go lose US$9 trilliom and dat na for di best case scenario. To go back work Pressure don dey goment neck to reduce restrictions so pipo go fit work. Bangladesh na kontri wey lobby work and dem dey start exit measures. Factories for di textile industries don open plenti last week of April even as di lockdown still dey go on till di middle of May. Bangladesh wey be di second largest explorer of clothes for world dem don dey suffer on top cancellation of orders from Europe and South America. Rubana Huq, president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association say two million of dia workers fit lose dia jobs even with di fear of dia safety as dem dey work. Belgium dey pressure dia workers on safety in fact, one of di busiest ports for di world, Antwerp dey test wristband wey go beep if pesin pass di 2 meter rule for social distancing for di workers. Di wristband sef go help with contact tracing in case of infection and dem also dey test am for America. But no be only factories and services suffer from Covid-19, agriculture dey hear dia own ween because of lack of labour. Di whole supply chain from who dey farm, to di finisihed product don dey face palava, 'e.g India we don lose dia fist harvest of tea leaves cause no bodi dey to pick and go fit lose dia second harvest join and na why dem economies wey dey depend on crops dey press so dat food no go waste. School closures na im almost evri kontri don adopt for dis pandemic. By April 170 of di 193 kontris for UN don close down dia schools according to Unesco. Na like 1.3 billion students don suffer because of di closures. Some kontris don dey reopen and dey look for strategy to make sure say di students and staff dey safe. Some dey reduce di number of pipo for class, UK dey only let year 10 and 12 come back as dem get exams soon, one Chinese school for Hangzhou dey give pikin cap so dem go maintain social distancing. Dem dey do temperature check for Vietnam schools and different time for drop off and pick up of pikin for Norway schools. Denmark dey make dia pikin dem to play for group wey no pass six. While scientists dey fear say opening school fit make children dey share di virus, education sabi pipo say e dey good for dia education and mental health. Pipo wey dey stay for wia dem plenti for dia fit spread coronavirus faster so di wahala now be say as dem lockdown dey end how dem go do normal life safely. Many kontris no wan reduce lockdown restriction for restaurants, pubs and theatres, For Thailand, na cubicle pipo don dey eat inside as dem restaurants don dey get protective barriers and oda kontris don dey tink di same way. For public transport wia social distancing go turn wahala, cities dem get oda plans. Milan wia coronavirus finish work, go get new bike lanes to encourage biking for construction and factory workers. Bogota sef wey be bike friendly city already dey build more bike lanes by di end of April. For Paris, Mayor Anne Hildalgo get plan of 15 minutes city where you fit trek fifteen minutes to anytin you want for di city to avoid motor pollution wen France end dia national lockdown for 11 May. Religious gatherings also chop cane from coronavirus hand and lockdowns. Di pandemic don scata di calendars of plenti faiths. E affect Christianity and Judaism for Easter and Passover, wey be some of dia biggest yearly celebration. Even sef dem cancel di Buddist New Year for South Asia. Dem go fit cancel di annual Hajj Pilgrimage for July in Saudi Arabia ontop dis same Covid-9. But kontris dey wey dey try normalise di attendance for religious events. Iran announce say dem go open mosques for parts of di kontri health authorities say dey free of coronavirus but say make dme do social distancing when dem go to pray. Many religious groups don carry dia faith enter internet as dem dey stuck for house with streaming and sabi pipo tok say dis practice fit no end any time soon. For Italy, goment no dey allow churches to reopen for now, and dat tin don dey vex clerics deem.","category":"world","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/pidgin\/world-52570366"}

{"headline":"Michael Essien African team of di decade","text":"As 2019 don end, Former Chelsea and Ghana star Michael Essien don choose im best 11 African players from 2010 to 2019. Di last 10 years see significant moments for African football, starting wit di World Cup wey happun for di first time for African soil as South Africa host am for 2010. Di decade also end wit di 2019 Africa Cup of Nations wey hold for June and July for di first time instead of di usual January to February calendar. Essien own decade see am win European Champions League title and one FA Cup wit Chelsea as well as runners-up medal for di 2010 Africa Cup of Nations. We ask Essien who be im top players from di last decade. Enyeama na one of di few African goalkeepers to enjoy successful career for Europe. Im win di Israeli League title with Maccabi Tel Aviv for 2013.  Im go on to keep 11 consecutive clean sheets while with Lille and bin dey 115 minutes away from beating Ligue 1 all-time record of minutes-of-clean-sheets set by Gaetan Huard for 1993 wia e play 1,176 minutes without conceding one goal. For national team level, Enyeama help Nigeria win di Africa Cup of Nations for 2013, as di Super Eagles end 19-year wait for di trophy.  Vincent Enyeama arguably be Nigeria best player for di 2014 World Cup wen dem qualify to di knockout stage.  Di former Manchester City captain bin be key member of di Ivory Coast side wey win di Africa Cup of Nations for 2015. For club level, he was one of di first signings by Manchester City owners Sheikh Mansour which serve as star attraction for other big name players to arrive.  Kolo's acquisition signal shift in power for City because im come from direct rival, Arsenal. After a stint with Liverpool wey see am reach di final of di Europa League im end e club career for Celtic, wia e no only did he win the Scottish League titles but also bin be part of di team wey go unbeaten for di league just as im do with Arsenal for 2003-4. Di Cameroonian peak for Tottenham for di beginning of di decade and na one of di best left backs for Premier League under Harry Redknapp.  E impressive performances na di main reason why Gareth Bale, wey be left-back before, move to play advanced role. E form deadly partnership with Bale and dem become problem for right-backs for di Premier League.  Unfortunately for Assou-Ekotto, knee surgery mean say im career go pay di price but e be pesin wey pass expectations and become di best African left-back for Premier League. Benatia bin be big influence for Italian Serie A side Udinese, but na for AS Roma wia di world take notice of am.  Dem name am as di club player-of di-season for 2014 before e join Pep Guardiola Bayern Munich for di end of dat season. Benatia move to Juventus for 2016 wia e help dem win three Serie A titles. Koulibaly na di best defender for Italy for di last three seasons.  Im help Senegal to reach dia first Africa Cup of Nations final for over 10 years dis year and many pipo regard am as one of di best centre-backs for modern day football.

Na sake of to clear dis confusion make Victor Giadom explain give BBC Pidgin why im on Wednesday morning take over as APC Acting national chairman, hours afta di party National Working Comming first appoint former Oyo State govnor Abiola Ajimobi to replace Adams Oshiomhole wey chop suspension.  Latest tori be say di APC National Working Committee (NWC) appoint Hilliard Etta to act on behalf of Abiola Ajimobi wey no dey disposed, but Victor Giadom say all dat one na for dia pocket. E no too tey afta Appeal Court for Abuja rule say di party national chairman Adams Oshiomhole suspension wey FCT High Court grant for March 16 dey valid, na im di party NWC declare Sen. Abiola Ajimobi as acting national chairman. Some hours later, di deputy national secretary of di party Victor Giadom declare imsef as acting national chairman base on di March 16 High Court decision. Oga Giadom tell BBC say, \"I no declare mysef di chairman. Di court order make I serve as acting national chairman. \"I become acting national chairman of dis party through valid court order wey dem give on di 16 of March 2020, and dem neva change di order so I no know wetin di mata be. So until dem cancel di order, I still be di national chairman of APC.\"  But somehow, e be like APC national working committee no recognise di court order, as few hours later dem post for dia official Twitter page say dem \"unanimously appoint di party national vice chairman for south south, Hilliard Etta to act on Abiola Ajimobi behalf.\" On top di appointment of Hilliard Etta, oga Giadom say di tok na for dia pocket becos \"if court order dey and dem no cancel di order, you no fit go do anytin else, anytin you do outside dat order dey invalid.\" Im nullify all Oshio Baba decisions since March including di screening for Edo govnorship candidates. Tori say Victor Giadom declare im sef national chairman of di ruling APC based on Abuja High Court order of March 16, 2020 no be news again.  But how Giadom take land for di centre of dis party politics? Sogboge Eli, na member of APC and insider for activities of di party, im explain say some of di top positions for di party bin dey vacant during di time wey di FCT High Court order Giadom to take charge of di party. \"By di time di order come, di NWC wey national chairman Adams Oshiomhole dey don suspend di deputy national chairman north, di deputy chairman south dey vacant becos di last official, Niyi Adebayo, don become minister of di federal republic and di south west wey dem zone am too neva fill di position.  \"And den di national secretary position too dey vacant becos Mai Mala Buni, go become govnor of Yobe state for northeast Nigeria, so di only senior na di deputy national secretary wey bin dey act as national secretary. In terms of seniority, Victor Giadom na di most senior officer so im come become acting national chairman.\" For pesin wey no bin dey really follow Edo politics before dis time, plenty kwesions fit dey im mind unto how di katakata for di party take reach wia e dey today. For some time now, Oga Adams Oshiomhole AKA 'Oshio Baba' for short and di state govnor Godwin Obaseki bin don dey get kwanta unto who dey run di state. Kasala burst for di state APC for June 2019 afta nine out of 24 State House members gada dem sef elect principal officers for di Edo State House of Assembly. Oshiomhole bin no like di result of di election. Di kwanta enta anoda level wen on Tuesday 12 of November 2019, APC chairman from 18 local goments areas of Edo state suspend Adams Oshiomhole as dem pass vote of no confidence on top. Beginning from Oshiomhole ward, ward 10 of Etsako Local Goment Area, to di local goment proper reach state levels, di party ratify im suspension according to di law.

On March 4, Justice Senchi wey grant di order say political parties must to obey dia constitution, and as im don chop suspension from im ward Oshiomhole no suppose dey work as party chairman. On March 16, Justice Senchi also order make \"Chief Victor Giadom to handle di matas of di 4th defendant (APC) as acting chairman and to chair all di meetings of di national executive committee of di 4th defendant wey dem fix for 17 March, 2020 or any oda date wey dem fix pending di hearing and di decision of di Motion of Notice.\" But dat same day, di embattled chairman sharply cari di mata go Court of Appeal collect \"stay of execution plus appeal di ruling.\" According to Oga Eli, one of di tins wey Oshio Baba do as \"im resume office as national chairman na to lift di suspension of di deputy national chairman north Comrade Mustapha Salihu, den get Ajimobi to take di position of deputy national chairman south west, den put Bulama to step in as national secretary.\" Finally, Appeal Court for Abuja take decision for Oshiomhole prayer to stay execution and appeal Justice Senchi High Court ruling. Di Court of Appeal judgement wey Justice Eunice Onyemanam pass confirm High Court decision to suspend am national chairman of APC. Di court also withdraw all im right and priviledge as di party national chairman including im security men. As tins be so, di Nigeria ruling All Progressive Congress get two acting national chairmen to run di party. According to di party constitution, na only di national executive committee or di national convention of di party members fit to solve dia katakata wey dey dia di goment party apart.

{"headline":"Dbanj and Seyitan: Oladapo Daniel Oyebanjo and Seyitan Babatayo rape accuse story according to Segalink ‘truth’","text":"Segun Awosanya wey be Nigeria social activist don give details of im own side of di rape accuse story against popular Nigeria musician, D'banj. Di news break of June 18 , say police arrest one lady, Seyitan Babatayo wey accuse di popular singer wey real name na Oladapo Daniel Oyebanjo say she rape am for one hotel room in 2018. But di Nigeria police deny di accuse say dem no arrest or detain Seyitan Babatayo, dem tok say dem invite Seyitan and di singer, Dbanj for interrogation and to give dia statement on di accuse, On three different occasions, Seyitan no come, na why we ask di Force CID to send officers from Lagos to invite her for her written statement and interrogation on di alleged rape, according to police claim. Social media bin turn upside down for mid June, 2020 as different reports say Police don arrest Seyitan begin spread. Na so pipo start to dey ask say, \"Wia Seyitan dey?\" Tori be say some policemen from di singer bin allegedly arrest Seyitan for over 24 hours come make her delete evritin wey she bin post about di mata.  While she bin allegedly dey inside police custody, she deny say police arrest.  She also tweet say she don tire for all di drama but di one wey burst pipo head na wen she tweet one of D'banj promo music video. Actress Dorcas Shola Fapson claim say she bin follow Seyitan tok and say true true, dem arrest and seize her properti. Seyitan come meet me first wen di matter break out. Her first complain na  about di DPO of di Bar Beach Police station, she tok say di DPO no treat am fairly.  I tell her to go home wit her friend and relax say I go take di matter up, report di police officer and engage one of our organisation. Di next call wey I get di next day na to tell me about how Dbanj team take respond to di accuse online and how dem file am criminal defamation letter wey I believe say e no dey fear. As we dey plan wetin to do next on dis, I get informate from Seyitan say her friend don get am Lawyer. I dey surprised but I tok say no problem as long as she dey happy to get anoda pesin to represent her. She add am say dem make am sign retainer, di tin vex me say she go get pesin wey go make am sign  binding document even as she dey emotionall disturbed. At dis point , Dbanj team don print criminal defamation letter and dem don publish am and we need respond since dem no even hear her out before dem publish di letter. I no sabi say di Lawyer don notice her emotional state and im sabi say she fit change her mind later, hence di need to make her sign legal document. She tell me how di lawyer act, wey I sabi say na  for her good She tell me  say her lawyer wan her to settle and di tin vex me again.  So I tell her to do wetin di lawyer tok if na wetin she want be dat, I promise say make she call me if she need help. Di next thing I see na calls and texts say dem don arrest and detain her. I ask di pesin to send me di location so I fit can call since na Lagos and I finally got to know say na IRT. I call di contacts there but dem dey out of station yet di pipo on duty respond to me. I still no fit reach Seyitan but still dey try & I ask wia her Lawyer dey. I even tweet about her arrest tok say we go bring di officer to justice, until I got to know say dem carry di lawyer along and dem don even reach agreement for dat meeting. Na there I confam say she no dey under any condition for me to stress myself, so wen dem call me again, I tell dem to rest and call me wen dey are okay, I no sabi say dem don settle di mata even her mum wey want peace support am. Di receipts on di incident at IRT dey available from wen dem invite her to arrest and wen dem settle di mata wit di consent of her parent and her mama. Wetin dey constant for di accuse na di mention say police tell am say dem go arrest her and we no fit get evidence for all dis tok. Even dem misinterpret all di few tok-tok wey I get wit Seyitan based on her concerns, Dem tok say I dey prevent am from listening to all di feminist stories. But dat no be new tin.  Wen di time dey right you go hear from credible parties on our role and how transparent it was even to di point  say we wan feature her for documentary. I no get any issue wit Seyitan and I go always support her no mata what but I believe say dey under undue influence on dis mata wit elements wey wan use am for dia own agenda. Vex no dey if pesin make a case must dis one, I maintain say e must be di will of di individual. Palava bin start early June 2020 wen one Nigerian model scout, Benjamin Ese claim say Dbanj bin rape im friend inside one Lagos hotel for 2018.  Di accuse bin come shortly afta D'banj join oda celebs to preach against rape wia im write say 'No means No'.

Ese claim say di singer bin collect spare key to di lady room from di hotel reception, enta her room come rape her.  (But BBC Pidgin no fit independently verify all dis claim).  Shortly afta she comot from di alleged police detention, Seyitan release official press statement wia she finally admit say four police officers arrest her carry her station for Shodipo, Ikeja. She say di police keep her for almost 48 hours without charges.  Inside di statement, she maintain her claim say D'banj rape her. So far, D'banj neva tok anytin but im post video for im Instagram wia im dey dance to one of im hit songs, 'Olorun Maje' wey mean 'God Forbid'. Di singer bin caption di video 'Innocent until proven guilty'. As e be so, di mata neve reach court but di Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu don order investigation ontop di accuse against di singer.","category":"nigeria","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/pidgin\/tori-53275014"}
{"headline":"Di African-Italians wey wan send migrants home","text":"Tony Iwobi beams as im stand next to pishure of Giuseppe Garibaldi for di Senate building for Rome. Like di 19th Century general, wey help find modern Italy, pipo don call oga Iwobi \"history maker\". Im be Italy first and only black senator.  Iwobi confess say im feel \"like pikin on di first day for school\" when im take e seat alongside di other 320 senators. Im say im get duty, not only to his Italian constituents, but also to di continent wia dem born and raise am: \"Anytin I do today, I no dey do am for myself, but for di nation I represent and for di African black race!\"  Dem elect am last year as part of support for right-wing Lega (League) party, wey form year-long coalition wit the populist Five Star Movement. Now out of power, di League na still Italy most popular party with 33% for di latest polls. Dem dey popular for dia tough stance on migration.  Critics say dem dey use Iwobi wey be di party immigration spokesman as cover for dia \"racist views\". Dem point to one incident for 2013 when one Lega senator refer to Italy first black minister, Cecile Kyenge, as \"orang-utan\".  Mr Iwobi admit his colleague bin dey \"wrong\" but reject di allegation wey say di party dey use am: \"Make dem go search my story,\" im tok. \"Nobody dey use me. I tink wit my own brain.\" Di Nigerian immigrant arrive Italy on student visa for 1977. Im plan before na to return home afta im studies, but tins change afta im mit Italian woman, wey become im wife.  Iwobi join im party, den known as di Northern League, for 1993. For 20 years im serve as local councillor for di northern province of Bergamo. For im office, across di street from di Senate building, hangs a T-shirt wit di slogan \"I stand wit Salvini\" - a sign of im support for im party leader, Matteo Salvini.  Wen im bin dey goment, Mr Salvini famously turned away migrant boats, leaving hundreds stranded for di Mediterranean Sea last summer. But Mr Iwobi insists di League no be anti-immigration.  \"We stand for legal migration. Anybody wey come through di right channel legally dey highly welcomed. We dey for refugees, but we dey against illegal immigration and death tunnel,\" na so Iwobi tok, as im dey refer to di thousands of immigrants wey don die as dem dey try to reach Europe. \"E dey against human dignity.\" Like im party leader, Iwobi see di arrival of plenti African migrants, wey dey cross di desert and sea to land for Italy, as di result of failed migration policy.  His view dey shared by anoda black Italian, Paolo Diop. Now 30, Diop land for Italy from Senegal wen e dey two years. Diop na immigration spokesman for far-right party Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy), wey get roots for Italy old fascist movement.  \"I be di son of immigrants wey arrive Italy legally at a time wen Italy economy bin dey grow. Now no dey grow, so we no fit welcome economic migrants any longer.\"  Mr Diop say im neva experience discrimination, but for February 2018, for Macerata, di town wia im dey live, fellow right-wing activist Luca Traini shoot and wunjure six African migrants.  Mr Diop bin know Traini, wey currently dey serve 12-year jail term.  \"We bin dey di same political circles. Na good pesin im bin be. I no ever get any problems wit am. I no go ever want to inspire someone wey carry out such acts.  Diop say African migrants for Italy need to learn trade den go home and \"make Africa great\".  But so far di message no dey get through.  Musician Tommy Kuti believe right-politicians dey exploit scenes like this. \"Dem like that situation of chaos,\" im tok, \"to scare Italian pipo and make am right for dem to push discriminatory laws.\"  Like Senator Iwobi, dem born Kuti for Nigeria - im move go Italy with im parents wen im small. Now a successful rapper, im music explores identity and politics and dey criticise di League.  \"I tink Toni Iwobi na something wey dey really work against migrants for Italy for time wen we need pipo to fight for us to get us more rights.\"  Kuti tink say white Italians believe \"every black pesin na migrant\".  For Angelica Pesarini, di roots of attitudes to race for Italy dey deep. She dey teach course for Black Italia for New York University in Florence.    \"Italy colonial past - especially di fascist regime - don always dey very connected to ideas of race and whiteness and dis still dey visible nowadays. Becos to be Italian is to be white,\" she explains.  Though born in Italy, Dr Pesarini's family come from Eritrea and Somalia, connection wey go back to Italy colonial adventure for di Horn of Africa.  Pipo from Ethiopia, Somalia and Eritrea grow up learning Italian and absorbing di culture. Those wey move go Italy shock to discover how little Italians know about dem. And even today, many Italians dey ignorant about dia kontri colonial past, na so Dr Pesarini tok.  \"I feel I gats to justify my Italian-ness a lot... People assume I no fit be Italian. And so even wen pipo ask me: ''Wia you I come from?' I go say: 'from Rome'. Den dem go ask: 'No, but wia I really come from?' I den realise how race and colonialism and whiteness dey connected to Italian identity today.\" Activists want di goment to make am easier for second-generation immigrants, those born and raised in Italy, to claim Italian citizenship. Dia biggest opponents na Paolo Diop Brothers of Italy and Senator Iwobi party, di League.  Mr Iwobi dismisses activists' concerns, as im claim say those wey dem den Italian citizenship no follow di regulations. As for those illegal immigrants wey still dey live for Italy, Senator Iwobi want di goment to help dem gain new skills to allow for wetin im call \"voluntary repatriation\".   Rapper Tommy Kuti no agree wit di senator's ideas: \"I tink if im want migrants to stay in Africa, make im set good example and take e ass back to Africa.\" ","category":"africa","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/pidgin\/world-50194398"}

Oga Shehu wey be tok tok person for President Buhari tok for statement. But Oga Femi Falana for im interview with BBC tok plenti things wey make am dey certain say im get proof say President Muhammadu Buhari dey work against di constitution to extend im tenure for office Everything wey we dey see for third term agenda dey exist for Nigeria, as we dey tok, na di current trend for West Africa sub region be dat, Falana tok.  West Africa - Buhari no tok pim for long serving leaders For Benin Republic, President Patrice Talon  don turn di kontri to one party state, even for Togo so dat dem go fit elongate dia tenure for office and Nigeria no do anything about am. President Alpha Condé don silent 12 pipo for im kontri to open way for im third term agenda and even for Cote d'Ivoire, di same thing dey happun Femi Falana add am say, Nigeria wey be di leading member of di Ecowas kontri no criticise all dis agenda wey dey against di constitution. Ecowas protocol dey on democracy and good governance and e no support any form of change of goment wey no follow di constitution. I dey look our past experience and wetin dey happun for di sub regions Na why I conclude say  President Buhari wan do third term.  Press Freedom - Sowore detention case na example For Nigeria, di human rights activist say di signs dey clear, any regime wey no give freedom to di press, turn Nigeria to one party state,  ban pubic protest even if e dey peaceful, give amnesty to terrorist, and e dey harass journalist, dat regime no get respect for rule of law. \"E dey destroy di basis of constitution and na plan to conquer di kontri so dat di third term agenda go dey smooth\"  Dem no arrest Omyele Sowore sake of di protest, dem arrest am make dem for kill Sahara reporters and na Sahara reporters play ogbonge role to spoil Obasanjo third term agenda. I dey defend Sowore because evidence no dey to show why dem accuse am of treasonable felony. I get my proof and I go soon bring am comot. Di warrant wey dem give dem na reproduction warrant and dat wan na accuse say di defendant don fulfil im bail condition, na to come sign make e for dey go Court no talk say make State security service release Sowore to anybody. Di kontri secret police - Department of State Service however tok on Friday say nobody show to collect Omoyele Sowore from dia hand but lawyers of di #RevolutionNow campaign say na lie. Five lawyers spend five hours on Thursday wen DSS say make dem come collect Sowore but dem no release am, dey go dia on Saturday but yet dem still no release am.  One local tori newspaper report am say for Nigeria record, na under di regime of President Muhammadu Buhari, journalist don suffer di worst attack for 34 years But President Buhari don beat chest come outside before say im believe in press freedom.  President vs Vice President kwanta - Di way Buhari dey treat Osinbajo  Di ogbonge lawyer say wen sitting President harass Vice President and render am useless sotee e no allow am contest wetin di goment dey do or get ambition to succeed di President, e dey clear say something dey happun. Just days agao, na like 35 Senior Special Assistants to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo wey dey work inside di office of di President naim chop sack. But Garba Shehu,  di tok-tok pesin to di President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday explain say di reason why dem drop some staff wey dey work with vice president, Yemi Osinbajo na to reduce di cost of goment and make decision-making dey smooth. Rule of Law - Failure to obey court oders Nothing don happun to di pipo wey dey campaign for third term but di pipo wey campaign against di disobedience of rule of law dey under arrest.\" Femi Falana tok Im say, wen dem tell you say bill wey parliament pass, dem fit sign am from anywhere against wetin di law tok den no be for nothing, na to make sure say dia third term agenda dey road. Recently, di Buhari goment don dey boast say dem don destroy di opposition for Nigeria and dis no be joke, No goment go tell you say e dey plan third term agenda, na for di masses to find out wetin all dis undemocratic process dey about. Court don order state security service to produce Sowore for court but dem no obey di court rule. Wen, lawyer, Aka Bashorun accuse Babangida say e dey plan third term we no believe am until we begin see evidence of a dictator wey no wan comot office even wen dem force am out e say e dey step aside with intention say e dey come back to goment. Di Nigeria law book (constitution) no create room for di President to seat for office more than two times of four years each. Wen Buhari bin contest im election for 2015 e bin tell tori pipo say im go only do one term and den go rest, but dat one change for 2018 wen di president declare to run for a second term.

{"headline":"Coronavirus: Garlic, heat, ice cream dey among fake COVID-19 disease advice you need to ignore","text":"Coronavirus outbreak alias COVID-19 disease wey dey affect more and more kontries around di world don make some pipo dey give different heath advise online as e be say di disease neva get any cure.  We wan torchlight some of di popular myths or fake claims wey pipo don share online about wetin fit cure di virus and explain wetin science tok concerning di claim. Plenti posts for facebook advice pipo say make dem dey chop garlic to prevent infection. World Health Organization (WHO) tok say while garlic na \"healthy food wey fit get some antimicrobial properties\", e no get any evidence or proof wey show say if pesin chop am, e fit protect dem from di new coronavirus.  Also too much garlic fit sometimes cause harm to pesin bodi, for example, South China Morning Post report one tori of one woman wey dem rush go hospital for treatment sake of say her throat swell up afta she chop 1.5kg of raw garlic.  We know, in general, say eating fruit and vegetables and drinking water dey good for staying healthy. But no evidence don show say some kian food fit help fight dis particular virus. Plenti advise don full social media wey say heat dey kill coronavirus, and so make pipo dey drink hot water, take hot baths, or use hairdryers.  One fake post wey no truly come from Unicef but wey plenti pipo from different kontries copy and paste - claim say drinking hot water and exposure to sun go kill di virus, plus make pipo avoid ice cream  Charlotte Gornitzka, wey dey for Unicef on coronavirus misinformation, tok say:  \"Dat recent lie-lie online message... wey pipo claim say na Unicef post am, wey dey advise pipo to avoid ice cream and oda cold foods to help prevent di disease. no be true at all, na big lie.\" We know say di flu virus no dey survive well outside di body during hot weather, but we neva get evidence wey prove how heat dey affect di new coronavirus. Gornitzka, tok One sabi pesin, Professor Sally Bloomfield say Trying to heat your body or expose yoursef to di sun -  to prevent di virus - no dey work at all.  Once di virus dey your body, e no get any way wey you fit take kill am- your body just need to fight am off.   Outside di body, \"to actively kill di virus you need temperatures of around 60 degrees\", and dis dey far hotter than any bath or sauna. Professor Bloomfield tok. Washing bed linen or towels at 60 degrees na good idea, as dis fit kill any virus for di material. But no be good option for washing your skin. And bathing hot water or drinking hot liquids no go change your actual body temperature, wey remain stable unless you already dey sick.  One post, wey plenti pipo for Facebook copy and paste quote one \"Japanese doctor\" wey recommend say make pipo dey drink water every 15 minutes to flush out any virus wey fit don enta di mouth. One version of dis post inside Arabic language don get more than 250,000 shares. Professor Bloomfield tok say no evidence don show say drinking water every 15 minutes go help.  Airborne virus dey enta di body through di respiratory tract wen you breathe in. Some of dem fit  go inside your mouth, and even drinking water no go prevent you from catching di virus. Anyway shall, drinking water and to stay hydrated na generally good medical advice. One YouTube pesin, Jordan Sather, wey get thousands of followers, claim say \"miracle mineral supplement\", wey dem dey call MMS, fit \"wipe out\" coronavirus. Di tin contain chlorine dioxide - bleaching agent.     Sather and odas promote di substance even before di coronavirus outbreak, and for January e come tweet say, \"no be only say chlorine dioxide (aka MMS) dey strong for cancer cell killer, e fit wipe out coronavirus too\".  Last year, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sama warning about di health danger wey dey if pesin drink MMS. Health authorities for oda kontries also bring out alerts about dis substance. Di FDA say  \"dem no know of any research wey show say dis products dey safe or fit treat any illness\".

Di centre dey open at 8am but close wen di laboratorian don tire. \"Di Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) na heat chamber and e dey very, very hot,\" Akintayo explain. Covid-19 dey transmissible through droplets wey infected person release. Experts say di virus fit stay active ontop surfaces wey di droplets land for days.

Di patients go get get dia result in three working days.  Testing time dey different. E dey range from days to few hours. For Australia, results sometimes dey take up to four days before di patients go know dia status. But, for UK, di officials bin dey target to dey comot results within 24 hours  so dat patients fit dey releive say dem no get covid-19 or dem go quick start treatment.  \"Environmental officer dey manage di waste we generate from di centre.

{"headline":"Community transmission of Coronavirus COVID-19 wetin e mean? - Di ansa and how to stop am dey here","text":"Officials for Nigeria say di kontri dey for di stage where COVID- 19 dey spread for community.  But wetin be community spread, and dem fit stop am? Community spread mean say someone wey dey infected but health officials no dey sure as to where or how e take catch di virus. When di outbreak bin first start, pipo wey dey at risk of di infection na dos wey just travel come from areas wey dey affected. Di first cases wey dey that time, na from pipo wey go Wuhan China, where di outbreak first start. But as di disease continue to dey spread for di world, pipo begin catch am afta dem travel to places like Italy, Kentucky and California. Community spread begin dey popular since late February, wen one pesin wey no get any recent travel history test positive for di virus for California. For Texas, dem report di first case of community spread for 11 March afta one Houston man wey no get any  travel history or near anyone wey fit don dey exposed to di virus test positive. City officials and health experts don take serious actions like closing of schools and businesses because di virus go dey very hard to control once e begin spread from one pesin to anoda for inside community. Health experts say na through social distancing, when you no go where plenty pipo gada, no near anybody and make di distance between you and anoda pesin no too dey close, na wetin fit stop or slow community spread. Di idea of social distancing (dey your lane) don make many pipo begin work from house for dia companies, many kontris don cancel events wey fit make plenty pipo gada and plenty sporting events don cancel. Dr. John Carlo, former Dallas County medical director and CEO of Prism Health North Texas, say social distancing wey come in a way, wey go make many events cancel, na  di first sure way to take control di outbreak. Health experts say other things wey pipo fit do na to wash hand always, cover your mouth with toilet rolls or your elbow when you cough and sneeze and dey always clean things for house and when you touch anywhere, all na ways community spread fit stop. E be like say we no dey get pipo wey sick well-well maybe because of di lockdown and maybe because those wey weak pass - old pipo for example no dey exposed (as part of di lockdown) and because most of our population dey young. Half of us dey under di age of 18, e pipo like say di tin no dey hold dem like that. Na wetin Dr. Orode O. Doherty, di Medical Director for Ingress Health Partners tell BBC Pidgin Di only real way to stop to dey infect others whether inside community or any other place na for pipo to avoid each other. Di virus no fit live outside of our body… di only way e dey spread na when one pesin give anoda pesin. Doherty add. Dis no dey possible because e go mean say di serious lockdown wey we don see dey cause hunger and insecurity. So we need to change di way we dey behave to allow us do social distancing but at di same time e no go stop important areas of di economy to kontinu to dey work until di spreading reach zero, or we get vaccine for am, di Medical Director for Ingress Health Partners tell BBC Pidgin She say In di meantime we need to increase our testing and find those wey fit don get di virus. Dis go allow us to maintain our economy - as we dey do social distancing, give protection to old and pipo wey no well, reduce how we dey gada for public, to dey wear masks, not to stop washing of hands, and to give support to di poor and those wey need treatment. On top dis one make we no forget we get medical workers wey dey face di virus both for public and private sectors, wey if dem no get Personal Protective Equipment, e go cause dem serious gbege and take us back. Also put am for mind say if di economy drop to zero, too many people go die of hunger- young pipo wey we no fit afford to lose. Pipo need to work and pipo need to farm and make food etc.  So now Nigeria dey deal with plenty poverty,  different different community wey no gel, public health system wey don kpafuka, and how di economy dey depend on importation to produce wetin we even need to take face di palava well well and package oursef. Like many private sector providers for Lagos we don dey allow pipo to use phone to get medical advice, to educate our patient, to make sure we dey use social media to reach di general public and to make sure say we support for pipo wey get specific need.  We dey collaborate with private providers for Lagos, to support di work wey private practitioners dey do. Also, we don dey epp pipo wey dis tin fit affect easily, old pipo, pipo wey sick, pregnant women and women wey just born and pikin wey get need medical attention. We dey do dis through social media like Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp. Also zoom meetings and insta- live sessions, she tok.","category":"nigeria","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/pidgin\/tori-52476246"}
{"headline":"Coronavirus domestic violence: Surviving lockdown wen you dey trapped with your abusive partner","text":"Di United Nations don describe violence against women during di coronavirus lockdown as \"shadow pandemic\".  Across Africa, goments, police and activists report increase in attacks on women and girls wey trap for lockdown with abusive partner or relative. So wetin you fit do if you find yourself in dis kain of situation? We ask experts and one survivor of domestic abuse to share dia advice.  \"Wen you dey for inside abusive relationship, you go notice one pattern,\" Esther* tell me, as she tink back to di three years she spend married to man wey she tok say bin dey abuse her  regularly - physically and verbally.  \"Weekends dey always worse, because everybody dey for house. Your partner get more time for dia hands and fit get bored too. So you go see say dem wan find trouble. Dem go set you up - say something wey go make you react and den hit you wen you react.  \"If two days fit make pesin dey bored enough to make dem wan hit you, imagine wetin one month or so of lockdown don cause pipo. No be just boredom dis time, na stress, na fear.\"  Several years don pass now since Esther leave her husband. And even though, practically, e bin dey more easier to comot dan e go be today, e still take time and courage.  ''I feel say I dey place wia get bars and I no fit comot because economically, emotionally, psychologically, e hard well well - and den my children dey too. Also, your mama dey happy say you don marry, so you dey reason - keep her happy. Stay.'' For women wey wan leave dia partner now during lockdown, di challenge dey even bigger. If dem try to leave, police fit challenge dem say dem break curfew and dem fit struggle to find public transport.  Many kontries don set up helplines, dey offer advice and support to victims. Demand for dia services dey high.  During di first week of lockdown for South Africa, police receive 2,320 reports of gender-based violence - 37% higher dan usual. For Zimbabwe, one helpline say di number of abuse cases dem document bin triple, while Nigerian gender advocate, Dorothy Njemanze, tell BBC News say she dey worried by di rise of abuse cases for her kontri: \"We fear say if e continue dis way, we fit record some deaths before di lockdown over.'' Some African states dey take practical steps to help women. For Tunisia, wey don see five-fold increase in reports of domestic violence, di goment don set up free helpline and allocate eight shelters for victims and dia children, with more facilities on di way. For some oda place dem, many shelters don manage to stay open and volunteers dey able to help women to escape.  For Zimbabwe, di Roots One Stop Shelter dey currently house 21 adults and seven children. Di director, Beatrice Savadye, say dem dey manage to rescue women from dia homes and dey also get referrals from police.  For Kenya also, social worker Dianah Kamande say shelters still dey able to house women and say her organisation don already rescue 17 women for Nairobi alone.  For Nigeria, although most women shelters don close as part of di lockdown, volunteers still dey able to help women escape and move in with dia relatives, according to Titilayo Vivour, di coordinator for di Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team.  But for Ghana main safe house, di Ark Shelter, director Nana Sunnu say dem dey unable to take in new clients because of di infection risk and lack of quarantine facilities.  Esther, wey survive violent marriage and dey work with fellow survivors now, say make women still call di helpline even if dem dey for kontri wia di shelters dey closed.  \"Try and reach out to activists wey dey for social media, activists wey you fit trust. Call dem, dem fit still do something even for dis lockdown situation.''  Make Communities also look out for neighbours wey dem tink say fit dey exposed to violence, according to South African psychologist Nthabiseng Ramothwala. She also advise women to seek help from di pipo around dem. ''Know police officers and emergency numbers you fit call,\" she tell BBC. \"Involve your neighbours as well, tell dem signs to look out for so you to know wen to help. Give dem numbers of close relatives wey fit come rescue you.\"  And for those wey really fit no escape, Esther get some final advice.  \"You no need to stop your voice to make someone else feel better, but for dis situation, if dem tok something wey pain you, just ignore dem. If dem annoy you, go read book, do something else  to take your mind away from dem. ''If you fit survive di next one or two or three months... den do whatever you need to do. I no know if we fit call these kinds of measure solutions. Dem just be stop-gap measures.  \"Right now we dey try to survive, so say wetin dem need to hear, do wetin dem need you to do. Just survive dis.\" ","category":"africa","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/pidgin\/tori-52675405"}

One of di farmers, Ayo Ominrin tell BBC News Pidgin say di disease don kill ova 300,000 pigs since di outbreak start for February 2020. \"Around late February we begin notice say pigs dey die, e start for some parts of di farm and e begin dey spread to di oda parts and wen we run test, dem confam say na African swine fever.\" Oga Ayo tok. Since dat time we don lose plenti pigs, we no even tok say dis na di numbers of pigs wey don die sake of di fever but we don lose over 300,000 pigs, im add. Di disease don affect 99 percent of di over 3,000 pig farms wey dey di Oke Aro farm settlement for area wey share boundary of Ogun State and Lagos, Nigeria bizness capital.

Na wit smile, abi make dem no send or make dem tink am well? Wetin e go mean for Africa if power change hand inside di same party for far way Britain? Di era of empire plus telegram from Colonial Office for Whitehall don pass tey tey. Na so too wit di time wey Africa pipo bin dey send di politics of di kontri wey bin get di riches of half of di world for im hand. Dis days UK sanitation inspectors plus oda goment officials dey galavant different parts of Africa but nobodi dey notice and nobodi send dem. Na di same tin, to some extent wit Britis royal family sef. And na so e suppose be. Africa dey change fast. Today, na Chinese goment officials dem dey happy to welcome as dem cari cheques come, dem dey also welcome solar power investors from United Arab Emirate and India, actors and music celeb dem from US, Russia nuclear officials and Brazil business men. Now too dem don dey seriously throw red carpet for wey from oda Africa kontris - as continent wey bin dey disconnected before don dey come togeda due to di road and train  dem wey China dey build, to begin focus more on demsef instead of on outsiders for help on top tins wey dem fit do for demsef. True, Commonwealth still dey useful. And true, e dey possible say one day one day dem fit get trade deal wit UK and dat too dey important. But na also true say Africa dey for di back of di queue for any of dis deals and who know wen e go eva happun? \"Dis one go take many years before e go happun and dat go mean say Africa go wait tire,\" na so British peer Lord Peter haain  tok. E say even if dem get smooth Brexit, \"dat one still mean say di transition go tey...and na complicated road dey for front.\" UK dey enjoy close relationship wit many parts of Africa and dat no go change. But for now, Africa get plenty tins wey dey worry and wahala of Brexit no follow. For many years di bureau bracy for EU almost kee instead of to encourage business wit Africa. If oga Johnson goment fit to break di EU bondage, dis continent - wit im strong language relationship, history and culture plus im appreciation of British value -  go jump at opportunity of new partnership and business deal wit London. \"Brexit dey good for Africa. Boris Johnson and im goment in particular good for am. Reztrictions bin increase [under EU],\" Rob Hersoy on south Africa wey be founder and chairman of Invest Africa tok. If Britain goment leave EU den, oga Hersoy predict say, \"doors go open.\" Di reality be say Africa get positive view of Britain. Everybodi go line up to do deal.\" im tok. Na true say China don dominate investment for Africa for about twenty years now, and say UK and US go try catch up. But di structure wey Bejing dey build don help open new market plus opportunity for kontris and companies ready to take di opportunity. Still, Africa dey too big and to complicated to just look am from di side of business. Security, climate change, migration plus oda health emergency like Ebola dey important, and for each of dis wahala UK go continue to play important role - and dem no go change just change becos Johnson dey goment. UK fit still dey contribute 0.7% of im kontri income for foreign help and development. But oga Johnson goment fit prefer to focus im support Africa business pipo. Why Africa gatz try overlook di many bad tok wey UK new prime minister don tok about dia continent all dis years? Oga Johnson fit dey hope say dem go dismiss some of im toks wey im tok before as play. Make we no for say im write one time about UK and Africa relationship say \"di problem no be say we bin dey in charge once upon a time, but say we no dey in charge again.\" Many Africa goment fit wan ignore im tok and focus on di future. But e dey clear say, oga Johnson behaviour wen im be UK foreign secretary no only offend Africa pipo, e cause some damage. For example, di issue of decolonisation and di continent support for Mauritius as e fight wit UK on top ownership of Chagos Islands. UK isolation for Europe sake of Brexit, di yeye way wey oga Johnson take handle Chagos mata and di way Africa dey unite and dem no get patience for nonsense, all help push United Nations to ignore London protest and to sama dem humiliating defeat for UN and International Court of Justice (ICJ). Finally, assuming Brexit happun, and UK become free to begin - or even to complete like di case of kontri like South Africa - negotiate new business deal, e fit sharply discover say,  as im no dey EU market wit 500million consumers, Africa kontris go make di bargain hard.

But for part of di video wey still dey circulate, di pastor claim say na di 5G network dey make pipo sick and no be coronavirus.  BBC Pidgin tok to sabi pipo wey tok say im yan na lie.  Abdulrahman Odunaye, Network solution Architect wey dey live and work for di Middle East, explain give BBC Pidgin say 5G no get connection with di coronavirus pandemic. \"No correlation between 5G and coronavirus. If we even wan go into science of di whole thing, even if electro-magnetic waves go harm you, e no go metamorphose into virus. If to say coronavirus dey show like cancer, e fit get scientific backing because some pipo for science dey believe say electro-magnetic waves dey cause cancer,\" na how Odunaye take chook mouth for di tori wey di pastor bin give.  One doctor wey go Havard University and currently base for US, Joshua Adeoye, explain further for anoda interview with BBC pidgin say viruses dey behave different from cancer for bodi.   \"Viruses bi organisms, like bacteria. So when dem enter bodi, dem dey always look to take over dia host cell system, so dey fit use dat system , replicate demsef, Adeoye tok. \"Cancer for di oda hand, be deranged growth. Abnormal cells wey suppose die but continue to dey happun at abnormal and uncontrolled rate. \"While virus fit take over di cell apparatus to create imsef (so di cell no go fit replicate imsef), di cancer cell dey replicate on im own. Na so Adeoye conclude. Oyakhilome for di video also claim say di reason Nigerian goment, like oda goment for di world, lock down Abuja and Lagos na to enable dem install di 5G cables.  First, di Federal Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy don tok say Nigeria no get di new wireless technology.

Even though Lesotho get some presence of 5G, no single case of coronavirus dey di kontri as at di time Oyakhilome tok im tok, and no case even at di time wey we write dis report. Odunaye say: \"If di 5G dey directly related to di coronavirus, then I fit say make Nigeria no worry about coronavirus because 5G no dey Nigeria. Na only one network don run test for 5G for Nigeria and right now dem don stop as dem hit major road block.\" Oyakhilome also tok say to dey stay for house no dey scientific and e no go protect person on top dis virus. He come laugh di instruction wey everybody for di world dey observe as one measure to take stop di spread of di virus.  \"Why we dey stay inside house,\" he ask. \" Shey di virus dey fly pass, so we dey wait am make e pass? Why we dey inside? Scientifically, dis na di most foolish tin I don see. No science dey for dis. E dey stupid.\"Oyakhilome tok.

{"headline":"Yasuke: Di ogbonge African samurai","text":"Almost 500 years ago, one tall African man land for Japan. E go later become di first foreign-born man to achieve di status of samurai warrior, and e also be di subject of two feems wey Hollywood dey produce. Dem call am Yasuke, di man na warrior wey reach di rank of samurai under di rule of Oda Nobunaga - one powerful 16th Century Japanese lord wey be di first of di three pipo wey unify Japan. No be small tin im arrival for Kyoto, di capital at dat time for 1579, cause, sotay pipo bin climb over one anoda to see am, according to sabi pesin ontop history Lawrence Winkler, some pipo die afta dem crush dem to death as dem dey hustle to see im face. Inside one year, Yasuke shaparly join di upper warrior class of Japan, di samurai. E no too tey too before im sabi speak Japanese well-well, dey ride with Nobunaga for battle. \"Im height be 6 shaku 2 sun (roughly 6 feet, 2 inches (1.88m)... e black, and im skin be like charcoal,\" im fellow samurai, Matsudaira Ietada, bin describe am for im diary for 1579. Di average height of Japanese man dat time for 1900 na 157.9m (5 feet 2 inches) so Yasuke go don tall pass most of di Japanese pipo for di 16th Century, time wen pipo dey generally shorter because of bad nutrition. Records of Yasuke date or di kontri wia dem born am no dey. Most historians say im come from Mozambique but some don suggest oda kontries like Ethiopia or Nigeria. Wetin pipo sabi na say, Yasuke land Japan with one Italian Jesuit, Alessandro Valignano, to do one inspection tour, im appear for history wey dem record only between 1579 and 1582. Some sabi pipo say im be slave, but e dey hard to conclude. Floyd Webb and Deborah DeSnoo, filmmakers wey dey do di documentary on im life, believe say tok say im be slave na just tok-tok.  \"E for dey impossible for Yasuke to rise to di rank of samurai in just one year without warrior background,\" Ms DeSnoo tok.  Samurais dey most time start dia training from childhood.  E no too tey wen Yasuke land Japan wen e meet Nobunaga and im generate interest for am, di feem makers dem say dis wan happun as a result of im conversation skills. Yasuke bin don already sabi speak small Japanese and di two men flow well-well, according to sabi pesin Thomas Lockey, wey don write book ontop Yasuke. According to Mr Lockey, Yasuke entertain Nobunaga with tori from Africa and India, where Mr Lockey believe say Yasuke bin don spend some time before e go Japan. Yasuke totori French-Ivorian writer Serge Bile sotay im write book about di warrior. \"Na part of di mystery wey surround am. Na why e dey totori me,\" e tell BBC. Nobunaga begin like Yasuke, like am sotay im treat am like family - di African dey among  selected group of pipo wey im allow to siddon chop with am.  \"Nobunaga hail Yasuke strength and stature, e describe im might like dat of 10 men,\" Ms DeSnoo says. Wen Nobunaga make Yasuke samurai, dem bin never tink am say pesin wey no come from Japan fit become samurai. Later, oda foreigners too go begin collect di title.  As di first foreign-born samurai, Yasuke fight important battles togeda with Oda Nobunaga. Yasuke also dey dia on dat fateful night wey one of Nobunaga generals, Akechi Mitsuhide, betray and put fire for di warlord palace , trap Nobunaga inside one of di rooms. Nobunaga take im own life through di performance of seppuku, wey be suicide ritual.  Before e kill imself, e ask Yasuke to comot im head and take im head and sword to im son, according to historian Thomas Lockley. Dis na sign of great trust.   Di legend of Yasuke end small time afta dis event, for 1582. Di fall of Nobunaga for di hands of di disloyal general lead to di banishment of di first black samurai, maybe back to im Jesuit mission for Kyoto.  Although im fate and di last years of im life no clear, Yasuke continue to dey live on for di mind of many Japanese wey grow up with di award-winning children tori book Kuro-suke (kuro wey mean \"black\" for Japanese) wey Kurusu Yoshio write. Di book, wey act Yasuke life, end wan kain: afta Nobunaga kill imself, dem carry Kuro-suke (Yasuke) go one temple wia im cry and also dream of im parents for Africa. Entertainment industry newspaper Variety report for May say Black Panther actor Chadwick Boseman go play Yasuke inside one feem wey dey come soon. E go be di second Hollywood feem wey dem go do ontop di life of Yasuke.  For 2017, Hollywood studio Lionsgate announce say dem dey do feem ontop di life of di black samurai. Nearly 500 years later, Yasuke ogbonge life still dey totori and inspire people.","category":"africa","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/pidgin\/tori-50046613"}
{"headline":"Coronavirus Symptoms: Full explanation of Covid-19 outbreak, everitin you need to know","text":"Di Coronavirus wey start from one town for China for late 2019 don turn to global serious mata. Coronavirus don claim more than 156,000 lives and infect nearly 2.3 million pesins for di world. Among dem na di UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson wey don begin dey recover afta dem treat am for hospital. Di World Health Organization (WHO) wey be di joinbodi of sabi pipo wey dey torchlight health mata around di world, declare di Coronavirus aka Covid-19 disease as global pandemic on 11 March 2020. Na exactly three months since di first Covid-19 patient Wei Guixian begin feel sick - and since den world goments dem don dey prepare to stop di spread and cure those wey e don catch. Di virus, wey dem don officially name Covid-19, na new strain of coronavirus wey dem neva see for human body before. Di virus fit affect di lungs, and cause cold and catarrh. E fit spread from pesin to pesin through coughing and sneezing. Coronavirus still dey spread and e don claim more than 157,000.  Some studies tok say up to 80% of dos wey get di virus no go get serious symptoms, na only small number of pipo go show very serious symptoms of di disease. World Health Organization don advise pipo to avoid \"unprotected\" contact with live animals, and make dem cook meat and eggs well-well. WHO dey encourage pipo to do social distancing.  Dis one mean say make pesin try to avoid touch-touch wit oda pipo, especially di ones wey dey show signs of di disease. E also mean pesin go avoid wia plenty pipo dey or gada for, like bars, swimming pool, cinemas, restaurants, theatres, gym and social gathering. Di main symptoms include; E dey take up to five days before symptoms begin dey show but for some pipo e no dey show early. Di World Health Organization say di incubation period dey last up to 14 days. Patients wey dia symptoms no too serious, make dem self-isolate for house for at least seven days. If pesin don dey in contact with pesin dem suspect say get coronavirus, or e don go area wey di virus don spread enta, di advice of health sabi pipo na to do 'self-isolation'.

And say no be dem tell oga Trump dat kain tin. Again World Health Organisation never comot to say dis na how to treat. Di advice to avoid touch-touch wit patient and to report if you get di symptoms, still dey valid as we dey write dis tori. Di number of pipo wey dey die from Covid- 19 dey between 1% to 2% but dis figures no dey reliable. One World Health Organization (WHO) examination of data from 56,000 patients suggest say: As at 20 March, di coronavirus COVID-19 dey affect 182 countries and territories around di world and 1 international ship (di Diamond Princess cruise ship wey don park for Yokohama, Japan).

{"headline":"10 things wey dey cause poverty for northern Nigeria","text":"One recent report from World Bank estimate say 87% of poor pipo inside Nigeria come from northern part of di kontri. Di report say poverty rate for di southern part of di kontri don drop from 2011 to 2016, while almost half of di 87% dey for north east states (Borno, Yobe, Adamawa, Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba).  Wetin fit be di reasons wey dey make poverty rate for northern Nigeria dey increase?  We ask Professor Garba Ibrahim Sheka, Engineer Yabagi Sani and  Malam Ibrahim Disina, one Islamic scholar, for di answer and dis na di 10 reason why: Energy expert Engineer Yabagi Sani tok say economic difference between north and south regions start right from dia system of belief as a society.  \"Pipo for north get too much belief in destiny and Allah instead of dia own strength and ability,\" Yabagai tok.  \"Southern pipo no dey always behave like dis as dem dey act according to dia own strength than to leave everything for di hand of destiny. Dis behaviour get im own disadvantage but e dey economically important.\"  Bayero University Kano professor, Garba Ibrahim Sheka remember how im bin dey see beautiful farmlands of guinea corn around Bama and Gwoza towns of Borno State, but dem no dey dia again because of Boko haram.  \"We bin dey enjoy di fine view of guinea corn farm wey no dey dia any more. Those farmers na dem dey stay for IDP camps now.  \"Those pipo bin dey produce food for sales but now na pipo dey feed dem as IDPs. Dis show poverty.\"  Islamic scholar Malam Ibrahim Disina believe say begging dey amongst di reasons why poverty dey worry pipo for north.  Malam Disina claim say wetin prophet Muhammad PBUH tok be say \"whoever open door for begging, Almighty Allah go open for am door to poverty\".  Big difference dey for di population between north and south, and according to Garba Sheka \"dis no dey help di north because dem no dey productive\".  \"Na for here inside di north men go marry four wives and born 20 children. For di South e dey hard to find family of more than five. \"I get one neighbour wey marry four wives and each of dem dey live for separate rented apartment, and di man na messenger under state goment ministry.\" Professor Garba Sheka argue say pipo no fit get goment jobs without education and di north dey far behind, whilee no be like dat for di south.  \"Even educated workers dey go through training and workshops to improve dia work let alone those wey no school at all.\" Garba Sheka add say goment for di region abandon di education sector, \"dem dey only focus on infrastructures wey dem use take campaign during elections\".  Concerning im neighbour with four wives, di professor tok say: \"How im go think about im children education and dia up bringing?\"  \"Dis one get to do with how pipo dey associate with one anoda for di north because, na for hia you go find one family dey rely on one rich member from dat family,\" Engineer Yabagi Sani tok. E add say pipo fit depend only on someone else and pipo dey help one anoda well-well, while most pipo for south dey struggle for demsef  \"Although to help each oda dey good, e dey also kill di ginger of some pipo wey suppose hustle to succeed.\"  \"You know say northern pipo no dey like make dia wives border demsef with how to manage di family talkless about for dem to get own business,\" Yabagi Sani continue.  \"Na only recently wey you fit see women dey go for higher education, even so plenti of di men no want dia wives to work. \"Woman fit get degree and stay for home.\"  Everibodi  known say some pipo dey use marketing strategy to hide some product particularly seasonal ones upon di high demand for market.  Malam Ibrahim Disina describe dis as something wey dey ungodly and dis dey increases di rate of poverty among pipo. Engineer Yabagi Sani and Malam Disina blame politicians' habit of stealing public funds as di reason for poverty rate wey increase.  Yabagi tok say \"E dey very bad how political office holders dey tiff public money for dia families instead of to use am for di good of kontri pipo\". \"You can see many youth empowerment programs, you go find out say di pipo wey dem train go come go sell di equipment wey dey give dem for market\" Professor Garba Sheka tok. Oga Sheka say e get one time wey im head one team of resource pesin for dis kind programmes and later find out say di contractor wey supply di equipments buy dem from pipo wey dem don bin train.  \"Even di amount of money wey dem give dem as capital no fit rent shop for market,\" di professor add.

Upon say some national football govning body dem don raise di age cut-off for mixed teams for youth level, but for professional game dat mata na no go area. Now at 32, Labbe don become di latest challenger to gender separation for di top level of di game.

One political analyst Dr Abubakar Kari of University of Abuja tok say so far, many Buhari close associates dey ground wey im feel say fit be replacement for oga Kyari.  \"I think Buhari fit pick either Ambassador Babagana Kingibe, Nigeria Custom Chief Rtd Conel Hameed Ali or Minister of Education Malam Adamu Adamu as im new Chief of Staff, \" Dr Kari add. Oga Kingibe and late Kyari na both from Borno state and oga Kingibe don bin dey ogbone offices before.  Kingibe also get good close relationship with di president currently, according to Dr Kari.  Equally di analyst tok say Malam Adamu and Colonel Ali also don enjoy di same, if not much closer relationship with Buhari.  \"So e no go come as surprise, if Buhari decide to pick from di two,\" e add.   According to Dr Kari, di office of chief of staff to di president na very important one, but you no fit compare am with di office of state governor. \"And so, na opposite to wetin some pipo dey tink, e go dey very difficult to justify Kaduna State Governor Nasir el-Rufai as possible replacement to late Abba Kyari,\" e tok. Some also tink say, President Buhari fit by imsef pick im former Minister of Interior AbdurRahman Dambazau because according to dem, e don dey eye di office for years.  But Dr Kyari tok say, considering di fact say Buhari no re-appoint am as minister for 2019, \"I think Mr Dambazau too dey out of di race.\" Wen we contact APC National Welfare Officer Alhaji Ibrahim Masari, e tok say e go dey too early to start to dey tok about issues like dat. \"Since no be elected position and vote dey involve, therefore we need to dey patient and wait for di President to pass through dis grieving period.\" \"Den later, e fit tok di right pesin wey go occupy dis ogbonge office,\" Masari tok. Since afta di re-election of Buhari for 2019, Kingibe don build good relationship with di current goment especially because e come from di same state of Borno as Abba Kyari. Even though di role wey im play for di past goment because former President Umaru Yar'Adua dismiss Kingibe as SGF afta Yar'Adu's return from medical vacation, fit affect am. And di incidents follow di cancelling of MKO Abiola election for 1993, Kingibe na di running mate of Abiola but di Head of State dat time, General Sani Abacha later appoint am as minister of interior. For the above reasons, some especially from South-West region of di kontri fit no dey comfortable with am. But Kingibe get di know-how and experience of public service. Na im be di custom oga for Nigeria. Rtd Colonel Ali don dey work with President Buhari since dia military days. Many pipo dey see am as one of di few pipo Buhari put for position of trust.  Colonel Ali close associate always dey give testimony of di way im no dey corrupt at all and e dey always follow due process. If President Buhari pick am, di decision fit no go down well with politicians because e be di no fear or favour type.  E be di minister of education since di beginning of Buhari goment for 2015. E work with Buhari for plenti years and e be one of di few associates wey fit work straight to see im oga for di Presidential Villa.  Before im ministerial appointment, Malam Adamu na ogbonge writer. E dey always dey express im opinion concerning national and international issues. Di Kaduna State Governor Nasir el-Rufai dey presently suffer from Coronavirus - di  same disease wey kill Abba Kyari. Reports fly upandan say di governor don bin lobby to get di office last year, but no strong evidence to support dis report. Since afta Buhari form CPC, el-Rufai come be im close political ally and e get very big influence for Nigeria goment. If president Buhari pick am as some analyst dey suggest, e go be opportunity for am to make im presidential ambition for 2023 come true- dat na afta Buhari don complete im time for office. Even though some pipo dey see am as very controversial and dis fit affect im chance.","category":"nigeria","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/pidgin\/tori-52365012"}

{"headline":"Consent: Wetin e be and how you fit get am for lovey-lovey or kerewa","text":"Social media don dey buzz since pipo dey report plenti rape cases for online. Only last week, at least seven rape tori cause palava for different part of Nigeria and West Africa. Consent don become hot topic again and e be like say some pipo no sure wetin e mean or how dey fit ask am. No worry, BBC Pidgin follow 'Hands Off', an NGO wey dey teach pipo including children and teenagers wetin consent mean, tok on di matta.  According to Hands Off, consent na permission wey person suppose get before dem do something or begin to dey do something. Consent no be by force and person must give am freely and wen dem dey sober.  Di NGO add say person fit withdraw consent at any time wey dem like. If e be by force, e no be consent! Dem add say to say yes now, no mean say e don cover for future yes.  \"Also, e dey important to note say one fit consent to one act but not to consent to another. For example, one fit consent to hugs but make dem no consent to kisses and di oda party must to respect dia wishes. Pipo fit withdraw consent anytime, anyone fit withdraw consent and you no need reason to withdraw consent. No simply means no. Stop sef simply means stop.\" To get consent from anoda pesin simple but e must dey clear and pesin must ask before dem start to dey do do, na wetin Hands Off tok. Dem add say make pipo no dey assume consent and to dey respect wishes of di oda person \"even if you go like do am anoda way\". \"Everything way happun must to happun with knowledge and agreement wey di oda pesin freely give wen dem sober and force no dey involved\". Hand Off say di age of consent different from kontri to kontri. For Nigeria, anyone wey be 18 and above fit give consent. Small pikin or pesin wey never reach 18 no fit consent to sex.  \"Pikin wey dey sexual relation with adult na rape. Even if di pikin wan have sexual relation with di adult, na di duty of di adult to refuse. Wen di two pipo na pikin, two of dem must give consent. \"Pikin no fit give consent. In relationship wey get pikin and adult, di power wey dey no balance and na di role of di adult wey suppose know better to refuse and take that moment to educate di pikin on power difference and how e no dey okay for adult and pikin to have sexual relations.\" E dey important to dey check consent as di activities dey progress or dey change. To dey check for consent na wetin di pipo wey dey involve for di activities suppose dey ask, Hands Off tok.  \"To give consent for one sexual activity no mean to give consent for anoda type of sexual activity or more sexual activities. For example, agreeing to kiss someone no mean say you don gree make dem off your cloth or hug you. Agreeing to do oral sex no mean say you agree to sex by penetration. Agreeing for past no mean you gree for future. Consent no be one time thing. E dey always important to ask during sexual activities. You go say things like, \"I fit kiss you here?\", \"You dey okay wit dis?\" etc; beyond to dey ask wetin dem want, respecting dia wishes dey really important.\" Hands Off tok say pipo still need to ask sex workers for consent even if dem don pay for di sex. Dem add say e no mata if dem don pay for di sex, di oda party must to give consent freely. \"Dis entitlement to anoda pesin body and disrespect na why dem dey rape plenty sex workers. Sex workers fit consent to one activity wey dem pay for and no consent to another activity and one MUST always respect dia wishes.\" \"Remember, consent must dey free, without fear or force from anoda party. Dem must give am enthusiastically, assertive and clear. E must be free of threats and fear. E fit be withdrawn at any time and must be respected. \"Pipo get right to set boundaries about dia bodies, dia possessions, and dia actions, and we need to respect those boundaries. Consent no be blanket, e no fit cover everything, You fit consent to one activity, and dis no mean that you consent to everything else. Consent no fit be wen person dey sleep or drunk. Consent no fit be wen dem no fit make decisions by demsef.\"","category":"nigeria","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/pidgin\/tori-52996584"}

{"headline":"Oscars: Lionheart film chop disqualify for \"too much English\", see six oda Oscar don snub","text":"Di 2020 Oscars don already get im first controversy even before dem announce dia nominations. Dis na afta Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announce on Monday 4 November say dem don disqualify Lionheart, one Nigerian feem wey dem submit for di best international film category, sake of  \"say dem speak plenty English\" inside.  Di feem wey dey show for Netflix now, na di first-ever entry from di African kontri. But tori be say e break di Academy rule for international productions, wey say foreign contenders for di Oscars must get \"mainly non-English tok-tok\". Dis one mean dey must speak dia local language  more dan dem speak English. Lionheart na 95 minutes long and na only 11 minutes inside di whole feem wey dem no speak English. Dis decision pain some Nigerians well-well onto say di kontri official language na English - dat \"informate\" na wetin Lionheart director and actress, Genevieve Nnaji tok. She tweet say \"dis feem show how we dey tok as Nigerians,\" Dis include English, wey dey act as bridge between di ova 500 language dem wey we dey speak for our kontri.\"  \"We know choose who colonise us,\" na wetin she add put. Nigeria na former British colony for 160 years before e gain independence for 1960. But dis no be di first time wey dem don disqualify international feem before for di same reason. For 2015 dem say Afghanistan Utopia feem and Israel di Band Visit film for (2007) get \"too much English\" inside dem too. Or di first time wey di Academy don backtrack when it get to do with nominations or even awards. See di oda feem wey dem snub. Dem bin nominate Francis Ford Coppola mob feem for 11 categories for 1973 Oscars and dem win three awards- including best picture, best actor and best adapted screenplay. But dem lose out for di best soundtrack even before di ceremony start: dem withdraw di nomination afta di Academy find out say Nino Rota wey compose di music bin don use some music from im work for one Italian comedy for 1958. Di first ever Oscars ceremony for (1929) get controversy wey involve di great Charlie Chaplin. Im feem di Circus get four nominations, including best picture, best actor and best director- and dem bin expect  am to win all of dem. Instead, di Academy cancel di nominations and give Chaplin special honorary award. Dia official reason for dia decision na say di special award go recognise im importance for di film industry but tori be say film historians bin tok say di organisers no want Chaplin to clear everytin. Im no attend di ceremony. But Chaplin receive another honorary Oscar for 1972.  Dis na di first and only case for di history of Oscars wey dem carry statuette go. Young Americans, win di 1969 Oscar for best documentary na feem wey show journey of a show choir. But one week afta di ceremony dem cancel di award. Dia reason na say di feem dem bin show am for theatre for October 1967, wey disqualify for di 1968 season. High Society na popular musical feem wey dem do for 1957 and na Grace Kelly last work before she become princess of Monaco. Di Academy bin make mistake to nominate di members of di feem for best motion picture story, award wey dem dey give original movies. Di problem be say High Society no qualify as e dey based on one 1940 movie Di Philadelphia Story. 13 hours:  Di Secret Soldiers of Benghazi na 2016 action feem wey dey based on 2012 US Consulate attack for Libya city.  E no do well for box office and get one single Oscar nomination - for sound mixing. Tori be say Greg P Russell, one of the four members of the sound team, use im phone lobby to help secure di nomination, dis dey against di Academy rules - so dem remove im name from di nomination. To make matters work worse, 13 Hours lost to Mel Gibson's World War Two drama Hacksaw Ridge. A Place for di World, na Uruguay submission for 1993 Oscars, wey dem nominate for best international picture. But dem later cancel di nomination afta di Academy conclude say na Argentine feem.","category":"entertainment","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/pidgin\/tori-50306714"}

I no go forget am becos many pipo bin dey dia, di shop bin dey bubble,\" na so im wife tok.   As di demand for music by African artists begin grow, Tejuoso see am as duty to not just be pesin wey dey keep music but also as producer.

Dat na how we take start wit label.\" Despite say di iazz scene now dey different and dey exist side by side with more popular types of music, Tejuoso believes say room dey for Jazz to do well for dis market.  \"If jazz go get any future here, e go need to turn into our own language. We go need rework am into our DNA in a way.\" Artists and ogbonge pipo like Malian singer Salif Keita, Black Panther actors Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira and King Mohammed VI of Morocco don visit di store.

Headlines wey say Kim Jong-un dey \"seriously sick\", \"brain-dead\" or im dey \"recover from operation\" go always dey impossible to torchlight.  But di presidential office for Seoul don tok say no particular signs from di North to indicate say di 36-year-old dey \"seriously sick\".  Dis also no go be di first time rumour about im health go bring up plenty tok tok - only for dem to dismiss am later. Kim Jong-un recently miss di celebration of im grandpapa birthday on 15 April. Dis na one of di biggest events of di year, e dey mark di birth of di founder of di nation.  Kim Jong-un no ever don miss am - and very unlikely say e simply choose not to turn up.  As e be, im absence start di speculation and rumour, none of which dey easy to prove.  Kim Jong-un last appear for state media on 12 April as im \"inspect pursuit assault plane group\" for one handout wey no get date.   We know say im chair one key political meeting di day before, from state media despatches. But dem never see am since.

But later one sensational headline for US media comot say di North Korean leader dey in critical condition after heart surgery.  However, statement from South Korea goment, and sources for Chinese intelligence - for interview with Reuters news agency - say di tori no dey true.  E dey important to note say nobody don deny say Kim Jong-un undergo heart surgery.   Di statement from South Korea and China merely deny say di North Korean leader dey seriously sick.  For 2014, Kim Jong-un disappear for 40 days from early September - wey spark plenti speculation, wey include say oda political opposition don use coup comot am.  Den im re-appear for picture wia im hold cane.  State media dat time admit say im bin dey suffer from \"uncomfortable physical condition\", but dem no address rumours say im dey suffer from gout.  If anytin  happun to di North Korean leader, e no dey clear who go replace am.  Kim Jong-un papa prepare am to lead di kontri for many years. Di Kim dynasty look secure.  Kim sister, Kim Yo-jong, look like di clear choice. No be only say she come from di sacred \"Paektu blood line\", wey define di Kim dynasty, she done dey make more headlines of her own.  Last month she make her first public statement and she done dey make constant presence by her brother side for key summits.  But for now, we fit only watch and wait to see if North Korea react to dis many speculation about their leader health.  Di truth be say when e come to information about di North Korean leadership, many times we dey struggle to see road inside darkness.

As di mata be so, dis na seven tins wey you fit no know about Boko Haram wey don dey operate for Nigeria since 2009. For dia highest peak period for Nigeria between 2013-2015, Boko Haram branch out and enta Cameroon, Niger and Chad and begin dey cause kata-kat for those kontris.  Many pipo even dey tink say no be only Nigerians be members of Boko Haram members. In fact e do sotay, for 2015, Nigeria and dia neighbours Chad, Niger, Cameroon, Benin collabo to form di Multi-National Joint Task Force (MNJTF) say dem wan fight against Boko Haram.  Nigeria Defence Headquarters say na drug trades, money laudering from di international world na im dey fund di activities of Boko Haram plus including ransom from kidnappers. Na why dem ask international community, European Union to chook hand to find and block di pipo wey dey fund dis terrorist joinbodi. As at now di number of pipo Boko Haram don kill don pass thirty five thousand pipo and di group don comot ova 2-2 million pipo from dia houses all ova di Lake Chad region.

For sometime now, goment don tok say Boko Haram don dey divided among demsef and na wetin dem dey claim to dey commit di crimes even tho dem dey technically defeated. Some truth fit dey di division of Boko Haram, as afta Abubakar Shekau pledge alliance give di so called Islamic State, dem hand ova leadership of di Islamic State West Africa Province (Iswap) give Abu Musab al-Barnawi  in 2016. Dis come create two factions, di JAS wey dey Shekau control and anoda faction wey dey Iswap control. For 2015, Abubakar Shekau pledge allegiance to di so called Islamic State terrorist group come change di name of Boko Haram to Iswap. But for 2016, IS dump Shekau as dem name Abu Musab al-Barnawi di leader of di group wey cause Shekau to form im own group wey im call Jama'tu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad (JAS).  As time waka pass, di leadership of Iswap don change, and e dey create kwenta for di group. However, due to di fact say di group dey make social changes for di regions dem dey control, tori be say dem dey gain di loyalty of pipo dia. Abubakar Shekau take ova leadership of Boko Haram from Mohammed Yusuf for 2009 ehen Yusuf die for police custody. But from dat time till now, e don reach six times now wey authorities say e don die only for am to release video or audio to laugh at dem for face. Infact for 2013, after e comot to claim say e still dey di Nigerian military come out to say na imposter say im be Shekau. Anoda reason why Boko Haram start to trend na afta tori break say dem don rehabilitate and release 1400 suspected Boko Haram members inside Nigeria. Dis no go be di first time dis kain tin dey happun. For 2018, Nigeria military say dem bin release 244 former members wey dem de-radicalise say dem ready to ena society.

Dem find di conservative politician guilty of paying Penelope Fillon €1.156m (£1.06m, $1.3m) for work she no ever do as parliamentary aide. Fillon collect sentence of five years in prison, three of dem dey suspended. Meanwhile, Penelope collect three-year suspended term.  Di scandal bin ruin im presidential bid for 2017. Both of dem don appeal, dis wan block Fillon immediate detention.  Di 66-year-old na di most senior French political figure to receive jail sentence since di start of di Fifth Republic in 1958. Coronavirus masks block di couple dia expression as dem read di judgement out. Di presiding judge as im deliver di judgement for di Paris courthouse say: \"Di payment no align with di work done. Dem hire Mrs Fillon for position wey dey without use.\" Dem find her guilty of complicity to embezzle and hide  public funds. Both of dem chop fines of €375,000 ($423,000). In addition, court order di couple to return more dan €1m to di National Assembly, wey employ Penelope Fillon from 1998 to 2013. Dem also ban her husband from public office for 10 years. François and Penelope Fillon lawyers insist say di battle never dey lost, and say di appeal go be new and fairer trial. Dem get big arguments. First na say, di court of law no get place to determine wetin be work on behalf of politician. You or I fit find am corrupt say MP dey pay im wife to do wetin she go probably do anyway for free - but dat one no means say e dey illegal. And second - once dem tok am, di full story behind di former PM downfall go show di case in a different light. Di Fillon team don dey encouraged by claims from di former chief financial prosecutor say she bin dey \"pressure\" to speed up investigations ontop im head for early 2017.  E support dia view say di whole affair bin dey arranged to do di maximum possible damage. Even if dat were proven, though, e go dey necessary to affect di legal case against di Fillons. And dat- for now - deys very damning indeed. He don dey politics for decade now. Afta im serve as MP, senator, and for some ministerial roles, he become France prime minister between 2007 and 2012 under den-President Nicolas Sarkozy. Ahead of di 2017 presidential election, he win di centre-right Republican party presidential primary, and for January 2017 e be di clear front-runner for di polls. But im bid for di top job fall apart later dat month.  Le Canard Enchaîné, one satire magazine, allege say im wife -wey bin formally dey employed as im parliamentary assistant for about six years for di 1990s and 2000s - no ever actually do her job. On top dat, dem pay her €831,400 for di role. He deny di allegations. He say im opponents bin dey try to sabotage im campaign, and vow to press on with di election. As di scandal grow he bin apologise \"seriously\" for employing family members, im tok say though legal, di practice bin dey cause \"mistrust\". But im poll ratings drop sharply. He come third for di first round of voting, missing out on di second-round run-off.","category":"world","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/pidgin\/world-53225261"}

For Twitter, @maziobiehumadu say instead to increase VAT make goment cut down unnecessary expenditure.    While odas use funny funny memes take tok about di increment. Nigeria Finance Minister say one of di reasons why dem dey increase VAT na say state goment revenue dem don increase. Value Added Tax na special levy wey goment dey collect from consumers wey dey buy goods and services.  BBC Africa Business Reporter Kunle Falayi, break am down for us. First of all, make we remind ourselves say Nigeria get one of di lowest rates for VAT for di whole world. Kontries for Africa like Zambia dey collect 16 per cent, Kenya - 16 per cent, South Africa - 15 per cent, Ghana sef na 12.5 per cent. Oda kontries wey get lower VAT like Nigeria be Saudi Arabia - 5 per cent, Singapore 7 per cent, Thailand 7 per cent and United Arab Emirates - 5 per cent. Small as e small reach for Nigeria, dat one no mean say tins no go hard for everybody wen if goment increase VAT to 7.5 per cent. Make we check some indices like minimum wage and standard of living to explain. Make we even add dis oda kontries wey we don mention for up. Below na di way minimum wage be for di kontries: Nigeria - , $82 (N30,000\/month) Kenya - $130.86 (Ksh. 13,572\/month) South Africa - $240 (R 3,500\/month) Ghana - $58.11 (GH¢10.65\/day) Saudi Arabia - $607 (2,279 SAR \/month) Singapore - $839 (1,153 SGD \/month)  United Arab Emirates - $562 (2,066 AED per month) For poverty level, out of all dis kontries wey we don mention, na only Nigeria get poverty level (87 million people according to World Poverty Clock) wey almost reach half of di population.  In fact, no be all di state goment dem wey employ plenty people for Nigeria don gree to dey pay di N30,000 wey goment pass few months ago. E no get doubt say dis increment for VAT go lead to increase in di price of commodities. Make we also no forget say multiple taxes dey for oda goods and services for Nigeria wey dey different from VAT.  hBut di qweshion be say, Nigerians dey okay enough to carry di wahala wey go follow dis increment?","category":"nigeria","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/pidgin\/tori-49672536"}

Di reason wey di Nigeria Constitution give protection to president, vice president, govnor and deputy govnor na because di law no want make dem dey distracted by court wahala.  \"If e no dey like dat, dat office go dey face many-many court action and dat wan go dey against di constitution, \" na so di SAN tok.
