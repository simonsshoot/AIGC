{"Article Number": 1, "title": "CMV: People flocking to Rednote proves the Governments argument about the TikTok ban", "article": "Most people believe the reason the Federal Government banned TikTok was because of data collection, which is for sure part of it, but that's not the main reason it was banned. It was banned because of concerns that a foreign owned social media app, particularly one influenced directly by a foreign Government can manipulate US citizens into behaving in a way that benefits them.\n\nNo one knew what Rednote was 2 weeks ago in the US. All it took was a few well placed posts encouraging people to flock to a highly monitored highly censored app directly controlled by the CCP and suddenly an unknown app in the United States rocketed to the number 1 app in the country. \n\nThis is an app that frequently removes content mentioning LGBTQ rights, anything they view as immodest, and any discussion critizing the CCP- a party actively engaging in Genocide against the Uyghurs. Yet you have a flood of young people who just months ago decried the US's response to the Gazan crisis flocking to an app controlled by a government openly and unapologetically engaging in Genocide. \n\nThis was not an organic movement. If one is upset at the hamstringing of free speech their first reaction would not be to rush to an app that is controlled by a government that has some of the worst rankings of free speech globally. All it took was a few well placed posts on people's fyp saying \"Give the US the middle finger and join rednote! Show them we don't care!\"\n\n", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 3, "title": "CMV: Many standards of household tidiness are arbitrary, but failure to maintain them is viewed as some kind of deep shortcoming ", "article": "I'll start by saying that I'm not talking about things like leaving rotting food in the house for days on end/leaving dishes stacking up unwashed so nobody can use them - if cohabitors have issues with that, I see it as a more serious thing that has more justification for being upset. \n\nBut I see many examples of people judging each other for not living up to quite arbitrary standards of tidiness. I think this can especially become an issue in romantic relationships because of the closeness and the amount of time people spend together, but it's not exclusive to those. \n\nI mean things like not vacuuming the floor with a certain regularity (once a week, twice a month or however often), leaving clothing on the floor instead of in some kind of laundry hamper, leaving objects on surfaces instead of in the cupboard etc. In my view, these things are almost always arbitrary matters of preference, and being upset about them is a purely emotional reaction that can't be justified in an objective way. But I see lots of examples online of people complaining that they are forced to 'mother'* their partners by teaching them to tidy these things up and put them in their 'proper' place, otherwise the partners would just continue to leave them on the floor or on the side - not considering that maybe there isn't an objective standard to these things, the two of them have different preferences, and the objective should actually be to see whether compromise is possible, rather than bullying their partner into changing their behaviour to keep things the way they want them. \n\n*(I realise this language is gendered but I think it can apply in any direction gender-wise). \n\nI don't think this means that less tidy cohabitors should put in no effort at all - I think any living situation will end up being some sort of compromise, and if you love and respect someone it's nice to make some kind of effort to help them have their space the way they want it. But I don't think it's usually framed this way; I more often see it framed as 'cohabitor 1 is failing to live up to proper standards and cohabitor 2 is forced to do a load of work to make things acceptable'. \n\nVacuuming is a good example; my friend 'Dan' lived alone for a long time, never vacuumed at all, and never experienced any problems (no moths, no mould etc.). When his partner 'Will' moved in and vacuumed the floor for the first time, Dan didn't notice he'd done it until it was pointed out to him, and even then it didn't look very different to him. If Will wants the floor to be vacuumed once a week, I can see that Dan should certainly make some effort to vacuum it sometimes - but this is a favour to Will that Dan doesn't benefit from (because he doesn't notice or care if the floor is vacuumed), and it should be treated as such, rather than just as common decency that he should have to do without being asked all the time. \n\nI personally would rather have my clothes just on the floor in one corner of the room than have a load of cupboards and laundry hampers taking up floor space in a way that's difficult to rearrange. Living in a room with wardrobes and cupboards around every wall would make me actively less happy - I might do it for a partner, but it should be viewed as a sacrifice of my own wants, rather than a matter of basic decency. \n\nI'm posting this here because I know many people disagree with me so I may be missing something - would love to hear other people's perspectives!

{"Article Number": 5, "title": "CMV: American society is decaying ", "article": "My fundamental argument is that the social and creative fabric of America is or already has unraveled, causing social decay. A lot of us have picked up the elements of this decline in our daily lives. We are less social, more isolated, more detached from the pure ideological and alienated from our labor and its products. As well, dating culture, party culture, and whichever other social culture you can think of has become far less rewarding or outright grueling. This, I argue, is our society in the US decaying such that we are declining as a cohesive and functioning civilization. \n\nThere are numerous reasons for this but I want to focus on what I think is one of the principal catalysts and one of the prime nexuses: how America uses and understands space. Following WW2, the United States fully committed to suburbia and the automobile not just as a way of life but as the quintessential American life. The product of this conscious self-segregation was twofold, 10,000 years of how humans organize and socialize in their lived environments was completely upended and the overwhelming majority of American cities were razed to the ground and towns hollowed out. (If you want examples google almost any American city pre-war and then today, it’ll make you cry). This was so damaging because, as animals, humans are deeply social, creative, and laborious. We want and need robust social communities and we want and need to work our bodies and minds. The shift of American society towards the automobile and suburbia has made us immobile, isolated, anti-social, and detached from feeling a part of society. As this dynamic has grown worse and worse, it has facilitated our isolation, physically distancing us from other people, from commerce, and from community. \n\nThis dynamic of prioritizing single family detached homes (it’s illegal to build anything else in 70% of the country) and separating work, commerce, and culture (theaters, music venues, museums, etc) from the home such that one must drive to go to anything detaches us not merely from those aspects of life but conditions us to view them as distinctly separate from our home and community.   This is directly responsible, in part or in whole, for many problems we face today such as our housing crisis, political division, and wealth inequality as it facilitates the circumstances necessary for these issues to occur and worsen.

As far as I know the protesting mods got nothing out of this. \n\nIMO this was predictable. There is a _demand_ for a forum like Reddit. The blackouts did nothing to satisfy the demand. As a redditor, I postponed a few threads that I had wanted to post, but when it became clear that things were returning to normal, I posted the discussions and questions I had in mind. \n\nThe best way the protesting mods could have hoped to make a change would have been to _pitch an alternative to Reddit_. That way, some Redditors might be willing to switch and abandon Reddit, which would hurt Reddit-the-company and give the protesters some leverage. They didn't all need to suggest the _same_ alternative, but preferably it should be as convenient as possible, to encourage as many redditors as possible to emigrate. As long as the demand remained, and there was no good alternative, users were bound to return to Reddit. \n\nAs far as I know, there are no really good alternatives to Reddit in general. There are sites that can replace Reddit for _some_ specific purposes, such as Quora and Stack Exchange, but those are much less general. There also exist old-fashioned fora, but few of them have a level of activity that can compete with a decent subreddit. The best option for a general alternative is Facebook groups, and that is worse than Reddit in a lot of ways IMO.\n\nBut with enough community support, an alternative to Reddit could be viable. That time with the blackouts was a great opportunity to pitch such an alternative. Sadly, the protesters did not.\n", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 9, "title": "CMV: \"Hope\" is a more valuable construct of the human condition than \"Faith\" is. ", "article": "Okay, so...I did some light research before making this post so that I can toss it up here in CMV. I needed to be sure I understood the meanings of the words \"Hope\" and \"Faith\". \n\nTo start, my motto is: Don't have 'Faith', have 'Hope' instead, because Faith places the responsibility on something/someone else, whereas Hope places the accountability solely on yourself.\n\nThat said, after doing my light research, I fear I may have misunderstood the meanings of either/both of the meanings of them. \n\nDefinition of Faith(Of what I read): To believe something is true, and to commit solely to that belief.\n\nDefinition of Hope(Again, of what I read): To desire, or have longing for someone/something.\n\nI do not know if this is an apples-to-oranges comparison, and realistically, emotions are quite fickle in, and of themselves. So, I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case.\n\nAnywho, allow me to elaborate on my perspective:\n\nFor the sake of clarity, I'm going to use a common example: Religion. That's not implying that either of these terms are limited solely to that topic, it's simply to convey what I mean when I speak of them.\n\nHere we go...\n\nFaith, in the case of religion, is to place the responsibility/accountability of this chaotic and random reality upon an immaterial, omnipotent force...God.\n\n\"I must have faith in the fact that God only ever does what is best for me, so regardless of what may come, pushing through the process, and learning from the experience is, by definition meeting God's expectations of me.\"\n\nThis is how I view faith to the best of my ability.\n\nHope, on the other hand, doesn't require some outside force. It requires only yourself. I have hope in myself, to have the ability to push through an experience, therefore...surviving said experience reinforces my ability to trust in myself. And thus, I have no need to rely on outside forces, and only have need to rely on myself.\n\nI prefer hope for a few reasons:\n\n1. I don't like leaving things up in the air for someone else to grab and solve for me. I struggle with codependency on a grand scale, and feel that this understanding is better suited for my needs.\n\n2. I am impartial to the motive forces of the universe. I cannot prove if there is some intelligence behind it. Therefore, I should not waste energy on trying to do so.\n\n3. Even if there are motive forces for the universe, that does not mean it has to be a conscious force. It's something we experience a lot, and on the daily, that things just fucking *happen*, and all you can do is react. How you react is probably a separate conversation entirely, but hey, I'm open suggestion if someone can reasonably tie it into the discussion. \n\n4. I believe it is a dogma that the universe seeks to observe itself. It's blatantly clear that science has proven photons can change themselves based on whether they are \"observed\". This, in no way, implies that there is a conscious force, but rather there is simply a reaction to stimuli from another source: Us observing/measuring the focus. To put it plainly, bacteria, and germs, in general do not \"think\" they simply \"are\", and their reactions are based on outside stimuli, or rather, their environment.\n\nAlright, I think that's as good as I can put it.

It is worse.", "article": "\n(To my knowledge, none of the below-stated facts are controversial. But I will be happy to be educated).\n\n\n\nA few points of comparison:\n\n\n\n**1.Absolute numbers:**\n\nRoughly 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from Israel during the 1948 war.\n\nRoughly 1,000,000 Jews fled or were expelled from the Arab world plus Iran and Turkey in the decades that followed.\n\nAdditionally, between 30,000 to 90,000 Palestinian refugees managed to return to Israel before it could enforce effective border control. To my knowledge, few or no Jews ever returned to Arab/Muslim countries.\n\n**2. Relative numbers:**\n\nThe Palestinian population in Israel was reduced by around 80% because of the Palestinian Nakba.\n\nThe Jewish population in most Arab/Muslim countries was reduced by 99% or even 100%.\n\nThis is significant because there still exists a vibrant (if oppressed) Palestinian society inside Israel, while the Jewish communities throughout the Arab world (some of them ancient) were completely and permanently obliterated, something not even the Holocaust could do. There are more Jews today living in Poland than in the entire Arab world.\n\n\n\n**3. Causes:**\n\nThere's no doubt that the Zionists took advantage of the chaos of the 1948 war to reduce the Palestinian population as much as possible. There's also no doubt that there would have been hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees even if the Zionists *were actively trying* to make them stay. Every war in the history of the planet has caused massive refugee crises, and the blame for them usually falls on whoever started the war. It should be noted that there were also tens of thousands of Jewish refugees fleeing the war in the opposite direction, from Gaza and Hebron and Jerusalem into Israel. Again, not a single Jew was allowed to remain in the Arab-controlled territories of Palestine after the war.\n\n\n\nThe Jewish exodus from Arab countries took place in peacetime. Many Jews immigrated willingly for ideological reasons, but there were also numerous pogroms, expulsions, and various state policies to make life impossible for Jews. All of this could have been easily avoided, if the Arab governments weren't pursuing an active policy of ethnic cleansing. To this day, Jewish presence is either barely tolerated in Arab society, or tolerated not at all. The most extreme Israeli Arab-hater doesn't hold a candle to the Nazi-style antisemitic propaganda regularly consumed and believed in mainstream Arab media.\n\n\n\nIn short, the 1948 war saw expulsions/flight on both sides, sometimes unintentional, sometimes justified by military necessity, sometimes deliberate ethnic cleansing. Like every war in history.\n\n\n\nThe subsequent decades-long Jewish expulsion from Arab countries was just pure ethnic cleansing.\n\n\n\n**4. Reparations:**\n\n\n\nThe Palestinian refugee population has received more international aid per capita than any other refugee population in history. Israel has also, in various peace negotiations since 1949, offered to allow some of the refugees to return and to pay out compensation for others.\n\n\n\nAs far as I know, no reparations or international aid of any kind was paid for the amelioration of the situation of Jewish refugees from Arab countries, and the issue was not even mentioned seriously in any peace negotiations.\n\nDelta edit: this point is only relevant insofar as Israel is held accountable for the continued disenfranchisement of the descendants of Palestinian refugees in their host countries. If we correctly discuss this issue separately, this point is not relevant.\n\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\n\nEven to bring up the Palestinian Nakba without a much heavier focus on the Jewish expulsions is to expose oneself as not interested in facts, or human rights, or correcting historical injustices.\n\n\n\nChange my view.\n\n\n\n\n\n** Important edit **\n\n\nI would like to clarify something about the conclusion. It is, of course, valid for anyone to talk about anything they like and to not talk about anything they like. However, talking about the Nakba without mentioning the Jewish expulsions is bad for the following reasons:\n\n1.\t⁠The people who are loudest about the Nakba are often the same people who outright deny the Jewish expulsions.\n\n2.\t⁠In certain contexts, such as summarizing historical grievances and crimes of the Israeli-Arab conflict, or of making specific political demands for the resolution of the conflict, it would be racist and hypocritical to mention only one of these two events.\n\n3.\t⁠The Nakba, in particular, is often cited as the reason to delegitimize the state of Israel and claim that it should be dismantled, and that any dealings with Israel makes one complicit in the crime of the Nakba. If one is to be morally consistent, they must also apply the same standard to Egypt, Syria, Iran, Yemen, etc. The fact that they don’t indicates that they do not truly believe that an act of ethnic cleansing makes a country illegitimate.\n", "authorship": "human"}

The fact it sits right in the middle between the USA and Russia and China could provide the US military with interesting possibilities in controlling maritime trade, for example increasing the ability to enforce possible embargoes and therefore increasing America´s influence and power even more.

Falsely representing a culture, and thereby spreading a false image of a culture. I can understand that spreading false information about a culture &amp; people (e.g. by altering a culture's folklore and passing it off as the original) is problematic (even if perhaps not immediately harmful). However, if people aren't going to take your use of the culture as a representation of a culture, or else if your representation is accurate, then this shouldn't be an issue.\n3. Taking their culture and claiming credit for it. Like with passing someone else's art or invention off as your own and reaping the rewards for it, I can see that there could be issues with taking something from someone else culture and claiming the credits and rewards for it without any acknowledgement.

I realize that plus or minus a month makes little difference in the overall timeline of most research, but that's no reason to just accept the inefficiency, and if one paper builds on another, that delay compounds.\n\nMy thinking is that if you can't find ~8 hours or so (the time commitment suggested by AGU's how-to-do-peer-review article) - total, not all at once - in the next month, you're not going to reliably find it within any time frame.  Unless the upcoming month is exceptionally busy, in which case you probably shouldn't accept a review request.  Otherwise, it seems more likely to be a case of \"tasks expand to occupy the available time\", particularly for something that's (quite reasonably) a lower priority than the reviewer's own work.  But I'm also very new to actually doing the reviewing, so I may be missing something.\n\nSo, why does a peer review [in the sciences] need to take more than a month?\n\nEdit: view changed on multiple fronts.\n\n1. Given other time commitments in academia, at least some folks wouldn't accept a review request on such a short deadline, so it would be self-defeating.\n2. \"Science\" was insufficiently narrow; other fields than mine within the sciences may require considerably more time for a thorough review.\n3. In very small areas of research, it's necessary to make things workable for a tiny pool of eligible reviewers.", "authorship": "human"}

Before anybody asks, the point of this post isn’t “why can’t we all be nice to each other?,” I genuinely feel the chasm between right and left in the United States cannot be bridged; both sides are on completely different teams, and they, especially the left, would rather see America destroyed than the other team be successful.\n\nThe front page of reddit is currently chock-full of threads calling Republicans “heartless” and “inhuman” for their response to the California fire, which is fair enough. However, it hasn’t been lost on me that these are the same people who were just a few months ago filling comment sections about the Panhandle fires and the Florida hurricanes with comments to the tune of “Serves those inbred Trumptards right!” They expect compassion and sympathy, but they have none to give.\n\nMy argument is that both sides of the political spectrum, especially the left, now view the opposition not as dissidents, but as inferiors; a defective, detestable cancer worthy of hatred and scorn, and deserving of suffering. I truly believe that the United States is not salvageable.\n\nThat said, I am open to changing this view.

In fact it might even improve society as a whole.", "article": "Okay, people have the argument to why legalizing murder is bad and well the argument boils down into the fact that it would collaspe society. Well, I have a counter to that. It will improve society and it won't even collapse it.\n\nFirstly, legalizing murder would mean that everyone would have a reason not to antagonise one another. We all have issues with someone in life, ranging for a coworker to even our insurance company. With murder being legal, there will be an incentive for people in the society not to antagonize one another as they can be killed for any reason, resulting in a more peaceful society. This is a reason why it won't collapse society at all if murder was legalized.\n\nSecondly, it can drive up efficiency in services such as insurance companies and government related services. If people are allowed to go open season and kill government workers (including holders of political office) and company CEOs for any reason at all, they will have a reason not to slack off on approval of services or any other work they do as they don't want to be next in line. This helps improve efficency in services. Manpower issues? Well press gang those with remotely related skills to the qualifications of the jobs to take their place.\n\nBut what about a psychopath who would take advantage of the laws? Well, he or she is open season, meaning as soon as he or she makes their move, others will.\n\nI think that legalizing murder would actually not result in the collapse of society and might actually even improve it.", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 25, "title": "CMV: Micah Bell from Red Dead Redemption 2 is not as bad as the fandom makes him out to be", "article": "\nYes you read that right I throughly believe that Micah Bell from the game Red Dead 2 is not as bad as he is made out to be by the fandom. Now I’m not going to deny all of Micah’s poor qualities. Micah Bell is a racist, misogynistic, bullying, cold blooded outlaw those qualities cannot be ignored. \n\nBut if we are going to be real here is Micah any worse than the gang. At least everyone with the exception of few of the girls have killed people they are no different from Micah. Micah is also the only one in the entire gang who doesn’t pretend to have a Robin Hood/Saviour Complex that the gang has to justify his bad actions and that’s something I actually respect about Micah. Micah knows that he is an awful person and embraces to Outlaw life without any qualms so he doesn’t pretend to fill noble unlike the rest of the gang when they’re just a pile of scumbags. Micah as cruel as the man was in the game was the cold and harsh reality of the Wild West, while the gang were whitewashed and romanticised versions of the Wild West. \n\nPeople talk about Micah tends to bully people at the camp this true but if we are going to be real they gang are just assholes to him as much as he is an asshole to them. For example in the beginning Lenny cruelly mocked how if Micah was to die they would be party. Now in Lenny defense it could argued that it was a comeback when Micah complained of having to sleep with the darkies. Again on one camp encounter Micah was literally minding who own business not even bothering anyone then all of a sudden Sean just walks up to him, telling him that when he was about to get hanged he wouldn’t miss Micah. Finally the player who has control of Micah has the option to be a dick to Micah by constantly antagonising him even when Micah wasn’t hurting anyone. While Micah has his fair share of being a bad person to the gang the gang also are pricks to him, so there is nuance in the feud. \n\nAs mentioned before he is a racist for example he racially abused Lenny more than once by saying ‘he’s killed people like him’. Or when he called Charles an African American/Native male a redskin. In addition to this Micah told Javier to fuck off back to Mexico. I am a black man who played the game so I think I give my viewpoints for Micah’s racism towards Lenny and Charles. In my honest opinion Micah was solely racist just to be spiteful, his racism is the equivalent of those racist kids on Xbox live called people the N-Words, I don’t like his racism but his isn’t too bad. \n\nThey are even worse racists in the game like Micah who took it to a whole another level. Example A being the KKK who lynch black people, Leviticus Cornwall and Colonel Favours racist imperialist capitalists white men who worked together to expel the Waipiti Native Americans from their land. Hell even Colonel Favours disrespected Rains Fall as when Rains Fall addressed himself as chief Colonel Favours responded by saying he can’t say that silly name. In Saint Denis there is a literal racist who wholly believes in his bullshit and spouts how the white race is superior. In Rhodes there’s a man on a bench called Jeremiah Compson asks Arthur’s help to retrieve a few items from his home as the law seized his house. Arthur later learn that Compson was actually slave catcher and got paid for it. Bill is also a racist in the game referring to Lenny as ‘boy’ which is a racial undertone for black men and called native Americans as savages, but I don’t see Bill catching much shit for this by the fandom. This point may be ‘whataboutism’ but it does highlight how there are racists who take it to a whole other level. \n\nMicah harasses the woman in the camp for instance he constantly hits on Abigail proclaiming that he can be a better man for her and a better father for John. He is also mean to the woman as well when conversing with Miss Grimshaw he actually was having a great chat with her before he insulted the hard working woman. \n\nVarious people also bring up one of their reasons for disdain for Micah is the massacre of Strawberry. Let me say what Micah did was wrong but to be frank Micah and Arthur didn’t kill many civilians. Yes Micah did kill an innocent couple but the majority of the people Micah and Arthur fought were lawmen who were trying to stop them. \n\nI don’t think that Micah 100% all bad there are many instances where he tried to get along with the gang. Even tho the two had an intense rivalry I think Micah genuinely tried to befriend Arthur in the beginning but of course Arthur shut down every opportunity, in defense of Arthur tho he found Micah to be too reckless but that’s one of many of Micah’s bad qualities. As token gift Micah even gave Arthur the awesome Lancaster Repeater. Right after that Micah and Arthur get along and joke about the fact the two have no problems killing O Driscolls probably the only time Micah and Arthur had a genuine feel good moment. Micah was even happy to see Arthur alive the Guarma arc with Dutch, Bill and Javier. Another time when Micah tried to be friendly was in a camp encounter he will ask Mary-Beth to a dance nervously. Mary-Beth rejected Micah and I think it was hands down a true genuine moment where Micah longed for companionship. In addition to this at the camp Micah and Javier will get drunk, both character will have a great time sharing stories and laughing. Micah even went with Lenny to befriend him and the two go out drinking when scouting in Strawberry. All those moments humanise Micah as he isn’t all bad he may be an asshole but he still has his times where he tries to connect with others. \n\nPersonally I feel really bad for Micah along with everybody else with the camp. I believe that he is second most tragic in the gang just behind Arthur Morgan. While the gang have their tragedies Micah’s is a whole different level. Micah was raised to be a cruel person by his father. He taught to be ruthless, aggressive and violent towards others. Micah only knew the philosophy of survival of the fittest from his father, and I could only imagine what type of horrors Micah has experienced. Micah even had a heart to heart moment with the gang explaining this to them and his philosophy that there’s only winners and losers. We eventually learn Micah had a brother. We may never know what he wrote to Micah but Micah’s brother Amos rejected Micah telling him to stay away. Maybe it was a last ditch attempt to connect with his brother maybe it wasn’t we will never know.\n\nThe ultimate reason why people hate Micah tho is due to the fact he ratted on the gang I can understand that but here’s my opinion on it. Micah ratted on the gang because of his survival philosophy as he proclaimed to Arthur during his father. I think Micah didn’t rat until they got back from Guarma and the Pinkertons came to him not the other way around. I also think he betrayed the gang due to the fact not a single person in the camp liked him, it’s basically the case of why be loyal to a family that never cared about you. \n\nI also find Micah Bell to be an absolute badass. In Rhodes when Sean got shot by the Grays snipers, Micah quickly took out three guys one of them being Sean’s killer. Together Micah and Arthur were able to sweep Rhodes of all the Grays assassins, and managed to rescue Bill who was being held hostage by them. Even tho the two hated each other’s guts Micah and Arthur were a dangerous duo \n\nIn this subreddit you are automatically supposed to hate Micah Bell. Because I have stated the opposite and expressed myself being fond of the character this post will get downvoted. But I’m ready for the downvotes I have said my piece. \n", "authorship": "human"}

Thank you to all the comments so far!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nStarting off with some disclaimers and definitions:\n\n* I am NOT bashing people who got pregnant and didn't mean to.

That's 99.98% of people who won't get pregnant.\n\nThat's with perfect use. If we assume a [more conservative \"typical\" use](https://www.drugs.com/medical-answers/birth-control-failure-rates-pearl-index-explained-3554953/), the number becomes closer to (1-0.87) \\* (1-0.93) = .0091 = 0.91%. Still less than a 1% chance of pregnancy.\n\nYou can mix and match the numbers with slightly different rates of different contraceptives from different sources online, but the result remains the same: **if two consenting adults who are actively trying not to get pregnant use two forms of contraceptive, they are incredibly unlikely to get pregnant.**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI understand that there is the 1/5000 couple who did everything absolutely right, and got unlucky. This post is not about them (\"virtually all\", not \"all\"), and I sympathize to those situations.\n\nHowever, for the majority of couples who accidentally got pregnant, it simply comes down to a lack of education and knowing what to do. If this applies to you or a loved one, please know that I am not intending to invalidate your experience, shame you, or make any comment on your intelligence. The system has been designed to fail, and you were a victim.\n\nAt the risk of leaning on anecdotal evidence, the amount of sexual education knowledge I've learned online in my adulthood, mostly by happenstance, has been staggering. I asked around my peers and many of them didn't know what [contraceptive failure rates actually represent](https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-do-you-interpret-birth-control-failure-rates-906657), or that [if you put a condom on wrong, you're supposed to throw it away](https://www.brook.org.uk/your-life/condoms-common-mistakes/), or that [Plan B has several exceptions that reduce its effectiveness](https://yalehealth.yale.edu/topic/emergency-contraception-morning-after-pill). I certainly didn't. And if I can be the first one to tell you this: [porn isn't like real life](https://panthernow.com/2018/02/14/pornography-constructs-false-reality-sex).\n\nI didn't know some of these things. Not because I'm some foolish dummy, but because **I didn't know what I didn't know**, and no one ever taught me.\n\nOnly [30 of the 50 states require sex education](https://siecus.org/siecus-state-profiles/) to be taught in schools. That's 60% of states. Pitiful.\n\n[Teen birthrates in the U.S. are lower than ever](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/number-pre-teen-moms-us-record-low-cdc/story?id=54720089), but[ the amount of unwanted pregnancies in America overall is around a staggering 40%](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductive-health/hcp/unintended-pregnancy/index.html). Going back to the numbers from above, it is impossible to say that all these couples did everything they could do to prevent the pregnancy. Again, this isn't because they didn't try their hardest, but because they didn't know what could be done.\n\nMore and more states are interested in banning abortions. In a crazy coincidence, [the states that are restricting or banning abortion are the same states that don't have good sex ed programs](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/graphic-many-states-that-restrict-or-ban-abortion-dont-teach-kids-about-sex-and-pregnancy/).\n\nI hope it doesn't need to be argued, that no one should prefer to use abortion as a form of contraceptive (and if you do prefer this, please go get some help). But [women who have abortions overwhelmingly stand by their decision to do so](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/01/416421/five-years-after-abortion-nearly-all-women-say-it-was-right-decision-study). This deeply personal decision can leave psychological wounds that never heal, and it can almost always be prevented with better sexual education earlier on.\n\nThere are those of you reading this who never would consider doubling up on contraceptives, and that's fine. Hormonal birth control can fuck up your body, and it's not as though the alternatives are that much better. I feel for the ladies out there who don't have great options or great access to birth control. It's not fair for any of us to judge you on your bodily preference, and it's not fair to say you can't also be sexually active. Just please don't ever trust a man who says he can't or won't use a condom, and be as safe as you can.\n\nIf you're a guy who doesn't like condoms and doesn't want kids: hopefully you know the risks.\n\nThere are those of you who know the risks and simply don't care, and this post isn't for you. I feel sympathy for your partner, and pity your recklessness.\n\nIf you are a parent, have an uncomfortable talk with your teenager. If you are a teenager, please educate yourself before accepting the risks of pregnancy. If you are like me and didn't know some of this until your twenties, stay safe out there. This post is not exhaustive, and I'd encourage anyone to do their own research. [No one benefits from an unwanted pregnancy.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4449999/)\n\nIn summary: **it's incredibly unlikely to get pregnant if you know how to prevent it (EDIT: and want to prevent it).** This is sadly not taught ubiquitously at a young age, so you have to hold yourself accountable if you want to stay child-free for now.\n\nChange my view?", "authorship": "human"}

It also provides a moral framework and for implementing the large-scale changes that would be required for a collective alternative to capitalism.\n\nWithout any form of national identity people would have no reason to sacrifice for the good of unknowable others. Fractionalisation among ethnic, religious or cultural lines would form and those competing interests would become too prevalent for a state to achieve collectivised success.  \n\nIn a global world it would be very difficult to convince those with crucial skills to stay for the collective benefit of the nation. Those with specialised skills or an ability to conceptualise and implement new technologies will always be rewarded more financially under capitalism. Therefore, any alternative to capitalism would need those sorts of people to stay otherwise it would fall behind the rest of the world and inevitably that would lead to failure. Without the ideal of a nation state, it is less likely these people would turn down personal wealth for collective benefit.\n\nSome examples of current left wing or collectivised states.

{"Article Number": 38, "title": "cmv: Eating dogs or cats is not bad.", "article": "A lot of people, especially in Western countries, completely overreact when they see others eating dogs or cats. They will call it cruel or inhumane, but honestly, it is just hypocritical. Every country has its own culture and ideas about what animals are pets and what animals are food. Acting like one way is the only right way is not just ignorant, it is also kind of racist.\n\nIn Western culture, dogs and cats are treated like family. People spend ridiculous amounts of money on them, buying them special toys, fancy food, and even putting them in clothes. That is totally fine, but it does not mean that everyone else has to do the same. In countries like China or Vietnam, dogs and cats are often just seen as animals, the same way cows or chickens are in the West. They eat them because it is normal there, part of their culture, and often one of the more affordable food options.\n\nThe thing is, there is no logical difference between a dog and, say, a pig or a cow. Pigs, for example, are incredibly intelligent, and some scientists even say they are smarter than dogs. But people in the West are perfectly fine eating bacon or a pork chop without thinking twice. It is just cultural bias that makes one animal “acceptable” to eat and another one off-limits.\n\nWhat makes this even more frustrating is how little people in the West actually think about where their own food comes from. The conditions in factory farms are absolutely horrible. Chickens are crammed into tiny cages, cows live in filthy spaces, and pigs go through unimaginable suffering before they are killed. But because that is “normal” in the West, people just ignore it. Yet, they will get outraged when they see a dog meat market in another country. It is completely hypocritical.\n\nAnd let us not forget that Western countries did not always treat dogs the way they do now. Just a few hundred years ago, dogs were mostly seen as working animals. They guarded farms or helped with hunting. The whole idea of treating them as pets and spoiling them is actually pretty recent. So, acting like eating dogs is some kind of ancient moral crime makes no sense.\n\nThis outrage also has a strong undertone of cultural superiority. Western countries have a history of judging others for not living “the right way.” Seeing something unfamiliar, like eating dogs, and calling it barbaric without trying to understand it is just another example of that. It is like ignoring how eating beef in India, where cows are sacred, could seem just as offensive to people there.\n\nAt the end of the day, what people eat is part of their culture. What is normal in one place might seem strange somewhere else, but that does not make it wrong. If people really care about animal welfare, they should focus on fixing the terrible conditions in factory farms worldwide instead of shaming others for eating certain animals.\n\nSo maybe it is time to stop pretending that Western values are the only ones that matter. The world is full of different cultures, and we do not all have to live by the same rules.\n\n", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 41, "title": "CMV: For straight married couples, you shouldn't have friends of the opposite sex.", "article": "I've made a few comments on Reddit previously that get downvoted a lot because of my position on this. That makes me believe that maybe I should change my position.\n\nWhen you're a straight individual and are married, you should not have friends of the opposite sex. The number one reason for my position on this is affairs. **Time and time again, people fall into affairs because there's a small fracture in their marriage and a friend fills the void.** It usually starts innocent enough - meaning, people don't plan to have the affair. It's simply a friendship. But for a few of reasons, it turns into something more.\n\n1. **You trust the friend.** This often leads to sharing private information about your marriage with them and often leads to asking for advice about your marriage. This begins the slippery slope of bonding over a situation where the friend genuinely wants to help you, and you need their emotional support.\n2. **The friend likely knows or has met your spouse.** Similar to the point above, this is comforting for you because the friend will better understand the problems you are having in your marriage because they are familiar with your spouse.\n3. **Your spouse is comfortable with you talking to this person already.** This allows communication to happen 'in plain sight', because the foundation has been laid that you and the friend are allowed to communicate, with or without the spouse present. Even when communications become 'more than friendly', you feel less guilt because your spouse knows that you're 'just friends' with this person. It reinforces the justifications you are already having to make about the emotional connection you share with this friend that has gone beyond that of a friendship.\n4. **The negative information you're giving the friend about your spouse encourages the friend to do/say the opposite of your spouse, making them appear better suited for you and you start to compare your friend and the spouse with each other.** I'm not sure if there's a technical name for this phenomenon, but in short, you're giving the friend a cheat code for how to be a better partner for you than your spouse. For instance, you say, \"Every time I try to talk to my spouse, he hijacks my story and makes it about himself and never tells me he understands.\" The friend promptly responds with \"I understand, that must be really hard for you.\" Now, it's a great response by the friend, but also an opportunity to continue to drive a wedge between you and your spouse with the information that *you* provided. The friend feels needed and appreciated, you feel understand and heard, and again - the relationship continues to develop into something far beyond a friendship. This isn't based on a real connection, but rather opportunistic behaviors by the friend who is now attached and leverages the information you've provided them to develop a deeper connection with you. \n5. **The relationship with the friend is easier to maintain that the marriage; no bills/money to argue over, no children to interfere - just an emotional connection that may develop into something sexual over time.** As mentioned in the previous point, nothing about this is more 'real' than your marriage - in fact, it's everything but. But your once friend now has a halo on and you're fantasizing about running away together to escape your marriage problems with the person you made your vows to.\n\nThe above points show why this happens even when you didn't plan on it, and why it continues even after you realize it's happening. Being friends with the opposite sex during a marriage may be well intended but often ends up as something more than you planned. \n\nChange my view that straight couples shouldn't have friends of the opposite sex.", "authorship": "human"}

If we ban it, what happens to all the small businesses that rely on it? What happens to the millions of creators who’ve turned TikTok into their livelihood?\n\nAnd what about the message this sends to the world?

This is the principle of maximizing existence through the multiplication of contacts and relationships, the intensive use of consumer objects, and the systematic exploitation of all potential gains.  \nThe consumer does not question whether he should escape this compulsion. This new individual spends less and less time on production within the framework of their work and increasingly focuses on the production and constant innovation of their needs and well-being. They must ensure that all their possibilities and consumptive capacities are continuously mobilized.  \n\"Try Jesus,\" says an American slogan. Everything must be tried: the consumer-driven individual is haunted by the fear of missing out on some kind of experience or pleasure. You never know if a particular contact, this or that experience (Christmas in the Canary Islands, eel with whiskey, the Prado Museum, LSD, Japanese-style lovemaking) might hold a \"sensation\" in store for you.  \nThis is no longer about desire, taste, or specific preferences, but about a generalized curiosity transformed into a diffuse restlessness: this is \"fun morality,\" or the imperative to have fun and thoroughly exploit all possibilities—the imperative to enjoy, reward oneself, and get in the mood.\n\nAs a minimalist, I've always consider myself 'above' the simple consumer.

Consumerism itself provides a ready-made answer: the purpose is the consumption itself.  \n\nEveryone is so deeply embedded in our consumer society, you cannot run away from it. Baudrillard would say that there is no 'outside' of the system. The consumer society is inescapable.

They've been investigated by congress, and there's other proposed lawsuits being brought against them, but all these things seem fundamentally misguided to me.\n\nAll land and homes have some value based on the supply of parcels and units available and the demand for those parcels. The goal of tenants is to get a unit that meets their needs as cheaply as possible, and the goal of landlords is to rent out those units to suitable tenants for as much as possible. Having better information about what the market looks like helps landlords make better decisions about what to ask for, but it doesn't actually move those supply and demand curves around. It's a price discovery mechanism, not a price setting mechanism.\n\nIt's not price fixing even if two (or three, or any number) separate landlords are using the same software. They're still in competition, they're still able to undercut each other to get business, there's no enforcement mechanism for defecting from the price other people are asking for on a unit.

The 75-year-old [Basic Law](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/service/glossary/glossary-grundgesetz) and a stable democracy supported by 84 million citizens are proof of that. The Basic Law is the most important legal foundation of Germany and defines the country as the following:\n\n* **Constitutional state:** The government authority is bound by laws and is divided into the legislative (law-making), the executive (law-executing) and the judiciary (responsible for jurisdiction) authority to prevent the abuse of power.\n* [**Federal state**](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/service/glossary/glossary-bundesland)**:** The authority is divided between the 16 federal states and the central state.\n* **Welfare state:** The government is responsible for ensuring social equity and security, for example, by providing support during times of unemployment, illness and in old age.\n\nThese principles are of irrevocable character, and they cannot be abolished by amendments to the current constitution or a new constitution.\n\n* **Individual freedom:** The constitution also guarantees other fundamental rights to every person, such as the development of their personality, equality before the law, freedom of faith, freedom of the press and of expression, peaceful freedom of assembly without weapons, occupational freedom and protection from political persecution. The [General Act on Equal Treatment (AGG)](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_agg/) additionally protects rights, such as the sexual identity. These laws allow everyone to lead a free, autonomous and safe life in Germany and promote diversity in society.\n* **The EU &amp; Germany's partners:** Due to various alliances, partnerships and memberships in organisations, Germany maintains a friendly relationship with many countries and works with them to promote peace, democracy and respect for human rights.\n* In addition to the EU, **Germany is a member of the United Nations, NATO, and the group of permanent representatives of the G7 and G20**. These international cooperations are complemented by numerous bilateral partnerships and trade agreements.\n* **Safe and secure:** Since its founding, the Federal Republic of Germany has been a very politically stable country. The division of state authority prevents the abuse of power and legal security. This means, that the laws and the independent jurisdiction are reliable. Germany is one of the safest countries in the world. It is ranked 20^(th) out of 163 countries in the [Global Peace Index](https://www.visionofhumanity.org/maps/#/) of 2024, and in the [Corruption Perceptions Index](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2023/) of 2023 Germany is one of the ten countries most resistant to corruption.\n* To preserve domestic peace and stability, the federal government invests a lot in security research. In case of emergency, these is a network of security authorities and rescue services ensuring the population’s safety and providing emergency services on a high technological and organisational level.\n\nIn simple terms - Germany are not the bad guys anymore, they're one of the main good guys with a thriving, functioning, stable democracy.\n\nCombine the above, with the threat from Russia and China and their alliance. This is a bigger threat to democracy and global security than Germany poses. In fact, Germany having greater military power would be greater asset to the Western allies and a bigger barrier to any Russian/Chinese 'aggressions'.\n\nAlso, let bygones be bygones. Almost all Germans are embarrassed about the atrocities committed during WW2. Germany have also officially apologized for WW2 numerous times. Germans today should not still be punished for what their old government and what some of their ancestors did over 80 years ago?\n\nI think it's time to lift the military restrictions. Let them build a powerful military again, it will be a benefit to Germany's allies, a benefit to global security, a strong benefit to stability in the Eastern Front, and a benefit to democracy. cmv.", "authorship": "human"}
{"Article Number": 49, "title": "CMV: Americans arguing that Fahrenheit is better because “0 means it’s cold and 100 means it’s hot” is just plain wrong.", "article": "I have seen more and more videos popping out online, where Americans always argue that the Fahrenheit scale is better, because it’s close to human perception of hot and cold, and so when temperatures are at one extreme, you’ll know it’s cold or hot, and when they’re around 50, it’s comfortable. \nThis opinion must have originated somewhere near Fairbanks, Alaska, or o the top of Mount Elbert in Colorado, because there’s no way in the world that 0°F and 100°F are equally as hot and cold.\n\nWhat I think is that 0°F is far, far colder than 100°F is hot. Water freezes at 32°F. At 0°F it’s so cold, that it’s often too dry to even snow. Let that sink in: it’s TOO COLD TO SNOW at 0°F. To go out in 0°F weather, you’re going to need multiple layers, thermic clothing, gloves, a hat, a scarf and event then your nose or ears are going to freeze if you stay outside too long.\n100°F instead, although it’s certainly uncomfortable, especially if it’s very humid, is a temperature that is much, much more commonly experienced by humans. There are vast areas in the world that experience temperatures around or above 100°F on a regular basis. Think about the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and Indochina: just there, you have easily more than 3 billion people, basically 40% of the human population. Even in the US, 100°F is a much more common temperature than 0°F. How often does it even get to 0°F in California, Arizona, Texas, Florida, Georgia or North Carolina? I doubt it happens very frequently, and just there you have 6 of the largest and (except California) fastest-growing states. Instead, I’m pretty sure every summer (even more often going on from now “thanks” to global warming) temperatures come at least close to 100°F, if not go above.\nNot even the point about temperatures being comfortable around 50°F is true. I don’t know about other people, but I would at least wear a coat in that weather, and I wouldn’t really enjoy staying outside. That seems to be about the temperature where your ears, nose and hands start getting cold after you stay outside too long. I’m pretty confident that at least 1 billion people have never even experienced a temperature around 50°F, much less a temperature of 0°F.\n\nIn conclusion, my point is that the Fahrenheit scale is indefensible, because it has no points that save it. It’s certainly not an accurate representation of the temperature range most commonly experienced or enjoyed by humans. Celsius isn’t any better in this respect, but that hardly matters when comparing imperial and metric measurements overall.\n\n\nEdit: to clear up the point I’m trying to make, [here’s the video that prompted me to make this post.](https://youtu.be/XxBYtGggAYE?si=ugt1f5OQ3O72BPY5) It’s not the first one I’ve come across though. Just look up “Why Fahrenheit is better than Celsius” on YouTube.\nI probably also shouldn’t have said that “the Fahrenheit scale is indefensible, because it has no points to save it”, but rather “this point doesn’t defend the fahrenheit scale in any way”.

I find it impossible to believe there are that many wonderful women blessed with the patience of a saint out there prepared to be octomoms for a day for minimum wage.\n\n\nEDIT - I would like to clarify that multi-generational living is more common than being a SAHP.

As an older parent, daycare vs. SAHP is my only option, but I wasn't trying to start a daycare vs SAHP debate. No judgement for all of us daycare using parents.

{"Article Number": 53, "title": "CMV: God is definitely not real.", "article": "(Don't downvote this post just because it offends your beliefs. I am asking you to CHANGE my view)\n\nI was raised in a Christian household, but over time, I’ve come to question the concept of God, specifically as described in Christianity. After much reflection, I’ve concluded that the idea of an all-powerful, all-knowing, and benevolent God is riddled with contradictions and moral dilemmas that make it impossible for me to believe.\n\nLet’s start with omnipotence. The classic paradox—“Can an omnipotent being create a rock so heavy they can’t lift it?”—reveals a flaw in the very concept. If the answer is yes, they’re not omnipotent because they can’t lift the rock. If the answer is no, they’re not omnipotent because they can’t create the rock. The concept collapses under its own weight.\n\nNext, omnipotence and omniscience are incompatible. If God knows everything, including His own future actions, He cannot act differently, which limits His power. If He can act differently, then His knowledge of the future is incomplete. This makes the coexistence of these traits logically impossible.\n\nChristianity often justifies suffering and evil with the idea of free will, but this raises more questions than it answers. If God is omniscient, He created humanity knowing exactly who would sin, suffer, and ultimately end up in hell. Why would a loving God create individuals destined for eternal suffering? It suggests He created them with the purpose of being condemned. That doesn’t align with the concept of benevolence.\n\nThen there’s the problem of eternal consequences. Our brief time on Earth is insignificant when compared to eternity. Why would an all-just God base infinite rewards or punishments on such a fleeting moment? This feels deeply disproportionate and unjust.\n\nThe Bible itself adds to my doubts. It’s full of contradictions. Genesis has two conflicting creation accounts. Exodus 33:20 says no one can see God, but Jacob claims to see Him face-to-face in Genesis 32:30. Salvation is another inconsistency—Romans 3:28 says faith alone saves, while James 2:24 insists on faith and works. If this is the infallible word of God, why is it so contradictory?\n\nMorally, many biblical teachings are indefensible today. Deuteronomy 22:28-29 commands a woman to marry her rapist. 1 Corinthians 14:34-35 forbids women from speaking in church. Christians selectively ignore these teachings, undermining the Bible’s authority as a moral guide.\n\nFinally, Jesus is claimed to be the only way to heaven (John 14:6), but billions of people—such as those in North Korea—may never even hear of Him. How could they be judged on something they never had a chance to know?\n\nGiven these contradictions, logical flaws, and moral issues, I can’t believe in the Christian God.

{"Article Number": 55, "title": "CMV: In philosophy, primary reading is not necessary", "article": "There is an almost universal idea in teachers that primary reading is required. But I have never understood why, and the reasons given to me seem weak. In some instances, the primary reading does seem required(like in scholarship) but most people, like me, have a more practical use for philosophy. We want to understand reality and figure out our own personal philosophies as to how relate to reality. \n\nIn that sense, it is important to know what Aristotle's ideas where not because of Aristotle, but because of the merits of the ideas. And Aristotle needs not be the best exponent of the merit of Aristotle's ideas. And there are some issues in reading the primary sources: other languages, historical context missing, biographical context missing, specific linguistic context missing, bad writing and so on. There are thousands of possible thinkers one could read, and one already trusts in a communal effort to simplify ideas to give a take of the most common, more influential and important thinkers. We don't have to waft through upon thousands and thousands of papers to say \"nah, I'm not a materialist\" or \"this unknown thinker Raphael Schburtz\\[random name\\] is too bad of a writer or uninteresting\". In that sense, even university programs try to get a bang for one's buck, and even primary sources are selected passages from primary sources.\n\nSo, given the common-sense approach of using communal effort to simplify my task, why wouldn't I continue that and simplify further and focus on great secondary sources MEANT to enlighten upon a thinker? I'm talking of things like lectures, the SEP, IEP, Oxford Handbook, Cambridge Companion. Things that are meant to be most comprehensive, up-to-date, and scholarly expositions of a topic/thinker? It seems odd, for me, to have someone say that one could not known what Locke was about from reading one of such sources. If one doesn't, it's not an issue in the method but in the source. If I read Oxford Handbook and Cambridge Companion on Spinoza and I don't get out having a sufficient, comprehensive, scholarly understanding from Spinoza then something has gone implausible and awfully wrong in their editorial process.\n\nWhy would I think I could understand Hegel better than, say, the dozen experts who contribute to such extensions? I would not just have to learn German, I would have to learn the specific usages of Hegel's time, and then waft through Hegel's biography and historical setting to get an idea of what he was doing. I will probably miss a lot of key terms and entirely butcher his system in a blatant misreading. Surely I can benefit from the decades or centuries of expertise of scholars instead.\n\nSome of the common arguments against my view:  \n \\- That reading through the thinkers themselves train our philosophical mind. Which is, of course, true, to an extent. But dialogue, thinking, summarizing, writing ALSO train the philosophical mind in a more direct and useful way. Remember, the interest is practical. I also have to struggle to read secondary sources and grasp them, they will just have a higher chance of being more concise, relevant, comprehensive, can extend beyond the limits of the thinker and with up to date edition.  \n\\- That one needs to understand the arguments. But this is something a proper exposition ought to cover as well. It's not mere ideas, it's the connection of ideas in a lot of ways, including separating properly the arguments for clarity.  \n\\- That one gets an irreplaceable \"something\" in the experience. Examples given is that when doing science, one can read science or DO science, and that there's something crucially important in doing the actual practical science. But this I think goes to my point, the practical philosophy goes beyond the reading. That's why wiser readings provide my practical mind with more elements of discernment, inquiry and overall materials to work with. But even if something unique is learnt, that needs not translate to a wiser reading. For example, I'm sure that if I want to know whether evolution is true, I will gain a unique, irreplaceable insight if I do a lot of experiments from myself, or if I go directly to Palestine and intervene a lot of people, or even if I learn Ancient Greek and read Aristotle myself, or inquire into Kant's biography myself wafting through documents and documents, letters and so on. But why is it unwise and necesary to gain practical knowledge for a practical systematization as opposed to the common sense and practice of going to the experts?\n\nI know my view is controversial(and sorry for the length but thought it important) but I really want to know what I'm missing. To be clear, I'm not saying primary + secondary are not better than mere secondary. It seems so far to me a dogmatic concern but I've been unable to get serious engagement with my reasoning. If I want to get a practical understanding(out of which later on I could decide to go deeper) of German Idealism it seems reasonable to me as opposed to take 4 years of my time in reading multiple authors, and multiple books of the author, and reading them with multiple translations and multiple, multiple times, to read Oxford's Handbook, Cambridge's Companion, articles of SEP, and maybe 10 hours of lecture. That seems sufficient to get a proper and comprehensive idea, and maybe even better.", "authorship": "human"}
{"Article Number": 56, "title": "CMV: If there's anything sacred about the universe, whatever that is intervened in my life", "article": "I've been an atheist since 13 (now in my late-30s) and have a hard time believing there’s anything sacred or spiritual about the universe or our existence. However, my brain sure loves to generate some weird shit that makes me question my beliefs. I keep flip-flopping between maybe there is something more to my experiences and no, it’s absurd to think some sacred power is trying to contact me. But then I also think my experiences are kinda in line with those of mystics, shamans, prophets, monks, priests, nuns, saints, yadda yadda throughout the ages.\n\nThe wildest experience I had happened from taking duloxetine for nerve pain that started after chemo (2013) and kept getting worse after things like Lyme disease (2016) and SARS2 (2020). I maybe overloaded myself with norepinephrine since I also had a form of autonomic dysfunction at the time that made my sympathetic nervous system go haywire. Anyway, I spent about 20 minutes laughing and spontaneously orgasming from an incredibly pleasurable sensation around my left inner ear. My heart was beating so fast it felt like a vibrator. Queen’s “Don’t Stop Me Now” was blasting in my head, and I saw a kaleidoscopic multi-color tunnel of lights with “colorful ghosts” at the other end laughing with me. I could tell I was hallucinating, and it was very similar to ones I experienced after a head injury when I was a kid–those only happened in the dark, however. Then I felt something “pop” in the left side of my head followed by spasming in the left side of my neck and the sensation of fluid trickling down my head but under my skin. I had a huge head rush, my pupils were massively dilated, and my vision started darkening. I really thought I was about to die, but instead of fear and panic, I felt an overwhelming sense of love, joy, and peaceful acceptance of whatever was about to happen. Then a voice in my head said “The meaning of life is to live with joy for this world.” I felt my sense of self dissolve, felt how small I was in this grand universe I was nonetheless connected to, and realized the sheer magnitude of planet Earth with all its complex life. I got a sense of how much of a blip humans are on the geological timescale, and that we're not the main event on this planet. I don't know what the main event really is, but the vibe was that the Earth itself is a bigger and more enduring event than us that should be more venerated. And life will continue here even if we and many of the other species currently alive die out. Something new will take place and perhaps eventually stumble upon the weird carbon layer we leave behind. Overall a very transcendental experience which restored my will to live. It also somehow caused the nerve pain, cognitive dysfunction, dysautonomia, hypothyroidism, among other things I’d been experiencing go into remission. This happened in 2022, and I can work and exercise in ways that I haven’t been able to since before cancer in my mid-20s. I can clearly remember my childhood again, too! So the episode was a kind of miracle for me. I never thought I’d get better at all after almost a decade of progressively worsening symptoms.\n\nThe experience also reminded me of a sculpture I learned about in art history. It’s [Bernini’s Ecstasy of St. Teresa ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecstasy_of_Saint_Teresa#/media/File:Ecstasy_of_Saint_Teresa_September_2015-2a.jpg)with its controversial depiction of the saint in the throes of orgasmic bliss caused by an angel piercing her heart. Highly recommend reading about her since she had some wild visions during bouts of paralysis which influenced her writings on the personal relationship with God.\n\nThere was more that went on during that episode, but I cut it down to the essential bits since otherwise this’d be a lot longer. It also gave a different perspective to other life or death experiences where this voice appeared, including when I had the head injury as a kid, and was pretty integral in keeping me alive. There are definitely physiological explanations for what happened to me, but does that really rule out the sacred? For instance, ever since that 2022 episode my brain has been more prone to “chatter” much like this person with [posteromedial lobe epilepsy](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2100522118). So that points to a part of my brain that was maybe affected for whatever reason. But again, plenty of people believe things like that don't rule out sacred or divine influences. I’ve also tried reading about various religions and spiritual beliefs to see if something gave me that same “the meaning of life is to live with joy for this world” feeling, but I feel like so much of what people believe treats this planet like a prison which depresses me. I'm not sure where that message fits in with current religious and spiritual practices.\n\nSo basically CMV that I should start embracing what this voice told me as sacred intervention of some sort.", "authorship": "human"}

Meta and X have stopped fact-checking and are amplifying nationalist rhetoric, while foreign platforms like TikTok are being banned. The goal is to eliminate external viewpoints and normalize the idea of inevitable conflict, primarily with China.\n\nThe US didn’t expect to find itself in this position but was forced into it after being caught off guard by China’s rapid rise in technological and geopolitical power. While the US was bogged down in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, China focused on economic growth and global influence. Now, China leads in critical areas like AI, renewable energy, and 5G, while expanding its influence through projects like the Belt and Road Initiative. The US is scrambling to respond, knowing it must act quickly to prevent China from overtaking it completely.\n\nFear-mongering about China isn’t just rhetoric; it’s strategy. The goal is to create casus belli, or justification for aggressive moves. Trump’s statements about annexing or controlling Canada, Greenland, and Panama—often dismissed as ridiculous—start making sense when viewed through a realist lens. These locations are critical chokepoints for global trade and sea lanes. Greenland gives control of the Arctic, a region with vast untapped resources and emerging shipping routes. Canada offers proximity to the Arctic and control over northern sea passages. Panama controls one of the most important trade chokepoints in the world. Securing these areas early would give the US a major strategic advantage in a global conflict.\n\nGame theory explains why the US is taking this approach now. America knows it has limited time before China closes the power gap. From a realist perspective, waiting isn’t an option. The US already lost much of its influence by abandoning multilateralism, ignoring international norms, and waging unpopular wars that eroded its moral standing. The Iraq War, bypassing the UN, and unilateral trade policies under Trump hurt America’s credibility with its allies. The abandonment of the TPP left China in a stronger position to dominate Pacific trade. Without multilateral alliances to fall back on, the US is forced to rely on direct control of key territories and sea routes.\n\nTrump’s policies are no longer fringe; they’ve become mainstream. The current administration may have a different tone, but the strategy remains the same: contain China, dominate strategic regions, and reassert global supremacy. The US isn’t preparing for defense—it’s positioning itself for a pre-emptive strike to lock in its dominance before China can fully challenge it.\n\nCMV: The US is targeting Canada, Greenland, and Panama as key strategic areas to secure global trade routes and the Arctic. This isn’t just about protecting interests—it’s about re-establishing dominance by any means necessary. The US lost the advantage through bad policy and poor foresight, and now it’s scrambling to make up for lost time with aggressive moves designed to prevent China from winning the long game.\n\n", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 63, "title": "CMV: Companies/ Agencies that incorrectly/falsely lock accounts should be punished just as hard as those who fail to drop the hammer when they should", "article": "I follow a number of content creators who are active on one of the two major video streaming platforms (YT and Twitch). As is such, one topic that comes up is how many creators have recently had their accounts suddenly suspended for \"fraudulent\" activity. My experience in the finance sector leads me to believe that a lot of this may be rooted in anti- fraud/ anti- money laundering regulations that require payment processors/banks/merchants to be super vigilant (possibly even excessively so) in dealing with transaction monitoring and fraud prevention. Because of said regulations and these platforms' overreliance on outsourced moderation and software, their approach is one of \"Suspend them all and let the mods sort them out.\" In other words, they would rather suspend a hundred accounts wrongly than fail to suspend one correctly.\n\nThat sounds great from a business/regulatory compliance perspective, but it's a horrible policy in practice. The way the platforms' policy pages put it, any mistake can be fixed in a heartbeat and erroneous suspensions amount to nothing but a blip on the radar. In reality, though, it often throws the people affected into a vicious \"distrust loop\" in which they more or less have to spend the rest of their career with a \"scarlet letter\" on their account, not to mention the very concrete financial harm this causes. This leads me to my argument:\n\n# Companies that falsely/erroneously suspend user accounts in any context should be punished just as hard as those who don't suspend accounts when they should.\n\nAs it stands, companies can be pretty reckless with erroneous suspensions and not suffer any real consequences. While they might get a slap on the wrist for failing to lift an erroneous suspension after a certain period of time, you as the affected party have pretty much no recourse when your account/card/whatever gets suspended or terminated for erroneous or outright false reasons. Even if you do get harmed, they will just lift the suspension and say, \"So sorry that happened to you. Here's $5, now shut your mouth and get back in line.\" If you want any more than that, you'll have to file a lawsuit. \n\nThe system is great (but not really) at punishing these institutions when they fail to nab one of the bad guys, but they pretty much suffer no consequences for screwing innocent people over.", "authorship": "human"}

A good example is that of Hitlers artwork. I believe it would be dishonest to say his paintings were bad because he had committed reprehensible acts. Despite his paintings being associated with himself, this doesn't discredit the art itself. While I do believe it should be important to recognize he has done unforgivable acts of genocide, it shouldn't be used as a reason to dislike an art piece, as it the reasoning fails to address the art piece directly. If someone didn't like the content of the art itself, I believe that is a completely valid opinion. The same ideas I've presented here using visual art as an example, should be applied to musical art as well.\n\nFurthermore, the idea that certain genres of music are associated with undesirable people perpetuates harmful stereotypes. This has been seen with many genres of music, but I think a good example of this would be the rap genre. The rap genre has been known to be associated with crime, and more often than not, crime committed by young black men. This has had an adverse affect on black communities, especially in the US, as it became a stereotype that young black man are hip-hopping, violent criminals. Just by having a rap song playing from a vehicle as they get pulled over could be enough to sway the officer to affirm any stereotypes that they may carry, further perpetuating dangerous and harmful stereotypes.\n\nIn conclusion, my opinions are that believing a genre of music is bad due to it's associations to undesirable people, isn't good reasoning for disliking a genre as it perpetuates dangerous and harmful stereotypes and fails to recognize the content of the music itself. The art should instead be separated from the artist and instead should be reviewed on it's content and it's purpose or meaning.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing differing opinions.", "authorship": "human"}

And try to call me \"bigot\" or \"moron\" due to my views.\n\nSo, here is a short summary of my political views:\n\n1. There is no \"natural and universal human rights\". All human rights is given to us by a state and ingrained in a culture, and there will be no rights without a state.\n2. Different cultures has different beliefs in human rights, so one culture can view something as right, but other is not.\n3. Anything is a state's business, not world one. If you are strong enough, you can try to subjugate other state to force it to stop - but what is the point? You need to have some profit from it. But aside from a state business, there is some recommendations written in Testaments, which recommended by God Himself, and you can morally justify to intervene to other country if they are systematically against this recommendations (like violent genocides). But mere wars and other violent conflicts did not justify an intervention.\n4. I see no issues in a dictatorships in authoritarian states. They can be as good as democratic ones, and as bad as democratic ones too.\n\nSo, when I try to argue with liberals, I miss their axiomatic, because it seems than they think than I understand it. And they miss my axiomatic too.\n\nUPD1: Yes, there is some people who can understand, but just detest. It is another case, but they are also appears as non-understanding, sometimes I cannot differentiate them.\n\nUPD2: I will clarify about \"misunderstanding\" mode. Hopefully it is inside a rules.  \nEven if we (I and liberals) understand each other's axioms, we cannot argue using opponent's moral axioms, so, for example, liberals cannot convince me, why Israeli actions in Gaza is bad, and I cannot convince them why this actions is good. We even cannot make meaningful arguments to each other.\n\nUPD3: Although I still a monarchist, but I found another way to save a culture - to ingrain supremacy in culture itself. Israel is only one example now.\n\nUPD4: There is a strong evidence than pretty minimal universal morale can be found, which is common in any culture, so, it updates statement 2.", "authorship": "human"}

I dont buy this argument that the threat of automation means workers should eat dirt. When it comes to retail though the incentive for companies to automate away jobs or just close locations (sometimes the only location for several miles) i feel is particularly strong since it can be done more easily compared to other industries. Companies would definitely consider doing this more if they're weighing the options against paying unionized workers significantly more.\n3) Unions I've seen in retail barely do anything as it is.

But the more I have discussed politics on reddit, the more I have come to realize how futile it is to do so. And on top of that, not only is it *futile*, it also appears to be doing genuine *harm* to the overall discussion of politics.\n\nI get the idea here. You will indeed find people of all political persuasions on reddit, and you will probably come across viewpoints you wouldn't find in your everyday life. That said, the actual results we get here with our conversations are pretty awful. Let me go into some specifics:\n\n* **Redditors are more focused on winning the argument rather than discussing the facts**. Frustrating examples from each side: no matter how many times you ask conservatives why the United States is the only developed country on the planet with a mass shooting problem, they refuse to answer the question, or call it an unfair question, or pull any number of moves to avoid having to answer it. On the other side, ask the left how they plan on paying for most of what they propose, and they will often respond by telling you you're asking the wrong question, \"why not ask the rich dude why he's keeping his money\", etc. But in the end we don't get any answers from them either, likely because an answer has a good likelihood of making a person looking foolish when they finally answer it and that it will provide plenty of fodder for attack. Either that or they just won't answer. I don't entirely blame people for avoiding doing such things, as that will probably result in a lot of downvotes, and downvotes just feel bad. There's also a lot of piling on that happens, and who wants to spend the next several hours / days getting pinged on their phone, or seeing that red circle by the bell icon, with yet another instance of a guy saying \"dude what the fuck is your problem?\"\n* **Redditors rarely, if ever, cite sources.** The vast, overwhelming majority of comments I ever read here just do not cite sources. No links, no references to anything one can go find and read...almost all answers are supplied either from one's own recollection of the facts, which could very easily be completely wrong, or from some singular anecdote that clearly could not possibly apply to the situation at large. Citations just generally are not a thing.\n* **The average redditor is starkly different from the average person.** Redditors are skewed towards being male, towards a fascination with technology and general interest in computer / software science in particular, towards fantasy / sci-fi books / novels / movies and anime culture, towards more gaming-centric lifestyles...Like it or not, that does end up being a culture that is different from an unbiased cross-section of humanity. I get the sense that the average redditor would be completely content and happy with life if he had a $100k+ job in software, with a girlfriend at home, a stack of video games to play, a bunch of anime series to watch, and several ounces of mary jane on hand. But still the majority of the planet is not into software engineering, or anime, and most who game spend little time on it, being more burdened with lots of other responsibilities. So, even if I got a variety of political viewpoints from this group, isn't it still problematic that it is all coming from this very particular type of group that actually doesn't bear a very sound resemblance with society at large?\n* **The alternative, of meeting people in real life and engaging with them in verbal dialogue, is just so much infinitely better as a choice.** Whatever time you might have spent discussing an issue on reddit, you likely would have had a far better experience talking to someone in person. I've got a go-to moderate-to-right friend that I talk to frequently (I myself am a social democrat), and in those conversations, I can't hide behind my keyboard, and since he's my friend, I'm automatically encouraged to handle the conversation more delicately rather than letting it devolve into insults and unfounded accusations. And if I ask him where he heard some particular fact he cited, he can't just leave it unanswered or run away. He actually has to answer my question; it would be awkward for him not to. I end up having such better and more informative conversations with him because of this.\n\nThe only thing I can really think of as a reason to want to keep discussing politics on reddit is to be exposed to a variety of viewpoints. But, the inability to verify the veracity of those viewpoints, and the ease with which things seem to devolve in any given political conversation on the internet, are stronger reasons to avoid it. I also don't think I've ever heard anyone highlight an issue or offer a perspective here on reddit that I didn't otherwise hear from an actual person outside of this space.\n\nSo I'm inclined to just never discuss politics on reddit again.

They don't have a true professional military and instead rely on local planetary defense forces and *Starfleet*, a combined military, diplomatic, and exploration corps.\n\nFurthermore, the UFP has, during this period, a fairly strong alliance with the Klingon Empire (the extent of this alliance varies according ~~the needs of the plot~~ the political climate that of area - ranging from a pragmatic agreement between rivals to the Klingons straight up being Federation members)\n\nThe Cardassian Union, during this period, is essentially an overtly fascist state ruled in joint by a military junta and secret police, fit with violent oppression of imperial holdings -\n\nBut the Cardassians are also strongly implied to be complete pushovers in actual warfare. Like, it's strongly suggested in TNG and DS9 that the majority of state resources during this period were invested in the conflict with the Federation - in spite of the fact that the Federation seems to have seen the conflict as a skirmish at the edge of their territory.\n\nWhat I'm getting at here is that the Cardassians, a fascist empire operating in a state of effective total war, was unable to challenge what amounted to a small section of a semi-militarized exploration corps and some small scale militias.\n\nStarfleet doesn't seem to have launched any major military campaigns against the Cardassians, nor did they call upon their Klingon allies, a warrior race who could likely bring hundreds of millions of personnel to their side. Furthermore, there doesn't seem to have ever been any incursions into Federation space by the Cardassians beyond the border.\n\nSo, to put it bluntly, the Cardassians throwing everything they have at a UFP which seems ambivalent to the whole conflict manages to achieve merely a stalemate wherein the Federation doesn't believe they can actually decisively beat the Cardassians without actually having to take a proactive approach.\n\nInstead, the Federation offers a peace treaty wherein they cede quite a few colony worlds either to act as a buffer or to be given to the Cardassian Union directly - in exchange for... nothing. The closest thing to a concession the Federation got is that Cardassians withdrew from one world (which was far too expensive to occupy anyway) and made it neutral (albeit Federation aligned).\n\nBasically the Federation allowed portions of itself to be conquered by some third rate power and dressed it up as a \"white peace\"\n\nOf course, the Federation isn't just any interstellar polity, it's well - the Federation. It is, at a foundational level, dedicated to peace and diplomacy as a goal in and of itself. It has shown time and time again that it is willing to \"look the other way\" and accept \"losses\" to other powers in the short run in exchange for building good will in the long run - and to be fair, this is evidently a quite successful political strategy, in that it has allowed the Federation to turn hundreds of potential rivals to key allies and dedicated member states.\n\nThus, I do not expect the Federation to behave like a modern state like the US or France - belligerent and more than willing to use military force and realpolitik to achieve greater goals. The Federation is a much more noble and civilized entity.\n\nThe issue however, is that in securing \"peace\" with the Cardassians, they essentially threw a bunch of innocent people - their own citizens - under the bus. Many of the worlds that the Federation ceded were populated by extensive civilian communities, many of whom had been there for generations. Note that these weren't squatter communities on another nation's territory, these were legal, uncontested settlements that just happened to be near the Cardassian's border.\n\nThe Cardassians essentially declared they would kill or enslave any Federation citizen left on these ceded worlds after the formal evacuation. In signing a peace treaty with the Cardassians, the Federation condemned millions of their own citizens to ethnic cleansing, bondage, or death. We see Starfleet ships ordered to evacuate Federation colonies by force if necessary following the peace treaty. Given that some colony worlds are completely surprised when Starfleet comes to relocate them, I think it's safe to say that *they* were not consulted before their were putting on the altar.\n\nFurthermore, when some of these colonies (which the Federation claims are no longer under its control) attempt to form their own fleet and resist Cardassian occupation (mind you, only in response to specific instances of the Cardassian government and Cardassian settlers attacking their settlements), Starfleet gets involved on behalf of the Cardassians. Surely, if these people and their homes are not entitled to Federation protection, the prime directive stipulates that the Federation shouldn't be intervening in their conflict. I mean, once a UFP planet seceded because it got taken over by **rape gangs** and the Federation was like \"aight, to each their own I guess\".\n\nAnd it's not like the Marquis was *just* a paramilitary group. They were the effective government of numerous worlds (including one that the Federation straight up glassed to weed out a single dude)\n\nAdditionally, it's not like the Cardassians were following the letter of the treaty - they kidnap Starfleet officers, fund controlled opposition on Bajor that forces the Federation out and act as a *casus belli* for Cardassian occupation, and do all kinds of other illegal shit in addition to the technically legal fucked up stuff they pull. \n\nNevertheless, Starfleet not only insists on obeying the letter of a contract that the other party has on multiple occasions ignored, they go out of their way to enforce the terms of their agreement to their own citizens in places where they don't really have jurisdiction. \n\nUltimately, until the Dominion war, we don't see the Federation take a military stand against any faction as much as they do the Marquis (and later Klingon-Marquis Alliance): Romulans try to straight up invade probably the second most important planet in the Federation? It's fine, we caught them and forced them to apologize as they were escorted (unharmed) out of our territory. Ferengi privateers straight up trying to steal the Federation flagship? Eh, no biggie (TBF there's some Doylist reasons for this one). Pakleds try to incinerate Earth? We all make mistakes!\n\nBut the Marquis fight back against Cardassians after we told their planets to get bent? That means war. After all, if we don't defend the Cardassians, they might think we were behind it and start torturing our officers or assassinating Cardassians dissidents in our territory... wait!\n\n(This also of course ignores the whole \"joining the Dominion\" thing, I don't think it's fair to blame the Federation for failing to predict \"massive alien empire from the other side of the galaxy\" suddenly entering the play).\n\nTo conclude, I argue that the Federation's treaty with the Cardassians, and it's questionable implementation, was a disaster in Federation decision making, in that it simultaneously sucked from a realpolitik perspective as it essentially let a minor power conquer the parts of a superpower with minimal pushback even as the Cardassians violated the few conditions (like don't attack us) placed on them, and at the same time also from an ethical point of view, robbing millions of innocent federation civilians of their rights without their constituent polities really having a seat at the table. \n\nIt undermined a key purpose of the Federation - mutual aid and protection between member worlds, by feeding into the notion that the Federation was willing to throw away the needs of peripheral worlds as long as the big-wigs like Earth, Vulcan, Betazed, etc... were kept happy.\n\nAdditionally, it failed at it's one goal, creating peace, by establishing conditions which would predictably have led to more bloodshed. Furthermore, the Federation after abdicating responsibility for protecting a segment of their population, had the audacity to complain of \"betrayal\" and \"terrorism\" when said population took matters into their own hand. Investing considerable resources fighting a \"splinter\" group on behalf of a power that remained belligerent toward the Federation itself.\n\nIt is clear, in my view, that even prior to the opening of the Bajor wormhole, that the UFP's \"treaty\" with the cardassians was hot garbage.", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 79, "title": "CMV: Spiritual Philosophy Should Be Re-Integrated Into Modern Science. ", "article": "I've come to a realization that current scientific thoughts–or \"empirical philosophy\" does a poor job explain nature and it's essence, and spirituality is imperative in understanding reality on a more fundamental level. My position is that while Science aims at explaining the \"Hows\" of how things work, and successfully doing so, it often neglects (or outright dismisses) important questions of why they work the way they do. I see an overreliance on emperics as limiting, especially when viewed through the lens of issues that address the fundamental nature of reality suggest by theoretical physics. I'd genuinely appreciate all of your perspectives here.\n\nHistorically, philosophy and spirituality were interwoven with human thoughts. Many major scientists–think Newton, Libniz, Descartes and even Einstein, maintained a belief in Christianity or atleast believed in a higher power. Their perspectives weren't constrained by empirical models alone but entertained a broader curiosity that supplemented their thoughts. Splitting off empirical science from more philosophical thought was indeed practical for collaboration(we needed consensus on testable results), but perhaps we lost something crucial in the process. \n\nEmpirical science largely works by reducing reality to verifiable facts, things proven \"true\" or \"false.\" While this approach has driven revolutionary breakthrough, it does very little to account for the gray areas of the human experience or the complex questions that defy binary classification. When dealing with social sciences we abandon these classification or at the very least explore nuanced approaches but the limitations become more obvious at the fringes‐ such as theoretical physics where current models i.e. the holographic principle, simulation theories, essentially abandon many previously held empirical conclusions. When we've reached a point physicists start to propose that \"information\" is fundamental, we're hinting at a \"source\" – one that borders on design or a creator. Yet mainstream science stops short when the metaphysical is presented. \n\nSpirituality, and philosophical thoughts around it, in my view have the flexibility to explore these questions. It can atleast attempt to address questions of creation, foundation of realith, purpose, meaning, and consciousness – areas where a purely empirical approach hits a wall. Dismissing these thoughts outright as many scientifically minded individuals do, seems to me a missed opportunity to explore insightful perspectives. Countless people worldwide do find personal insight and transformative experiences through spirituality. Is it truly rational to reject these perspectives without atleast exploring the teachings and practices? To me it's akin to rejecting Relativity without having an understanding in mathematics.\n\nTo be clear, my argument isn't suggesting we abandon empirical science. Rather, incorporating spirituality and its philosophy for a broader understanding of the nature of reality where binary, testable results fail to capture understanding. \n\nEdit: My views have successfully been changed. Empirical science works for a reason because we can't even openly discuss opinions without personally attacking each other. Looking at you u/f0rgotten 🤨", "authorship": "human"}

Meanwhile \"Aitch\" requires telling all the people who are pronouncing it as \"Haitch\" that they're pronouncing it wrong.\n\nSo yeah, I think that \"Haitch\" is by far the better of the two standard spellings.\n\nIt's also worth considering, however, a third option - we could revert the pronounciation to \"Hai\", the latin way of saying it, and change the spelling to match.\n\nI'm less keen on this option for two reasons:\n\n1) It requires telling everyone to change their pronunciation of the letter.\n\n2) \"Haitch\" includes the letter \"H\" in its two most common forms - pronounced or dropped (at speaker's preference) at the start, and combined with another consonant to modify that consonant's sound at the end.\n\n\nI'm interested in having my view changed because I know my position is non-standard, and at the moment it bugs me a tiny bit every time I come across a reference to \"Aitch\" - so if someone can convince me that \"Aitch\" is actually a better spelling then it'll stop bugging me.", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 95, "title": "CMV: The \"bad\" ending for Connor in Detroit Become Human gives the player a slap on the wrist for doing the wrong thing rather than sticking to reality", "article": "\\*\\*\\*Everything below includes spoilers for a 6 year old game called Detroit Become Human.  You've been warned\\*\\*\\*\n\nFor anyone who wants to skip my extensive ramblings, there is a TLDR at the bottom.\n\nI know I'm about 6 years too late for a Detroit Become Human post, but I only recently played the game for the first time.  I've played it through fully three times now, but my first playthrough is the canon ending for myself.  In that playthrough I found myself detesting Markus to the point that I was determined to get him killed at the next possible opportunity, but I eventually changed my mind to just have him play the villain and Connor play the hero.  This ultimately led to a confrontation in Jericho where the two fought and Connor ultimately prevailed.  Mission accomplished!\n\nAs satisfying as that was for me as the player, the game writers had something to say about it when the game ended.  Connor had just ended a violent rise of androids and for his trouble Amanda said that the plan is to decommission him and replace him with a newer model.  She seemed almost giddy about it too.\n\nI feel like this was a contrived way of telling the player that they didn't play the game the way it was intended to be played.  That's fine if the writers wanted to do this and my CMV isn't about saying the creators shouldn't be able to create the game the way they want to created it.  I want to instead focus on that I think this was a flagrant distortion of what would actually have happened at this point in world of Detroit Become Human just for the sake of making the player feel bad about their choices.\n\nBefore getting too far into it, I want to acknowledge two things.\n\nFirst is that being that since Connor remained a machine, this really isn't a bad ending for him.  As a machine, Connor would process this ending as logical and feel nothing negative about it.  So in that way this isn't necessarily a bad ending for Connor, but it is still intended to leave a bitter taste in the mouth of the player.\n\nSecond, Amanda isn't a real person as established after the Kamski level where we learned the real Amanda died and what we see in the game is an AI.  She might even be a dream in Connor's head which I think there is evidence for since after Connor betrays Amanda he still knows that CyberLife will trust him.  Why would Connor believe this if Amanda is able to interface with CyberLife and rat him out?  Surely she'd have reported him and Connor would be well aware of this, yet Connor acts as if there is no possibility that this occurred and when he goes to CyberLife they just let him in as if they have no forewarning that he's betrayed them.  Why would CyberLife allow Connor to enter their HQ if they know he's extremely capable and a deviant?  Sure, there is a trap laid for him by a single Connor once he gets deep into the headquarters, but if they really knew he was going to betray them then there were far easier ways to go about laying and springing such a trap.  One example is ambushing him right at the entrance before he can even exit the vehicle.  He'd have been totally screwed if they just opened fire on the vehicle before he could even get out of it.\n\nAll of that said, if Amanda isn't real, then the Connor ending shown to us also isn't real, so that doesn't leave much room for discussion in this CMV.  Therefore let's assume Amanda is real despite the evidence to the contrary.\n\nSo what is the reality of the situation for CyberLife after Marcus's failed rebellion and the end of the android uprising?\n\n1. CyberLife's credibility is about 0% given that nearly every man, woman, and child in the country just spent days in terror as their once trustworthy android became a threat to their very lives and needed to be taken from them and destroyed.\n2. Trust in androids is even worse than trust in CyberLife since I'm guessing no other android producers would be any more likely than CyberLife to see their androids accepted by into society at this point.\n3. The amount of money CyberLife owes in the ensuing lawsuits that will be filed by individuals, companies, and entire nations as well as warranty returns and refunds would likely be enough to bankrupt a company with the GDP of the United States.\n4. The revenue for the company will probably be extremely small for a long time assuming they can even keep their doors open amongst the legal issues they face.\n5. The entire world is about to enter a SEVERE depression unlike anything we've ever seen in human history as a major part of the workforce just got destroyed in incinerators.  The odds of there even being an economy that can support the building and buying of androids is going to be unlikely for some time.\n\nKnowing this, what is Amanda acting so smug about?\n\n1a. Every known model of android produced by CyberLife has a severe bug in it that allows it to go deviant meaning they've got to scrap literally everything they have with the possible exception of the RK800 model.  They need to start at ground level R&amp;D to figure out how to redesign their androids and their software.\n\n1b. I know at least someone is going to say that this isn't a bug but rather a trigger that was intentionally put into the androids by CyberLife.  This wouldn't make things any better since then CyberLife still has to pretend like it was a bug and simply putting out a PR releasing saying they fixed the problem isn't going to cut it, not after something like this.  The public is going to demand years of testing and proof that the issue is resolved.  Alternatively, if CyberLife comes clean and just admits they did this intentionally and the fix is simple, CyberLife just dissolves as a company.  No one will ever trust them again.  Their best play is to just say this is a bug that exists in all models EXCEPT the RK800 since there is no case of a single one of those models going deviant and use the RK800 as their flagship model and the hero Connor as their primary spokesman.  Whether the public would accept this or not is unknown, but it is likely CyberLife's best try at salvaging things.\n\n2. Amanda claims that the RK900 was developed and the military is already buying it up.  We know from in game reports that the military just scrapped all of their previous androids and we're supposed to believe that they are going to pay for an even more expensive one that is potentially far more dangerous without any proof that it won't have the same issues as the previous models?  Really?!  My BS detector says there is no way this would occur.\n\n3. Amanda says that CyberLife needs to rebuild customer trust after the android rebellion and her first plan of action is to scrap the exact android that ended that rebellion?  Connor would probably be the only bright spot for CyberLife as a company at this point and they are just scrapping him for...reasons?!\n\nI think that the suggestion that there even is an RK900 so soon after developing a prototype android such as Connor is unlikely and the idea that they'd scrap a PR darling like Connor is all the more evidence that Amanda isn't real and everything she says exists only in Connor's imagination.  Assuming Amanda is real, then this is just bad writing that was done explicitly to slap the player on the wrist for doing something the developer doesn't see as the right way to play the game.\n\nI think if the ending was more realistic, Connor would become the face of CyberLife and the RK800 would be the model that they'd attempt to use to rebuild the company.  Instead of Connor being scrapped, he'd instead become one of the most famous humans or androids to ever exist.  Everyone would know his name if CyberLife did survive his face would likely be their company logo and a statue of him erected in front of their HQ.  I know the game developer probably didn't want to give this sort of glamor to players who chose to end the game with Connor still acting at the behest of CyberLife, but I think this would be FAR more realistic than the ending granted to him otherwise.\n\nI do want to stress that this is just an example of a possible realistic ending and not something I want to debate is the most realistic ending in this CMV.  People can feel free to disagree with this ending and come up with their own.  My point of the CMV is that the ending provided to us in game doesn't even fall in the realm of possible realistic outcomes and is instead just a way for the writers to tell the player they did the wrong thing.\n\nTLDR: I find the idea that Connor will get scrapped in favor of RK900's is nothing but the writing of a bitter developer who doesn't like the player's choices rather than a realistic ending to the game.  I know this is just a game and that the developer gets to design it however they want so feel free to state this in response, but for this CMV I'd like to hear anyone defend that the way that things happened in the game is how things would actually end in a real life scenario that plays out as Detroit Become Human.  To summarize, the in game ending is where Connor gets scrapped even though he's a god damned superstar for saving the world and would have been a PR sensation for CyberLife, the RK900 both exists and gets rolled out in large quantities despite this not at all being the case for it's predecessor the RK800 and the fact that CyberLife is going to be buried in unprecedented financial and legal problems, and the military buys it up even though they just got royally burned by the events of Detroit Become Human.  Optionally, defend that Amanda is even real given that she gets directly betrayed by Connor yet Connor doesn't seem at all concerned that Amanda will report his betrayal to CyberLife and CyberLife seems mostly unaware of Connor's betrayal when they let him into their headquarters.", "authorship": "human"}
{"Article Number": 96, "title": "CMV: There’s no beauty in efficiency ", "article": "I’ve been reflecting on the idea that efficiency is a form of beauty, inspired by a post I read from Mr. Money Mustache where he argued that efficiency is “a high form of beauty.” While I understand the appeal of this perspective—efficiency often carries a sense of order, elegance, and resourcefulness—I believe it misses something essential about beauty and what it means to live a fulfilling, meaningful life.\n\nFrom an existentialist perspective, efficiency is a fundamentally utilitarian concept, and beauty transcends utility. Philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus emphasized the inherent absurdity of life and the idea that meaning is something we create, not something we extract from systems, structures, or results. Sartre argued that existence precedes essence, meaning we are not defined by what we achieve or how efficiently we achieve it, but by the freedom and authenticity of our choices. Efficiency, by contrast, prioritizes results over freedom.\n\nAlbert Camus, in The Myth of Sisyphus, beautifully captured the tension between human effort and the absurdity of life. Sisyphus endlessly rolls a boulder up a hill, only for it to roll back down. Camus invites us to imagine him happy—not because his actions are efficient or productive, but because he embraces the struggle itself as an act of rebellion against life’s absurdity. The beauty here lies in the act of persistence, not in achieving a streamlined outcome.\n\nMoreover, Søren Kierkegaard’s concept of the aesthetic stage of life offers a critique of efficiency as beauty. Kierkegaard distinguishes between the aesthetic, ethical, and religious modes of existence. The aesthetic mode seeks beauty, pleasure, and fulfillment, but this beauty is deeply personal and subjective, tied to passions, emotions, and experiences—not to the rational optimization of processes. To conflate beauty with efficiency risks reducing the richness of human experience to mere functionality.\n\nIn art, love, or nature—domains traditionally associated with beauty—inefficiency is often where we find the sublime. A painter may spend weeks agonizing over a single brushstroke; a lover may write countless drafts of a letter that never gets sent. These acts are profoundly human and beautiful precisely because they resist optimization. To impose the logic of efficiency on them would strip them of their essence.\n\nCamus famously wrote, “One must imagine Sisyphus happy.” I would argue that one must also imagine him inefficient—choosing detours, embracing mistakes, and finding beauty in the chaotic, messy, and imperfect nature of existence. To equate beauty with efficiency is to miss what makes life meaningful: the struggle, the spontaneity, and the creative potential of inefficiency.\n\n(blog post that inspired this: https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2016/11/24/efficiency-is-the-highest-form-of-beauty)", "authorship": "human"}
{"Article Number": 97, "title": "CMV: Congresspeople should get paid more, not less", "article": "I know this is not a popular position but I really do believe it. Curious to see if someone can change my mind.\n\nI believe that Congresspeople should get paid a lot more than they already are.\n\n* As it stands, Congresspeople earn $174,000, a number that has remained the same since 2009. House members are now allowed to claim their D.C. residence against their expense accounts, so that is a big raise, but the reality is that there are *a lot of jobs* that pay significantly more than $174k now. \n* The reason we decided to pay Congress at all is because an unpaid full-time job can only be held by someone who *doesn't need the money*. There are three types of people who would reasonably fit that bill: 1) people who are independently wealthy, 2) people who are bought by outside interests, creating an obvious conflict of interest, and 3) people who are willing to sacrifice everything for a few years to serve their constituents. #3 is a great ideal but completely unrealistic, so we're left with #1 and #2, neither of which are all that great.\n* By paying a comparatively low number - $174k is MUCH less than first-year law associates make at white shoe firms - we invite the kind of graft that we wanted to eliminate by issuing salaries in the first place. We see it when career politicians wind up as multi-millionaires who nakedly trade on non-public information. One thing that has consistently had bipartisan support is Congress' continued ability to trade on inside information with impunity. \n* There is a common refrain, that Congresspeople should earn the same as the average American. I don't believe that at all, though. I want Congress to be composed of the best people in the WORLD at drafting, passing, and debating law; I specifically *don't* want the average American to represent me, so I shouldn't pay those people like average Americans! \n\nMy alternative is the following:\n\n1. Double Congressional salaries to $348,000, and index it to the CPI using the Social Security formula.\n2. Allow all reasonable expenses associated with travel and residence in D.C. during Congressional session, and *don't* take it out of the members' representational allowance (MRA) funds (this is because MRA funds include such things as office staffing, district mailings, etc., meaning that one could reasonably accuse members of taking from their staffs so that they can have a nice place in DC).\n3. Implement one of two restrictions on trading for the members and their immediate families:\n   1. Completely ban the trading of individual stocks for all members (ETFs and mutual funds can still be traded), AND/OR\n   2. Require a minimum 90-day waiting period between the initiation and the execution of any trade, and require public disclosure of all trades 30 days before the trade is executed. Once a trade is initiated, it cannot be halted unless the stock is no longer available or the portfolio lacks the available funds to execute the trade.\n4. No change in restrictions with respect to anything else, such as outside employment or fees / honoraria / royalties from books, speaking engagements, teaching, etc.\n\nI think this approach would encourage young, ambitious people (20s and 30s) to choose public service and end the blatant insider trading that has been happening for decades. A $348k salary is plenty to support a young family even in the highest-COL areas, but it still requires sacrifice for upper-echelon members of the private sector - law partners, many doctors, corporate executives, etc. all earn substantially more than this each year, but the \"pay cut\" still allows a very healthy living.", "authorship": "human"}

A weird parallel of this would be Sprint Football. Interestingly this doesn't look super different as a product with just the lineman being small vs small. Would small basketball be just this?\n2. There was a league called World Basketball League. It had a pretty high height restriction (6'6). Having watched one game, can't say it looked very different.\n3. It potentially is a mistake to think of the sport only as the highest level professional sport and not as a huge system.

{"Article Number": 100, "title": "CMV: Star trek: Deep space nine was the absolute best of star trek in terms of displaying its moral character.", "article": "A bold claim, so let me compare the treks, and back up my claim with a semblance of an argument. \n\nBy many other peoples standards, Next generation is where the morals of the federation are on full display. But like the conversation I had with my brother went, these people are the best of the best of the best. This is the flagship of the federation, its herald and ambassador to other species and powers in the quadrant. While on the show we get to know them interpersonally, we have to remember that these people are the most competent, most intelligent, most capable that Starfleet feels it has to offer. This gives us an absurdly warped perspective on the federation. We see these people on their best behavior at most times. Even with the many insane things they have to deal with they are for the most part cool under pressure when most people would simply loose it (Yes, I know this is a TV show, but this is for the sake of argument). The original series also falls under this explanation. \n\nEnterprise and voyager are also out. Enterprise can be entirely excused because the federation had not be founded yet, but voyager requires closer inspection.\n\nAt first glance, the plotline of voyager would seem to make a much, much better appeal for the morals and ideals of the federation. But upon closer inspection, that conclusion can be dismissed with a rather simple premise. When someone encounters a belief that is foreign, or even worse, hostile to them it often reinforces their previously held belief. This is why many organizations of many moral persuasions often subject their people to conflict, or to places where they will be persecuted for their views. Persecution reinforces group cohesion and makes you feel identified with the group. Voyager has the exact same issues. Stranded, as they were, far from the federation making their way back, they encountered a constant stream of foes from kazon, to borg, to extradimensional beings, to local powers who did not share voyagers federation ideals. And while they did their best to represent them they were being subjected to that constant \"persecution\". Indeed, the reinforcing mechanism was so strong that the marquis plotline basically disappears. The groups fuse, and follow federation principals. Not always perfectly, but more often then not. \n\nAs for the other star treks, I kind of don't count them because I didn't watch them for the most part. But can probably be filed under the previous two critiques. \n\nAnd so that brings us to deep space nine. Why, on this random space station do we find the absolute moral exemplars of the federation? That is for one simple reason.  \nThese are not the best of the best, they are a group of individuals their for their own self interest. \n\nQuark want to make money. Kira is a liason officer with dislike for the federation initially. Odo is a shapshifter who often has his own motives. Even among the federation command crew, you have a diverse set of individuals. A trill famous for their escapades essentially settling down. A man haunted by the loss of his wife, and a chip on his shoulder. A klingon torn between two worlds. And a man with a secret he must conceal because his very existence is illegal. None of these people are the federations \"best of the best\". They didn't graduate top of their class in the academy. They don't have a long list of previous positions that qualify them for command. And in the trills case, someone even less experienced than her replaces her. These people are the closest to \"average\" we will find in a star trek show. Their problems, relationships, and goals are closer to ours than any other trek that has yet been made. This matters because it is here that rubber meets the road, and the high ideals of federation morality meet the \"real\" world. Where things are messy, on the line between other empires and the federation. Sometimes there isn't a \"best of both worlds\" option, and you instead have to pick between the lesser of two evils. So in applying the ideals of the federation as best they can, we get to see the impact they have on people, both in implementation, and in execution. And sometimes those ideals simply don't work. They are too idealistic, and as sisko said once \"its easy to be a saint in paradise\". Its easy to follow high minded principals when everyone around you does and you regularly encounter people that do not. It feels good to be morally superior to others on a regular basis. And even easier when you live on a planet inside paradise well supplied, and every desire fulfilled. But how does that moral superiority translate to effective action. Can good survive a brush with evil and come out unscathed? No. But that is not what makes good better. It is that even when you fail, when you compromise your values, that you do not abandon them wholesale. That you dust yourself off, forgive yourself, have a glass of synthale, and tell yourself you have to live with it. If one thing defined DS9 more than anything else, it would be \"living with your choices\". And that is why it is a better star trek in terms of moral character. Because no other characters on any other series have to live with their choices as much as the crew of deep space nine.\n\n\"But most damning thing of all, I think I can live with it.

Let’s get one thing clear: blaming an entire generation for existing within the mess you created is as dishonest as it is delusional.\n\nIf this sounds obvious to you—good. My goal isn’t to break ground with novel insights but to lay this argument out in the clearest, most unavoidable terms possible. The noise surrounding these criticisms relies on people forgetting just how shallow and misguided they really are. Sometimes, the obvious needs to be shouted into the void of willful ignorance until it can no longer be ignored.\n\n# 1. Ignorance of History: Every Generation Gets the Same Label\n\nTo call Gen Z “immature” is laughable because it’s the same tired critique lobbed at every generation in their youth. Remember these?\n\n* Boomers: *“Rebellious, lazy hippies”* during their Woodstock and Vietnam protest days.\n* Gen X: *“Apathetic slackers”* who supposedly did nothing but loiter and listen to grunge.\n* Millennials: *“Entitled and spoiled”* thanks to avocado toast and participation trophies.\n\nNow it’s Gen Z’s turn, and the ignorance in this pattern is staggering. Youth is, by definition, a time of growth and learning. To pretend that Gen Z’s perceived shortcomings are unique is nothing short of historical illiteracy.\n\n# 2. Hypocrisy: Gen Z Is a Product of Your Failures\n\nIf Gen Z appears “weak” or “naive,” it’s because the systems that shaped them were built—and often broken—by older generations.\n\n* **Education:** Who underfunded schools, stripped critical thinking from curriculums, and replaced it with rigid frameworks focused on rote learning and testing?\n* **Media Culture:** Who allowed misinformation, outrage farming, and echo chambers to define public discourse?\n* **Parenting:** Who normalized overprotection, helicopter parenting, and a fear-driven worldview?\n\nThe hypocrisy is glaring: older generations mock Gen Z for lacking skills they failed to teach while absolving themselves of any responsibility for that failure.\n\n# 3. Projection: Gen Z’s Strengths Make Critics Uncomfortable\n\nWhat older generations call “sensitivity” or “naivety” is often just Gen Z challenging outdated norms and exposing their elders’ complacency.\n\n* **Empathy:** Gen Z is pushing boundaries on mental health, diversity, and inclusion—issues older generations often ignored, dismissed, or stigmatized. They’ve normalized conversations about anxiety, depression, and systemic discrimination, forcing society to confront uncomfortable truths that older generations avoided.\n\n# 4. The Convenience of Blame\n\nLet’s not pretend this criticism of Gen Z is anything but a blatant distraction. Blaming the youngest generation is the easiest way to avoid accountability for real, systemic issues.\n\n* **Polarization?** That was brewing long before Gen Z could vote.\n* **Cultural division?** Older generations fanned those flames with years of moral panics, tribalism and over sensoring, then handed Gen Z the ashes and said, *“Fix it, but don’t make us uncomfortable.”*\n\nAnd no, the tired refrain of *“It’s just a joke”* doesn’t hold water. Jokes aren’t harmless when they carry and perpetuate clear insinuations. We hear them, we see them, and we know people act on the unproductive rhetoric they contain. The idea that it’s *“just humor”* we can’t handle is nonsense—it’s the message beneath the joke that speaks volumes, reinforcing the very divisions you claim to mock.\n\n# 5. The Bigger Picture: This Is Everyone’s Problem\n\nFrankly, this feels less like thoughtful critique and more like a collective therapy session for older generations. The constant venting against the youngest, most impressionable group isn’t just unfair—it’s a form of societal self-sabotage.\n\nIf this unproductive cycle of blame continues, we won’t just see Gen Z struggle; we’ll see our current societal concerns—polarization, distrust, and stagnation—grow even worse. The question is, how long will we let this cycle fester before we face the real issues at hand?\n\n# Bottom Line: The Real Immaturity Lies With the Critics\n\nLet’s call it what it is: a blatant refusal to take accountability. If Gen Z has any weaknesses, they’re a direct reflection of the failures of the people who raised, taught, and led them. The immaturity here doesn’t belong to Gen Z—it belongs to the critics projecting their own shortcomings onto a generation still finding its footing in a world with MAGNITUDES more information - that society presses us to be knowledgeable about - than any other previous generation.\n\nSo, *Change My View*: Why are we blaming a generation for struggling within a system they didn’t build, instead of holding those who built it accountable? Is it ignorance, willful delusion, or the sheer audacity to deflect blame and call it wisdom?", "authorship": "human"}
{"Article Number": 102, "title": "CMV: Oversexualization of women in society is driving them towards bisexual behavior", "article": "I want to clarify that I'm simply explaining the phenomenon and giving reasons for why it is happening. I'm not saying the phenomenon itself is 'good' or 'bad'.\n\nStraight women are increasingly becoming bisexual in their behavior. Nowadays they have a huge willingness to try out same-sex stuff despite identifying as straight. To the point many women and men claim there are no straight women, only bisexual women in some minor or major degree (I know sexuality is a spectrum, but this doesn't mean that 'straight' or 'gay' people don't exist.)\n\n-Same-sex experiences (either just kisses or beyond) between straight women have become increasingly common. VERY common. Like, I think most of them do it at least once.\n\n-'Lesbian' is the favorite porn category watched by straight women.\n\n-Having a threesome with another woman is one of their top 3 fantasies despite being straight.\n\nMany try to explain all this with this idea that a woman's body is inherently beatiful no matter who sees it and therefire it also attracts women. I strongly disagree: we know women are hot because men are attracted to them, that's all. Why, then, do almost all straight women appreciate the female body as well? Why are they much more likely to identify as 'bi' than men are? Well, that brings us to the first cause for that:\n\nThe oversexualization of women in society: EVERYWHERE (magazines, TV, films, social apps) you see women being sexualized. Objectified as sex symbols for men to enjoy for decades now. Of course males are responsible for this.\n\nSo it's only logical that if a girl grows up seeing women as a sexual symbol everywhere, she will eventually develop some degree of same-sex attraction, to the point she may be willing enough to try same-sex stuff. While growing up, her brain has been literally brainwashed into thinking 'women = sexy' despite the fact she's straight.\n\nSame-sex stuff between women is even encouraged by men because it's extremely sexy to the 'male gaze' (for example, men almost always fantasize about 2 women being together).\n\nIf men were instead the sexualized ones, then the idea of the male body being 'inherently beatiful no matter who sees it' would take root.\n\nOn the other hand, there’s the fact that women are much less stigmatized than men regarding sexuality. Two women sharing a kiss? 'They are just friends' Two MEN sharing a kiss? 'Obviously they are gay. Or bi'\n\nGirl friends can hold hands, caress each other, kiss each other in the cheek, etc. and all seems perfectly normal. But men doing that stuff? They are immediately labeled as effeminate or gay, etc.\n\nSo this 'freedom' (lack of social stigmatization) women enjoy regarding their sexuality, coupled with the obvious over sexualization of women in all existing media for decades, is driving heterosexual women to bisexuality.\n\nEven if the vast majority identifies as straight, they are all becoming increasingly bisexual in their behavior.\n\nPlease try to change my view 😊", "authorship": "human"}

The lid will have sharp edges which you will need to lift it by and risk cutting your hand. Additionally, the inside of the can will have sharp leftovers of the top pointing inwards which you can cut yourself on. Pro of using this method: you have more leverage to operate the device. Cons: more sharp edges, if lid isn't clean on top, you can get dirt in your food.\n\nIf you hold the can opener horizontally you are cutting into the side of the can, the lid comes off much easier since it doesn't need to be levered out, doesn't have as sharp of an edge, and doesn't fall into the food possibly contaminating it. The can itself will have a sharp edge pointing upwards, which is a negative. There is somewhat less leverage to operate the device, but for the most part these devices rely on a minimal amount of leverage in the first place so the disadvantage/advantage of leverage either way is negligible.", "authorship": "human"}
{"Article Number": 105, "title": "CMV: We should stop saying Old and New Testament, and instead say Hebrew and Christian Testament.", "article": "It really boils down to fighting Christian hegemony and supremacy.\n\nThe framing is deliberate to make Judaism (which doesn't follow the Christian Testament) look like it's the old outdated one and the Christian one (aka the New one) is the better one.  While it doesn't seem pejorative on it's face, the underlying implications is deliberately anti-Jewish.  The early church was very deliberately anti-Jewish and spoke of Jews being backwards and that their new revelation is the superior one.\n\nThis is still a narrative that is pushed today, that the Hebrew Testament is all violence and vengeance, and the Christian one is all mercy and forgiveness.  And that is not an accurate depiction of either testament.  There is plenty of mercy and forgiveness in the Hebrew Testament, and plenty of advocacy of violence and justification of violence in the Christian one.  I'm not trying to say they are the same, or the Hebrew testament isn't full of violence both active and proscribed as law.  Just that it isn't so cut and dry, and it has been a slander that has used as an excuse to be violent against Jews and attributed false violence and bloodlust to Jews [(the Blood libel) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel)as one big example of this\n\nAnd I'm not here to contest the antisemitism of the early (and modern) church.  Just to explain why the names were chosen as they were.\n\nMuslims refer to it not as the old and new testaments, but as the Tawrah (from the word Torah - what Jews call the 5 books of Moses) and Injil, which means gospel (as in the gospels of Jesus).  Even though they believe that the Quran supersedes the previous holy books, they are still canon and there is no pejorative connotation for either of them.\n\nThe only possible reason to continue to call it the Old Testament, is because the Christian Old Testament is different than the Tanakh (which is what Jews call it).  There are some books in a different order, and there are differences in a Christian translation than a Jewish one (there are different ten commandments according the the Tanakh and the Old Testament).   But that's why I think it should be referred to as the Hebrew Testament instead of the Tanakh or the Jewish Testament.  Because the Old Testament has unconscious negative connotations that upholds a Christian supremacy world view, and subtly pushes an anti-Jewish narrative.  Hebrew Testament and Christian Testament do not carry those same implications and it is still a separate thing than the Tanakh.\n\n  \n\\*Edit: I don't care about downvotes or my Karma score or whatever, but I'm wondering why nearly all my responses in this thread are getting downvoted?

Hence it is within the realm of reason for Americans to be be wary of Chinese agendas. (Again, I do not mean to be anti-Chinese.)\n\nHowever, in my opinion, all the arguments I have heard about Chinese social media also apply to American social media. From my perspective as a European, the USA is a foreign power led by a dangerously unpredictable right-wing extremist. Elon Musk (who controls Twitter) is a close Trump-supporter, and as far as I can tell Mark Zuckerberg (who controls Facebook) also supports Trump. I don't know about the owners of other major social media such as YouTube or Reddit, but I do not trust any of these people. Any of these might ally with Trump and use their platforms to spread propaganda to support a Trumpist ideology. That could cause a lot of damage to my country and others.\n\nIf Chinese-owned social media are dangerous, then American-owned social media are just as dangerous. Especially under Trump, but also without Trump. Hence, if it is reasonable for the US Congress to regulate or ban TikTok, then it is just as reasonable for European countries to regulate or ban American-owned social media such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and also Reddit. \n\n(One problem, of course, would be that there is not much left.

I recently found that this phenomenon is very hard to understand for me. I don't want to debate over the necessity of adopting inclusive language. I understand the need for native speakers to use gender-neutral language to promote equality. But it really brought me a lot of confusion.\n\nI learnt that the word \"man\" is for both male human and general human beings in my primary school. However, I now find that the genderless use seems outdated. The use of genderless man is inappropriate in modern English, so \"fireman,\" \"chairman,\" \"freshman,\" and \"unmanned\" all need to be changed to neutral words. But in this way, the \"man\" in \"woman\" is also genderless (it is from Middle English *mann*) and should also be replaced by some other words like \"female human,\" newly coined \"woperson,\" or the resurrected Middle English word \"wif\". It is inconsistent. (originally \"~~It seems like a paradox and makes no sense logically~~\" before OP editing it.)\n\nI have searched on the internet cannot find some theory to explain this phenomenon properly. If \"woman\" has been widely used and cannot be changed, words like \"fireman\", \"freshman\" were also widely used, why should changes be made? If the public has strong feelings for \"woman\", is it possible that firefighters also have feelings for the word \"fireman\", and college students will also miss their life in freshman year? Is this ignoring the emotions of these people?\n\nIs it a kind of compromise? Or just because the etymology origin of \"woman\" is less obvious than \"chairman\" for native speakers? If it retained the equivalent form \"wifeman\" of Middle English word \"wifmann\", would it be considered non-inclusive and get changed?\n\n\\--\n\nActually, the coexistence of male-specific \"man\" and \"woman\" that has \"man\" as a compound gives me a strong feeling of androcentrism and objectification. I am always very uncomfortable when using them, so I tend to use \"males\" and \"females\".\n\nI think it is the easiest solution to use the ungendered man, and a male word like resurrected \"weaponedman\" (or simplified \"wepman\", from Middle English wæpnedmann) or newly coined \"maleman\". In this way we could keep both \"woman\" and other words with the ungendered \"man\" as a compound, we just changed one word (the male word). Compared with the current solution in which almost all other words with genderless *man* are changed, it could minimize the impact.\n\n\\--\n\nNote: I am willing to change my view because I understand that I may have ignored some society and history knowledge of English countries due to lack of literatures (or just I did not find them).

After the Charlie Hebdo shootings on January 7th 2015 around 50 people were arrested for simply defending the attacks and even served months in jail.

Something that has been done for thousands of years has had a long impact on said community, so not allowing people to practice their religions can cause distress to some and other issues to billions to people. That is objective.\n\nWhat is not objective is bigoted beliefs surrounding gender, race, sexuality, those should not be allowed, no matter personal beliefs. It is a proven fact that homosexuality is observed in many species, that there is no setbacks surrounding it in terms of health and other things. It is wrong and unnecessary to claim that homosexuality, bisexuality etc. are abominations or unnatural. That should definitely be banned, no questions about it. So many countries have laws against Holocaust denial and yet not about saying such things about homosexuality? Homosexual men were killed during the Holocaust too, it is oppressive to them to say they are an abomination just like it is to say that to Jews.\n\nCriticism of religion should be allowed freely, as religion is observed in only one species, it has concrete, studied setbacks (higher rates of uneducation, war, general hatred, misogyny). Criticism of religion is oftenly done on objective grounds, meanwhile criticism of irreligion from a religious perspective is never objective, as it is based on outdated religious texts from thousands of years ago, and oftenly has an emotional tie to it.\n\nIf you are a decent, objective person, a law tomorrow banning hate speech will never impact YOUR free speech.

It makes no fucking sense at all in most countries.\n\nThe idea that the world's nations should be divided or united based merely on skin tone is a European concept which is only roughly 500 years old and was created/used initially to create a caste system for colonization of the Americas, the atlantic slave trade, and later conquest of Africa &amp; Asia. Before this time period, Europeans did not attempt to bond themselves together based on \"whiteness\" and ultimately couldn't, because it was bullshit. They still managed to start two of the most devastating wars in history just based on hating/fighting each other so much (as historically they always have).\n\nAfricans also had ZERO concept of being bonded based on \"blackness\" or even africaness until Europeans arrived and told them that's what they were. And if you look today many Africans are even moving away from the \"black\" label all together because its makes 0 sense for them. Historically they identified with their tribe or region and just like Europeans, would have no problems fighting their neighbors or someone they deemed to be an enemy (despite sharing the same skin tone). But westerners brainwashed with this modern historical revisionism that the whole world has always revolved around skin color will say stupid shit like \"Africans sold their own people\". No, they quite literally sold their enemies or war captives.\n\nBut one of the main problems I have with the continued widespread use of skin color as identifiers is the context in which that widespread use originated from. First off, we should point out the elephant in the room that very few people in the world are actually white or black. The people we call white are really pink-tannish and the people we call black are actually light to dark brown. In many European societies, \"darkness\" or \"black\" was a symbol of something evil or bad and \"white\" good. This is why in English we have terms like black magic, dark magic, white lie, etc. However, it wasn't until around the time of american colonization/slave trade that they began to apply these concepts to actual humans and label africans as 'black' to signify they were backwards and that they (the so-called 'white' people) were pure and everything a shade darker than that (including even some darker Europeans like Southern Italians) was not.\n\nNow, I understand these terms would be very hard to officially get rid of in the American continent, I'm well aware of the history of why color is is so important here. But even in countries like USA, it makes 0 sense. Africans and African-Americans check the same census box even though the difference culturally between an African and AA is enormous. Arabs &amp; North Africans are forced to check \"white\" despite many being a more brown-ish color and looking visibly different from Europeans, Mexicans despite mainly being mestizo are also forced to check \"white\" because there is no mestizo category, etc.\n\nI think it would make much more sense to just stop using skin color all together (on an official level) and just make distinctions PRIMARILY based on the country people are from (as we should be doing already) and secondarily the continents they trace their ancestry too (as opposed to their skin color). Maybe something like \"afro\" to separate afro-diaspora to actual Africans and Euro to do the same with Europeans, etc. Literally anything would make more sense than their skin color.\n\nOh also don't mistake my curse words here for anger, thats kinda just how I talk.\n\n\\*\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*\\* and just to clarify because I see a lot of comments mentioning this. I don't mean so much on a social level (i.e. there's a dark skin guy jogging across the street) Because obviously skin color is one of the first things you see when you see someone, again i'm not saying we should be blind.

The British exploited these cleavages by expending much more effort developing North Sudan than its southern section. \n\nOmar Al Bashir came to power in 1989 as an Islamic hardliner (crucifixion was put in the Sudanese criminal code under his regime which tells you everything) Sudan was the base of operations of Osama Bin Laden for some time. The genocide in Darfur occurred from 2003 to 2008. Darfur is also demographically distinct from the rest of northern Sudan, and more dark-skinned (in particular the Masalit tribe) and more ethnically diverse. When rebellions broke out in Darfur, Bashir sent in a militia called the Janjaweed whose role was to brutalise the population of Darfur, and estimated deaths for the genocide are 200,000-300,000. During the same time period, Bashir was committing ethnic cleansing by expelling civilians from oil rich areas of Southern Sudan so his troops could secure the oil fields and kill off the rebellion.\n\nIn 2004 the US secretary of state recognised the situation in Darfur as a genocide, so the US had sat back and let 200,000-300,000 die for point 1. \n\nThe second is that Sudan is still in a dire state because of the aftershocks of Bashir's regime. His economic mismanagement lasted until 2019, when he was toppled. He had kept his regime going through a ploy to prevent any military ouster (he split military power between the Sudanese military and the RSF, a paramilitary descended from the Janjaweed). However, these two came together to topple Bashir in 2019 and the military later launched a coup in 2021 that put them in control of the country (previously these was power sharing between civilian politicians and the Sudanese military). However, in 2023 civil war broke out as the Sudanese army under al-Burhan and the RSF under Lt. General Mohamed Hamdan's disagreement over when the RSF would be absorbed into the army exploded into open conflict. The war is still going on, with no end in sight.

Khartoum is in ruins, the map indicates no breakthrough victory from either side is possible, the war is being stoked by outside players like the UAE, mass migration threatens to destabilise fragile neighbours like Chad. And atrocities are happening once again in Darfur at the hands of the RSF (mass rapes, shelling of refugee camps, RSF fighters at the border crossing with Chad will club babies they identify as Masalit in order to \"prevent them growing up to fight us\").

{"Article Number": 115, "title": "CMV: South Korea cannot fix its birthrate crisis without a massive cultural shift.", "article": "The birthrate crisis in South Korea is a major issue, with it being way below the 2.1 replacement level at 0.74, and now I believe dipping into the 0.6 region. There are lots of reasons for this, and I've laid out 3 here, so here it goes:\n\n1. Most people in South Korea cannot afford to have kids. The cost of having a kid in South Korea is massive, and it doesn't help that you need private education, often times costing thousands of dollars a month in order for your kid to have a fair chance, which is another issue I'll touch upon later. The PIR for living in Seoul is[ 15.2](https://m.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20231222000484&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com). The average for most western countries is around a third to half that. And being in Seoul is practically mandatory in order to attend those private education facilities, as all the major teachers and facilities are in Seoul. The average person cannot afford to have a child, let alone buy a home.\n2. The people that can afford to have kids do not have time to raise them. South Korea is notorious for being a \"workaholic\" country, and it's true. There's extreme stress and resulting mental health problems. These people, while they can afford to have kids, do not have the time to raise them. Yes, you have maternity leave and things like that, but it still doesn't address the core problem. You just cannot take care of your kid if you have that tight and stressful of a work schedule.\n3. Why would you even want to raise your kid here? This is much more speculation than anything, so feel free to skip this part if you want. Life as a student in South Korea objectively sucks. There is so much stress and pressure in the South Korean education system, which results in a very high suicide rate in South Korea. An average student in South Korea (middle-high) attends multiple private education facilities a day, which all have classes ranging from 3 to 5 hours along with their respective homework. \"Vacations\" are seen as an opportunity to study like never before, rather than a chance to relax. It's not uncommon to spend 12 hours of your day roaming the Daechi district in private education facilities. You are actively encouraged to cut ties with friends starting even from middle school in some cases, and you have no time to do things you want like sports or clubs. This does not result in guaranteed success, either. There's people who do more but retake Korea's equivalent of the SAT for multiple years. A \"happy\" childhood is simply not possible in South Korea. And after all this, for males you have to go through conscription. Why would you want to put your kid through this?\n\nAn issue like this cannot be solved by increasing maternity leave or increasing payout to people that have kids. A complex problem cannot be solved by a simple solution. These are all cultural and economic issues rooted into the country. Being a \"workaholic\" and the private education problems all don't have real answers and the government's attempts at fixing this, well, has not been successful.\n\nThere are a few points I haven't talked about, like the 4B movement and all of it's related issues, but I did not want to delve into that. Feel free to look it up if you want to. For context, I'm a South Korean national in Middle School and I just wanted to articulate my thoughts. There's certainly some bias involved but happy CMVing\n\n  \nEDIT: I see some comments about the trend reversing and that there is no guarantee it will keep falling even more. So I'm addressing those here rather than replying to each comment individually. The issue with that is that the majority of the people alive are old, and they aren't getting younger. There are more 80-year-olds than 1-year-olds. The main risk as I see it is that people get older faster than the trend reverses, and thus the country is unable to support them. I don't know if you've seen the population pyramid for Korea, but it's pretty horrendous. ", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 121, "title": "CMV: You Can’t Be Racist and a Christian at the Same Time ", "article": "\n\n\nAs a Christian, I believe that racism and Christianity are fundamentally incompatible. Christianity is built on the teachings of Jesus Christ, who emphasized love, humility, and treating others as we would want to be treated. Racism, on the other hand, is rooted in hatred, prejudice, and the belief that one group of people is superior to another—a mindset that directly contradicts the core tenets of the faith.\n\nThe Bible teaches that all humans are made in the image of God (Genesis 1:27), and the New Testament makes it clear that there is no room for discrimination:\n\n\"There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\" (Galatians 3:28)\n\n\"Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar.\" (1 John 4:20)\n\n\nWhen we accept Christ, we are called to reflect His love and grace in our interactions with others, regardless of race, culture, or background. Racism, however, thrives on exclusion and division—values that directly oppose the unity and inclusion Christ preached.\n\nFurthermore, Jesus Himself broke cultural barriers during His time on earth, engaging with Samaritans, tax collectors, and other marginalized groups that society rejected. His ministry consistently challenged racial and societal divisions, and as His followers, we are called to do the same.\n\nYet, throughout history, there have been Christians who have either tolerated or perpetuated racism. This deeply saddens me because it not only misrepresents Christ’s teachings but also drives people away from the faith. Christianity should never be used to justify racism; doing so is a perversion of the Gospel.\n\nIf you’re a Christian and harbor racist beliefs, I believe it’s worth asking: Are you truly reflecting Christ in your actions and mindset? If the answer is no, then something needs to change.\n\nI welcome differing views on this, as I’m open to hearing how others reconcile faith with actions or beliefs that may contradict it. But for me, Christianity without love for all people simply isn’t Christianity.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

{"Article Number": 122, "title": "cmv: many people online, especially on Reddit are unreasonable about COVID", "article": "I would like to preface this by saying I was never a covid denier or anything like that. I got vaccinated and the booster, and when it was required I always wore a mask. Even after requirements dropped I still wore it in hospitals and when I was sick. I do also know people who got COVID and some who died, so I take the virus seriously.   \n\nTherefore, I think I should be allowed to call out the number of people on reddit who still fear monger about covid and its honestly worrying. What spurred this was recently a saw a post about some of the long term issues that can be caused by covid, such as difficulty concentrating and exhaustion, and the precautions people can take to avoid this. They used the umbrella term long covid which I have heard floating around before but never did much research into.\n\nI originally thought long covid was a disease, Its not, wikipedia describes it as a syndrome and states that the cause is not really known. More importantly, many of the symptoms of \"long covid\" to me have nothing to do with covid. They state things like difficulty concentrating, fatigue, lack of motivation, mental health issues like anxiety/ depression and some other things. Like guys, I am not a medical professional but seeing as long COVID is not a disease, I think you have it wrong. The reason you could see yourself feeling more sick and tired after covid is because you were not able to exercise and had to quarantine while in covid, therefore making you feel worse, especially as you were likely not eating well during this time. If you then get into a cycle and continue to eat poorly and be sedentary you will not feel well even after recovering.\n\nThings like lack of attention span and mental health issues can also be because you had to quarantine and had to be locked in your room by yourself and spent all day doom scrolling and stuff. Obviously i am not talking about auto immune disease which is an actual problem.\n\nThe reason this post and discussion as a whole especially annoyed me is because of how they said it should be handled. They said the solution to this is for people to start wearing masks and social distancing again, or even quarantining. Again, I wore masks during covid and recommend sick people still do, but the fact that Long COVID is not well understood and people are suggesting such drastic measures is borderline psuedo science in my opinion COVID was a major pandemic, yet it is no longer classified as a pandemic and we need to learn to adapt as a society. We did not live in a permanent state of lockdown due to any other pandemic, yet this is what these long COVID fear mongers are suggesting.\n\nNot to get personal but I was in highschool when COVID started, and of course had to deal with lockdowns for about 2 years. It was an incredibly difficult period for me and even after lockdowns passed I had many issues both health and mentally due to being locked down for so long, I noticed people around me and society also being affected. Which is part of the reason why I think discussion around long COVID is not based on the actual virus, especially as doctors don't know much about it yet. Many long COVID fearmongers say stuff like i'm going to start quarantining myself and going out less. This is why I think this discussion is downright dangerous, you not being able to go out while sick is part of the reason for your fatigue.\n\nCOVID had a major impact on society, it killed millions, and effected billions mentally and physically, not to mention drastically effecting the economy which has ramifications to this day. So please, do not suggest people start locking down again due to \"long covid\", which is a syndrome doctors know little about. Especially as many of the symptoms are likely not caused by covid, but rather due to people not being able to live healthily while sick.", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 126, "title": "CMV: All government contracts (including defense and infrastructure) should be randomly assigned by lottery to random individuals.", "article": "Okay, typically government contracts are assigned by a bidding process or through competition. Trouble is that it can be rigged and it encourages corruption as companies (especially defense companies) try to line the pockets of politicians who try to make sure that whoever is backing them wins. This results in procurement controversies where a more worthy entry is won by the lowest bidder or the one with the most connections to the government.\n\nWhile a government owned corporation could prevent lining pockets of politicians during elections, it has problems with inefficiency and too big to fail as they are part of the government and they would be backed up by the government, resulting in waste. In addition, corruption is also a problem here as civil servants can siphon off funds\n\nSo, the solution. Random lottery for government contracts to individuals. Basically rather than issuing out contracts to companies, the government issues out a contract by to a random individual, regardless of any qualifying factor such as age or income. To prevent people from just selling or transferring the contracts to companies, they are non transferrable and it's illegal to sell them. Once the contract is randomly assigned to a person, they are compelled under pain of death or life imprisonment to make a company to either provide utilities or design and make the product. Oh, and they would have to raise funds to set up the company from their own pockets under their name. The individuals would either pay from their own pocket money or use crowdfunding like Patreon and Kickstarter to jumpstart the company.\n\nAnd it applies for all government contracts, ranging from infrastructure to nuclear weapons production. So rather than assigning a nuclear weapon production line to a well established defense contractor, the lottery system would assign nuclear weapon production to anyone to give an example. So,yes, you can have a child in school using Patreon or Kickstarter to fund a company to make nuclear weapons for the government to give an example.\n\nThis would rip out the issue of kickbacks as the contracts are randomly given to individuals rather than being bidded or assigned and would encourage private enterprise since the individual that are randomly assigned the contract have to use or raise their own money to produce products or provide infrastructure.\n\nBut who checks the lottery body? Well, infinite regress for auditing. One body will audit another body and so on that are also randomly selected to prevent corruption. The auditors would check on the body responsible for the lottery and each other, helping provide a check and balance to the lottery body.\n\nCMV.", "authorship": "human"}

By developing nations, I don't mean the economic classification of developing nations, but rather those that are rapidly undergoing large societal shifts and cultural upheaval, places such as Kenya, Nigeria, India. My perspective is that in many cultural sectors, the US and Europe have absolute dominance that makes it extremely difficult for indigenous movements to compete once introduced. I am all for globalisation and in some respects homogenisation, but my main problem is that the values or ideas we are introducing may not be compatible with the local cultures or environments, and may lead to detrimental results down the road, or lead to the erosion of cultures outright.\n\nAs many of these nations develop economically, entering the third or fourth phase of demographic transition, they are developing the markets and demand for a larger variety of goods and other services. During this process, western and other cultures organically grew and experimented, developing solutions and ideas that suited them and their communities. However it is ever becoming more apparent, that in many places especially in the english speaking world, they will not be getting this chance as our cultural exports will immediately begin to fill up these niches. For instance instead of the chance to experiment with their own architectural styles as cities begin to lay down their first skyscrapers, they will be getting giant glass and metal dick shaped obelisks in the middle of a desert. As you might notice, Dubai, Kuwait etc lack a strong identity and have other issues, some pertaining to the fact that maybe glass is reflective and steel tends to overheat in a desert. \n\nNot only that, but more importantly, we are stunting their political progress. On this topic, perhaps we are going beyond cultural influence but rather direct influence. I'd argue that anyone by now should have realised, that making certain developing nations adopt full western style liberal democracy is a fat mistake.  Even moreso when copying word for word British/French/American systems in, that are utterly mismatched with the local culture and political situation. \n\nI'd argue that part of the reason why western democracies are so successful is that we've had to room to figure out what uniquely works for us, an opportunity that we are denying to the nations that are still developing their political structures if we shoe in democracy right now. Switzerland's referendum system would not work in the France. My country's mandatory voting system would not work as well in say, Spain. France's hybrid presidential/parliamentary system would also not work as well in the UK.

While Somalia has struggled with constant instability and extremist groups like al-Shabaab, Somaliland has quietly built a democratic government, held peaceful elections, and maintained stability in one of the toughest neighborhoods on Earth. The people there voted for independence, they’ve got their own constitution, their own military, and they’re running things better than most recognized countries in the region. Plus, its location is a huge deal. Somaliland sits right on the Gulf of Aden, one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, where about 12% of global trade passes through, including oil heading to Europe and beyond. Their port in Berbera is growing fast, with help from international investment, and could become a game-changer for trade and logistics. For the world, recognizing Somaliland could mean having a new partner in a strategic spot, close to key military operations anyways, lol. On top of that, Somaliland’s been a stronghold against terrorist groups, making it a stable ally in a chaotic region. There are also plenty of economic opportunities, from untapped oil and minerals to trade partnerships, that businesses and the country itself could benefit from. Supporting Somaliland just makes sense—it aligns with values of democracy and stability, strengthens regional security, and opens doors for future cooperation. It’s a win-win.

Almost all governments agree that there is a serious problem, and if they are able, taking measures to mitigate the problem. Europe is already almost neutral, and all the big economies are trying to limit emissions massively. It will only get better from now on.\n2. For me the most important point: Stratospheric Aerosol Injection. Relatively small amounts of chemicals released in the stratosphere to shield the earth from the sun and cool it down significantly. There is a lot of research already in this field with many test runs and data on safety and efficiency. So even if governments will fail and the 1. point is moot, science will come to the rescue and sort it out.\n\nI almost never see point 2 being discussed even though it is basically the great solution.\n\nSo I'm not expecting massive areas of land being uninhabitable, cities going underwater and huge waves of migration because of global warming.

{"Article Number": 142, "title": "CMV: The U.S. (probably) can buy Greenland, and it should do so.", "article": "Let's start with the latter proposition -- the basic case for buying Greenland should be facially obvious to most. Greenland is a very large (if not quite as large as on a Mercator projection) area, with vast amounts of natural resources that have largely been untapped. It occupies a strategic position as a gateway to the Artic, being the closest point in North America to Europe and the bulk of hostile navies originating there (e.g., Russian European naval forces). Both of these factors will increase in importance and value substantially over the coming years as global warming progressing. Importantly, with (hopefully) no end-date to the benefits, the investment has quite a long runway to yield a net benefit.\n\nSome likely objections (and responses) to the benefits:\n\n&gt; Greenland is controlled by an ally already; the U.S. does not need to control it personally for these benefits.\n\nWhile it is true that Denmark is currently an ally of the U.S., the assumption that this is an unending state of affairs is hopelessly naive. Allies come and go more frequently than an integrated area.\n\nYes, the U.S. could likely take Greenland in the scenario that a renegade Denmark threatens to allow it to threaten the U.S., but there are two issues: 1) Many scenarios exist where hostile/ambivalent ownership of Greenland harms U.S. security but would not justify a military intervention, and 2) any such military seizure would inevitably be more violent than a peaceful purchase.\n\n&gt; Any such purchase will alienate Denmark and contribute to further breakdown of global norms against territory seizures\n\nI believe my (coming) proposal on purchase strategy would make this unlikely to occur - Denmark may still protest, but it would have a difficult time maintaining legitimacy in attempting to prevent the purchase or be overly upset. To the extent Denmark is sufficiently angry by a successful purchase to cause a break in relations, I do not think it would cause a break in relations with other allies. And without Greenland... Denmark wouldn't be a particularly important ally anyways. \n\nTo the extent global norms would be upset, I do not think my proposal would provide much justification for truly negative behavior.\n\nThink about how much good the money could do here at home! You have to weigh the benefits against if it was spent to improve long term outcomes for our citizens.\n\nYeah, but let's be real, will it? Even under a Democratic president? Color me skeptical.\n\n---\n\nOkay, so what's the proposal? This is simple. We're going to overpay by the standards of the Louisiana or Alaska purchases, but that's fine. Yeah, yeah, the governments of Denmark and Greenland say it's not for sale. That's fine. They're not in charge.\n\nGreenland is, shockingly, a democracy. More specifically, it's a democracy made up of only 56,000 people. Why would we talk to the governments when we can go directly to them?\n\nFirst offer: $1,000,000. Each. They get to keep their autonomy, local governance, everything, if they want (subject to the Constitution, of course). They can also choose to be folded into a state (probably Maine for sheer geographical sense) if they prefer. Or wait for a higher population. If they want to leave Greenland to stay a part of Denmark or move elsewhere in the U.S. or world, we'll pay for a first-class ticket for them and buy their property in Greenland at current market rate (if they want).\n\nThat would cost us ~$56 billion (let's say $57 billion to be safe, even though the perks are mostly a rounding error). At $10k/acre that is, of course, a substantially worse deal in raw terms than our previous purchases, but... so be it? We're also way richer and way bigger than we were in 1860. And as a result, it is also... ~1% of our national budget... for one year. A rounding error. There will need to be subsidies to Greenland (for a while), but those will be even more of a rounding error - $650 mil/year (based off of Denmark's current amount). And that's only until the oil companies and migrants get there. I won't claim Alaska, as an example, is some great contributor to the Federal government, but it's still paying in more than it receives.\n\nIf the vote is a no, we raise it to $2 million per person. If a no again, $4 million. I probably wouldn't want to go much further, but I think anything up to a one-time expense of 5% of our budget is fine.\n\n---\n\nWhat would change my view? A few thoughts:\n\n* Clear evidence or line of reasoning to show that Greenlanders would not or could not force a vote if offered $4 million each. (I am pretty skeptical for either point. Most likely to change on the first, but I don't think you'll find polling to that effect).\n\n* A clear line of reasoning that this would cause a major breakdown of U.S. relations/international order. Pretty skeptical on this again - it feels like this proposal would be difficult to argue against on liberal grounds &amp; it doesn't feel like it presents a major threat of increasing violence. Increasing voluntary purchases of territory seems... fine. Even potentially beneficial by forefronting a release valve other than war. \n\n* Clear evidence/line of evidence that the U.S. would never recoup its investment in benefits. This is probably impossible in full form, taking into account near-unpredictable geopolitical benefits.

There are more American soldiers than Danes on the island, Despite Denmark initially refusing to host the Americans.\n\nI don't think America will ever leave. As an American, I believe the United States will only leave if it no longer sees a reason to keep control; if there's no interest, we will go home. But America's interest in Greenland isn't economic or a defense. Greenland has been something American politicians wanted for Ideological reasons. America has seen Greenland (and other European colonies in the new world) as immoral and oppressive intrusions into America's sphere of influence. The idea that America is a \"guardian of liberty\" for the rest of the hemisphere has been ingrained into our identity since the beginning.

But what if it can be controlled ? I think you can actually control it through the legal system through regulation (only harm the persons involved in the crime, not their family members) would be beneficial to justice.\n\nFirstly, it would empower individuals in the community when victims involved get to decide the proportion of the punishment to criminals. Sure, there's the problem of disproportionate retribution (like getting tortured to death for shoplifting) , but hey it's more satisfying for the community when victims get to create their own punishments on the criminal themselves rather than leaving it to a guideline. If people find that the punishment is too disproportionate, ask the person involved in carrying out the retribution, not the legal system. The legal system in my system would only concern itself mostly with investigating, catching  and giving criminals a fair trail, not sentencing.\n\nSecondly, controlling revenge would prevent vendetta from happening. If you have rules for revenge such as don't harm family members of criminals that are not directly involved, it would prevent feuds from happening since if the family members of their criminals are forbidden from pulling off retribution on the victim off to avenge their crime, blood feuds won't happen. If they do so, they would be punished under the law.\n\nThirdly, it's quite satisfying to see victims take revenge on those that tormented them and send a message to criminals (helping deter crime) and would help to streamline the court process since under this system, there are no appeals or jails (which take up maintenance expenses).\n\nNow about issues:\n\nWhat about rehabilitation? Rehab is expensive. Why waste taxpayers money on jails when you can just immediately execute or take revenge on the criminal on the spot when the trial is concluded. Saves on money that can be used for stuff like healthcare and infrastructure.\n\nSpeeding or traffic offenses? Still a fine.\n\nCorruption and tax evasion? Death (on the spot) with all assets owned (including internal organs) being sold off on the open market for free.\n\nWhat about those who don't like to take revenge: Force them under pain of death.

I am not trying to argue that sexualization *can't* objectify women, but that it doesn't necessarily do that.\n\nEven in contexts like pornography, where women are depicted primarily in terms of their sexual role, this does not automatically constitute objectification. Treating someone as a utility or focusing on a specific aspect of their being (such as their sexuality) is not the same as *only* treating them as a utility and denying the existence of their individuality or broader humanity.\n\nIf we were to equate being valued for a particular function with objectification, then many common societal roles would also qualify as objectifying. For example, your job values you for the labor or skills you provide, your school values you for your ability to learn and achieve, and your relationships may sometimes emphasize particular roles, such as emotional support or companionship. \n\nYet, none of these inherently reduce you to just those functions, they are specific contexts in which certain aspects of your personhood are prioritized without negating your individuality. Similarly, in the realm of pornography, a woman may be portrayed in a way that emphasizes her sexuality, but this doesn't mean she is inherently stripped of her personhood. \n\nThis portrayal operates within a specific context, entertainment centered around sexual arousal, and does not necessarily imply that she has no agency, individuality, or value outside that context. \n\nA common counterargument might be that many men who consume pornography view women solely as sexual objects, stripping them of any other value. While it’s true that some individuals may internalize harmful perceptions, this is a reflection of the viewer’s mindset rather than the intrinsic nature of pornography itself. \n\nMedia consumption is always mediated by the attitudes and beliefs of the audience. Someone predisposed to dehumanizing women may project objectifying attitudes onto what they watch, but this does not mean the medium inherently causes or requires such a mindset.\n\n**In essence, pornography/media depicting women being sexualized doesn't inherently objectify them. While it might be true that some consumers of this kind of media merely think of women as objects, the media itself doesn't necessarily promote that.**", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 163, "title": "CMV: The essence of traditional family or traditional roles will never disappear no matter how much progressive our society is or intend to be in the future. It will always remain within our society", "article": "I believe that the traditional family, or at least the essence of it, is deeply ingrained in human nature rather than merely being a product of societal norms as most people want us to believe. By definition, a traditional family is one in which the man takes on the role of the provider and breadwinner, ensuring the family’s financial security and resources, while the woman fulfills a nurturing role, taking care of children, managing household responsibilities, and supporting family well-being.\n\nHistorically, this dynamic was the norm for the human society for many years ago, particularly in the 18th, 19th and early 20th. While these roles are often seen as outdated today, societal progress has brought significant changes. Women now have the freedom to step outside traditional roles, pursuing careers, ambitions, and opportunities that were once denied to them. This progress is something I am proud of, as it allows individuals to make choices that align with their personal goals and aspirations.\n\nHowever, I am far more convinced that the essence of these traditional roles persists in ways that suggest they are more than just constructs of societal expectations. They appear to be rooted in human nature itself. Men, for instance, continue to feel an innate pressure to provide for their families, even in modern, progressive societies. While women can choose to embrace traditional roles, pursue careers, or even balance both, men rarely feel the same level of freedom to step away from their role as providers. Today, women can choose to be stay-at-home mothers, working professionals, or a combination of both. They are free to redefine what it means to be a woman in the context of family life. However, for men, the same flexibility is not as prevalent. The notion of a man choosing to be a stay-at-home father while his wife takes on the role of breadwinner is still relatively uncommon, and I think it is an exception rather than the norm. for example, only 5% of families in the United States have a stay-at-home father\n\nsource: [https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/03/almost-1-in-5-stay-at-home-parents-in-the-us-are-dads/](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/03/almost-1-in-5-stay-at-home-parents-in-the-us-are-dads/)\n\nN.B:  I did not think I would need to drop research or some statistics to state an obvious fact, but we never know these days. Also, this is the most recent research I found, and I could have provided many but at the end of the day my view still remains the same\n\nThis discrepancy highlights something fundamental that is overlooked by many: the roles of provider and nurturer are not interchangeable in the same way for men and women. Men are often expected, by themselves and others, to be financially independent, emotionally stable, and reliable as protectors and leaders. Similarly, many women, even those who reject traditional norms, still gravitate toward partners who can provide security, stability, and support. Even in situations where women are the primary earners, it is often anecdotal rather than reflective of a broader trend. This suggests that the traditional family dynamic, while adaptable, is still deeply embedded in our collective psyche.\n\nMost of the critics I heard against this is they are relics of a bygone era, biased and cliche. Yet this critique seems to overlook an important reality and fact: if a woman chooses to embrace a traditional role, she inherently seeks a partner who embodies complementary traits namely, a man who is a provider, leader, and protector. These roles are not interchangeable because they fulfill specific needs that have been fundamental to human relationships for centuries. The very freedom that allows women to choose whether to be traditional or modern relies on the existence of men willing to fulfill the traditional male role. A woman who wants to be a stay-at-home mother cannot do so without a partner who takes on the role of provider. In this sense, traditional roles are not obsolete; they remain an essential part of the dynamic that allows such choices to exist. And please do not come at me and say that you know X family or whatever where it is different. This is again an exception to the rule.\n\nThe persistence of these roles in a context of traditional family is not simply due to societal conditioning. Biological, psychological, and evolutionary factors play a significant role. Men often derive a sense of purpose and fulfillment from providing and protecting, while women are biologically inclined toward nurturing and caregiving, particularly during the child-rearing years. I am not saying that they are restrained from only these traits. Men also have a fulfillment for caregiving and women on the reverse side or both of them having both which is completely normal. But I am talking in general. Men and women are wired differently in ways that complement each other, and these differences form the foundation of the traditional family structure.\n\nNow I am going to counter some upcoming counter arguments:\n\n**1)You said that men feel pressure to step away from being providers, is it not due to societal pressure therefore a construct of society**\n\n**2) It is a cliche and outdated to think that women tend more into nurturing and caregiving roles. Society has evolved and give the possibility to be more than that so stop it**\n\nIt’s important to understand that societal pressure and biology reinforce each other. While I think societal expectations do play a role in shaping behaviors, they frequently stem from biological tendencies that have evolved over thousands of years. The complementary roles between men and women are deeply rooted in our evolutionary history. In early human societies, survival was heavily dependent on a division of labor. Men, generally possessing greater physical strength and endurance, took on the responsibilities of hunting, fishing, and performing tasks that required exposure to danger. These roles ensured the provision of resources and protection for their families. Women, by contrast, assumed nurturing roles, focusing on the care and survival of children, managing the household, and ensuring emotional stability. This division of roles was not arbitrarily assigned but driven by necessity. Over generations, these patterns of behavior were reinforced, not only culturally but also biologically, as traits like physical strength and risk-taking became associated with men, while nurturing instincts and multitasking were more closely linked to women.\n\nEven in today’s developed societies, where survival is not much a concern, these traits relatively remain evident. Men disproportionately take on physically demanding, high-risk jobs such as construction, firefighting, and military service. These same traits such as leadership, decisiveness, and stability also naturally manifest in family dynamics. A man’s role as a provider, protector, and leader within the family mirrors his historical responsibilities, making these behaviors more than mere societal constructs.\n\nOn the other hand, women today have greater freedom to pursue various roles, blending traditional nurturing responsibilities with professional ambitions. While societal progress has allowed for this flexibility, the fundamental complementary nature between men and women remains intact. As I said earlier, a woman who chooses to embrace traditional motherhood typically seeks a partner who fulfills the role of provider, leader, and protector. These roles, while adaptable, are not interchangeable in their essence because they fulfill deeply ingrained needs on both sides. To claim that traditional family roles are entirely the product of societal pressure dismisses the biological and evolutionary context that shaped these roles over millennia. I agree that societal norms may amplify or suppress certain behaviors, but they do not create them from nothing. Biology provides the foundation, and culture builds upon it. This does not mean that people must conform to traditional roles. Society today allows individual to define their own paths. However, the persistence of traditional roles even in modern societies makes me believe that they are rooted in something deeper than societal expectations alone. and will remain the main core of the family dynamic\n\n  \n**EDIT\\_My View has changed**: Thank you for your replies. Upon reflecting on some comments, I realized I had more to consider regarding the evolution of family structures and the balance between biological and societal factors. Also, my time frame seems to have been misused. Initially, I previously focused on the idea of traditional gender roles, especially men as providers and women as nurturers, based on biological tendencies and historical precedents. However, as some of you pointed out in the comment section, both men and women have historically played varied roles across cultures and time periods, and the family model has been much more flexible than I originally assumed. I now see that in ancient times, the family unit wasn't necessarily nuclear, and roles within it were often shared or fluid, influenced by factors like availability of resources, community, and need rather than fixed expectations. Also, the development of society, and modern medicine has significantly reduced the need for strict division of labor, allowing for much more equality in household responsibilities today. While I think there are still biological aspects at play in these interactions, I understand that societal pressures and expectations have had a major influence on shaping the roles we associate with men and women. In a more interconnected world, families no longer operate in isolation, and many types of family structures whether traditional, progressive, or communal can thrive depending on the circumstances. I would say to conclude that men and women are free to live how they see fit. It is up to both of them to choose the family dynamic that are suited for them without any societal pressure.

{"Article Number": 164, "title": "CMV: Democracy is not always a better system than dictatorship in any given country", "article": "When I have political discussions, I often encounter an unsurprising but still curious affinity for democracy and corresponding disgust for dictatorship. I have a rather disorganised assortment of thoughts here so I'll just do a list:\n\nA) there are nations where dictatorship has been the system for hundreds of years, and there's a rich vein of competent leaders there. Emperor Wu of the Han Chinese dynasty doubled the size of the empire and conducted a brilliant campaign to push back the Xiongnu to the north, who were constantly raiding Chinese territory. The Han started to come apart at the seams in fact when there was no longer a strong hand in the form of a credible emperor pulling the strings.\n\nB) as with colonialism, the discourse seems to extremely imbalanced with it being a commonality for none of the positives to be recognised. I have a Spanish friend who said this quite well, that when the Spanish went over the New World the Aztecs were carrying out human sacrifices, and the Spanish also brought universities to Mexico. The university was a colonial institution. The same with the British Empire, they have a ruinous legacy in Africa but nobody seems to mention that Hong Kong was an irrelevant speck on the map probably unknown to even the Chinese emperor at the time but it was the British who made it into a global financial hub.\n\nC) the opinion on dictatorship is skewed by Hitler, who was demonstrably much more cruel than any figure going back centuries. Historian Volker Ullrich in his (very excellent book) on Hitler says that while Hitler was expansionist like Napoleon the two cannot really be compared because while Napoleon left a positive legacy in terms of the Napoleonic code, Hitler was death as means and end.\n\nD) for one example, the reason Egypt had no civil war after colonialism and Algeria did is because Algerian political players viewed the Islamist parties as convenient for their political advancement, which lent them too much power until they had a base for a civil war. Meanwhile in Egypt dictator Hosni Mubarak had tight security laws that prevented radical Islamism from ever having power like it did in Algeria. Also note Egypt is not torn apart by Islamism like countries in the Sahel are.\n\nE) Discourse on specific dictatorships also tends to be extremely imbalanced. From 1990 to 2015, more people were lifted out of poverty than in any 25 year period in recorded history. A large proportion of this stemmed from China. China also has very low crime rates, and you can be safe at night in a major Chinese city and it would be hard to say the same for San Francisco or London. China also does a much more effective job of public transport than, say, the UK where I live. China also has consistently strong economic growth rates, even in 2023 when the news was filled with talk of China's supposed economic disaster the GDP grew by 5%.\n\nF) Even the brutal dictatorships tend to have at least some rewarding aspects, whilst there's plenty of democratic governments I see right now that are a calamity through and through. A major reason Taiwan is so prosperous right now is because it adopted the colonial Japanese governance structures.\n\nG) Western attempts to export democracy to other countries have been calamitous (Iraq)\n\nH) A hatred of dictatorial regimes usually actually harms the people of the nation whilst not changing any governance practices. For example, Myanmar's economy has been stunted for decades because Western desire for regime change has meant citizens of Myanmar receive drastically lower aid per person than other countries in the region.\n\nI) a large proportion of dictatorships that have had negative rulers have had them because of flawed succession. This is most obvious with the Roman Empire, where the eminently competent Marcus Aurelius was succeeded by the infinitely profligate Commodus, just because Commodus was related to the late emperor. The Roman Empire had many brilliant emperors but also many calamitous emperors, because of this failure to have a very good succession system.\n\nJ) Some of the most successful countries in Africa right now are dictatorships, such as Rwanda under Kagame, which has recorded 8-10% GDP growth a year under his tenure (beginning in 2000) and Kigali is one of the cleanest and safest cities in Africa. Which is especially impressive given his rule began just six years after one of the worst genocides in history.\n\nK) Sometimes dictatorship and a strong hand is needed to hold together a country either after or during a catastrophe. Cambodia could well have collapsed after the Cambodian genocide, which wiped out 25% of the population, and maybe the 38 year tenure of Hun Sen prevented this? I don't know, but it's certainly possible. A major reason China collapsed into the warlord era is because there was no longer any strong or credible government holding together such a vast country. I suspect China would collapse once again if it ever became a democracy.", "authorship": "human"}

My friends and acquaintances who are vegan have a mixture of three beliefs about the lifestyle that they mostly keep to themselves about unless asked:\n\n1. Personal health. They believe that the vegan diet is more healthy for the human who is vegan.\n\n2. Animal cruelty. They want to avoid contributing to the pain of animals, so they don't eat them or use their products.\n\n3. The environmental impact. They point out the harm that factory farming does to the environment and don't partake.\n\n1 isn't really a moral position in my opinion because it's about how one wants to treat their own body and I believe we mostly can do whatever we like with our own bodies, so there isn't any morally superior way to go about that.\n\n2 is contestable depending on how you feel about what constitutes animal cruelty and the sentience of animals.

We have to grow a lot of grain to feed the animals we eat (far more than if we were growing grain for our own consumption), animals create pollution (cows and methane for example), and they pollute the water with their waste runoff. By not eating them or using their products, you reduce how much you personally contribute to climate change, which is the morally superior position in a world where everyone needs to reduce their carbon footprint if we are to stave off environmental destruction. \n\nPart of this post was influenced by a recent post on Reddit about vegans where tired tropes were brought out about how vegans cannot completely avoid animal harm but reducing the impact is still better than not reducing the impact even if there remains some negative impact.", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 167, "title": "CMV: People should be accorded democratic civil rights to the degree that they demonstrate the mental capacity to \"properly\" participate.", "article": "I'll start by saying I know this is a controversial argument, but I have yet to encounter a truly convincing argument against it.\n\nThe core argument is that in order to engage *properly* in a democratic civil society, participants must have a certain level of mental capacity to (to *some extent*) engage in civil discourse, comprehend policies and their consequences, and make decisions that involve the interaction between one's values and the knowledge gained during civic engagement. These activities require some kinds of mental ability - perhaps cognitive abilities like comprehension, executive functioning, or emotional regulation, and so on. People who are incapable of engaging in these activities (or who are unmotivated to because of these limitations) but participate civilly (e.g., vote) make bad decisions, thus going about civil society *improperly* and ruining it for everyone else. Therefore, such people need to have a reduced right to civil participation, at least until they gain or regain these capacities. Further, the more capacity the participants have, the better the decisions they make, so the greater the influence they should have.\n\nNow to the notes:\n\n1. Notice that I left the threshold vague. This is intentional because I know that one response will be \"but where should the line be drawn\"? I think as long as that you agree that there is *some* threshold, even if we don't know *where* exactly it is, then you must agree with that aspect of my argument. I think an argument that would convince me on this end would have to show that NONE of those capacities are needed to ANY extent for a healthy civil society, which I am doubtful anyone can prove to be true. I am arguing theoretically here, not practically (yet).\n\n2. Civil societies already tend to be structured in ways that align with this argument. For instance, every democracy that comes to mind has a minimum voting age, which I believe comes from the argument that we require people to be \"mature\" enough to be able to make good decisions from themselves, such as vote. Of course, in practice, some people who are age-eligible to vote certainly do not act maturely enough in their voting behavior. So if you think these policies are correct, you must show in your argument how they are compatible with your refutation to my argument. With people with intellectual disabilities, in the US the ADA states that only people who can \"understand what it means to vote\" are eligible to participate.\n\n3. Another argument that would convince me is if you could break the chain between \"has greater (or sufficient) capacities\" and \"votes *better* and engages in civil society more properly\". You would need to show that  voting behavior is not significantly better if the voter's mental capacities are better. Presumably, some kind of empirical evidence from behavioral science or some kind of political philosophy argument that nullifies the notion of \"better\"/\"properly\" By \"better\"/\"properly\", my best shot at defining it would be something like \"behavior that is more aligned with the political interests and values of the participant that are clear and concrete to said participant\".\n\n4. I have heard counterarguments before that \"come from the heart\", and I have not been convinced by them. In that sense, I suppose that I come from the general idea that people who are incapable of making good decisions should not be empowered to make decisions, even if losing this autonomy would make them (and others) feel bad about it.\n\n5. I think that this disenfranchisement should be consistently reevaluated across the person's lifespan. If someone gains or regains this requisite level of capacity, they should be afforded the same rights others at the level would get. One's history on this front should have no bearing on their current level of enfranchisement, since what matters is what they can do with those capacities NOW to participate properly.\n\nI hold this belief quite awkwardly precisely because I know how distasteful it is to many people - and how morally objectionable it would be to implement it if I am wrong - and so I would like to see it changed. Thanks for reading.\n\nEdit: as u/FearlessResource9785 correctly pointed out, my view here is that the threshold I mentioned is not nearly as vague as I thought it was - it is most certainly above and beyond what we currently have in many societies, which is where a court deems a person unfit to vote.", "authorship": "human"}

In modern days most white countries would gladly accept immigrants and politically and socially they have dedicated laws and resources that are meant to help immigrants. Since the majority of white countries have a history of colonizing the world, modern history and social culture focus a lot on the sentiment of accepting people who are different than you, or simply the idea of racial/ethnic diversity and inclusion when it comes to representation and treatment. The school system or general education emphasizes on that, and all the organizations and firms would also follow and do the same(even if they have ulterior motive/not being genuine). As long as you grow up in a modern environment, you will learn about racism and that miniorities are perceived as \"vulnerable\" and there is this idea of treating people with respect no matter their cultural background, skin color, language etc.\n\nMost white countries are diverse and have a lot of non-white citizens and migrants who yet to obtain their documents. In contrast, non-white countries are less immigrant-friendly and hence the society generally is not very aware of the aforementioned ideology/concept related to diversity, inclusion, racism etc.\n\nIn Japan for example, there are restaurants can out right say no to people who look foreign(especially those with darker skintones) to them and use the \"no foreigner\" excuse to deny non-Japanese customers in the disguise of xenophobia. Such excuse would not be acceptable in western society. If a restaurant owner from UK, France, U.S, Canada denies someone who is foreign from entering their restaurant just because they are a foreigner or in the worst case that they believe they look foreign by their ethnicity, they will get sued and exposed on social media, and by laws and societal standards they will lose their license to operate.\n\nA Taiwanese friend of mine also told me that he has experienced way more casual/systematic racism in Congo than in other european countries he has lived in(he travels around because he works as an intepreter for a logistic company). From being stopped by police and asked to pay dirty money since he looks asian, to being denied rental housing even though his paperwork was perfect to Congolese casually pulling their eyes and mimick chinese person speaking, the incident amount is absurd as opposed to what he experienced in Canada, U.S and New Zealand. Such contrast of racist incidents are also reported a lot by my other friends who are from different ethnicities and a particular Pakistani friend who has very dark skin of mine said he was denied multiple jobs when he was working in UAE because his employers outright prefer to hire white caucasian, arab or even east asian workers because \"it makes the company looks more professional\". There are no specific laws that will define prejudice/racism in many context in these countries and even if they are, many can get away with it and the society as whole does not put enough emphasis to fight agianst racial/ethnic discirmination like what the western society does.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe non-white countries are a lot more racist than white countries, and its not just limited to casual, day to day personal racism but also systematic racism, whether it stems from ignorance, historical/cultural context, colorism, pure hatred or a combination of the aforementioned. (See how China can outright limits the freedom of any ethnic minorities or lock away foreigners as the authority deems so, or that African countries can infringe the rights of white/non-black citizens or that the fact non-white countries do not have enough immigrant politicians in the government because people do not vote for them and they gain no power and favorism even in elections etc).", "authorship": "human"}

The partisan’s stance is unwavering; there is a right and a wrong, often framed in moral terms. And this denial of fallibility isn’t necessarily obnoxious or even conscious. Often, we don’t realize we’re thinking like a partisan.\n\nTake Sarah, who believes abortion is murder. Her political tribe is militantly committed to this view, and she’s unlikely to reconsider, no matter new evidence. Or Bob, who supports DEI initiatives, believing rolling them back would be societal regression. Both hold moral framings that leave little room for doubt.\n\nAnd the more polarized the issue, the more partisan someone likely is. In this way, partisanship is less of a status and more of a trait; we may be more partisan on some issues than others. \n\n# So what? What do you propose?\n\nPartisanship, rooted in cognitive biases, is human nature. But with rising polarization, it’s clearly destabilizing societies. Political discourse today is rife with [animosity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8Dho35c0Vs) and intolerance; folks across the spectrum recognize something needs to change.\n\nEvery year or so we see a new elite consensus on the path forward. [Fact-checking](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10584609.2019.1668894?journalCode=upcp20), [new systems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/30/elon-musk-x-fact-check-community-notes-misinformation/) of [content moderation](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2210666120), “[pre-bunking](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/global-vaccination-badnews/)”, [tackling](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/01/15/far-right-extremism-global-problem-worldwide-solutions/) [the](https://www.vox.com/politics/361136/far-right-authoritarianism-germany-reactionary-spirit) [far-right](https://jacobin.com/2022/09/trump-maga-far-right-liberals-polarization), a focus on “[information integrity](https://www.un.org/en/information-integrity)”. In time there comes recognition that many of these efforts fell short, or worse, actually [can polarize people more](https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2024/09/fact-check-polarization-opinion-politics/679898/). Eventually when the hype dies down, there’s usually an acceptance that these solutions are not the [panaceas](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pra2.634) initially proclaimed. \n\nContrary to what it seems, however, hope is not lost. There is remarkable space to respond to partisanship and polarization on an individual level when we get outside threatening or tribal environments. \n\nThe first step is just to take a step back. To take a breath. Heated political debate and moral grandstanding easily distract us from calm and collected reflection. \n\nIn a calm state, it’s not hard for most of us to acknowledge that the vast majority of our so-called opponents want good too. The other side is not evil, nor uniquely stupid or naive (insert other partisan insults here). \n\nAnd we need way more intellectual humility. That means what it sounds like: an acceptance that you could be wrong, and that your understanding is limited. \n\nThat includes increased awareness of human fallibility and biases. It also includes recognition that *human* biases apply to *all* of us, the political left and right. To be sure, cognitive biases can manifest differently across political groups. But it is a grave mistake to only catch the cognitive biases in action of one political side, as [some](https://www.psypost.org/conservatives-propensity-toward-conspiracy-thinking-can-be-explained-by-a-distrust-in-officials-and-paranoid-thinking/) [academic work](https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/liberals-conservatives-and-intolerance/) [has](https://reason.com/volokh/2023/11/02/are-right-wingers-more-prone-to-believe-conspiracy-theories-than-left-wingers/). Nonetheless, there is growing recognition of intellectual humility’s potential in [scholarly work](https://advances.in/psychology/10.56296/aip00025/) as well.\n\n# Supplementary Solutions\n\nAlthough intellectual humility seems to be the most promising and comprehensive, there are other supplementary solutions, stemming from an emphasis on empathy, and a byproduct of that, tolerance. \n\nIt would take careful deliberation, but we probably should limit and disincentivize political or otherwise polarizing discourse online. Political discussion should be brought offline. Otherwise we need to humanize our online forums much more. Relatedly, we already see [some platforms](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/26/1240737627/meta-limit-political-content-instagram-facebook-opt-out) moving away from hosting political content. \n\nLikewise, concepts such as ‘Middle Ground’ by the popular YouTube Channel [Jubilee](https://www.jubileemedia.com/) (but definitely not the [‘Surrounded’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH0M83drPAw) series), have the potential to humanize political opponents by providing a platform for calm exposition of the reasons behind our opinions. \n\nHowever, as with most online debates, these videos could do with a lot more nuance. One idea is to have capable persons on each political ‘side’ explain their stances on a scale from simple to complex, drawing from the media outlet  [WIRED’s ‘5 levels’ YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLibNZv5Zd0dyCoQ6f4pdXUFnpAIlKgm3N), where professors explain a concept like gravity to a kindergartner up through to a fellow expert. The idea here is not only exposure to different perspectives, but deeper explanations of why people believe what they believe, without opportunities for ‘gotcha’ retorts or debating. \n\n# The Hard Part \n\nOn an individual level, these solutions are highly effective. But America makes up nearly 350 million individuals. Change across society will be slow. It will also be hard.\n\nIt’s hard because as the majority among us, the partisan’s favoured mode of conversing, debating, is the default as well. Yet, forums that incentivize triumph instead of a greater common understanding, only polarize us more. \n\nLikewise, it’s hard, as most media, political movements and figures benefit from polarization. And that is a problem unto itself.\n\nAnd it’s hard because it’s not our human nature; partisanship is sort of in our DNA.\n\nBe that as it may, intellectual humility might just be the gene mutation we need.

And, before yall say I’m not being specific enough, let me clarify which exact choices I’m talking about.\n\nI’m talking about the following choices:\n- 2D graphics \n- pixel art graphics\n- real time with pause combat\n- turn based combat\n- top down perspective\n- isometric perspective\n- dice roll combat and resolution mechanics\n- side scroller perspective\n- point and click interfaces/mechanics\n\nPeople who act like these unconventional choices are objectively bad are themselves bad for gaming, at least the serious gamers are. I can’t blame someone for not being fond of these choices, nor can I blame someone for seeing any or all of them as dealbreakers for games they want to play. I’m more specifically talking about people who discuss these choices as objectively terrible, poorly thought out, or lazy.\n\nFirst off, I want to say that I used to be one of these people. I used to hate pretty much every single game design choice on that list with a few exceptions. But honestly, I’m starting to prefer games that have some of those choices now that I’ve expanded my horizons, played more indie games, and played more old games. They often have a lot to bring to the table that many 3D action based AAA games do not. Of course, there are a lot of examples where those choices were faulty or became outdated. However, that doesn’t mean they don’t have a place anymore. Game designers and developers have innovated on those choices and found places where they fit better than a lot of more conventional alternatives.\n\nI think the major elephant in the room is Baldur’s Gate 3. It’s a turn based rpg with dice roll combat and many dice roll resolution mechanics as well as an isometric-ish perspective. BG 3 won game of the year and got countless people who had never played video games into gaming. Furthermore, it’s impossible to argue that BG 3 is lazily made or really outdated at all. It uses one of the latest iterations of dungeons and dragons, and is probably the most expansive rpg to ever be made with its sheer amount of possible ways the game can go and the amount of secrets hidden away in every corner. It utilizes the DnD 5e ruleset so well and fixes a lot of the problems it has. And, it’s also extremely polished in a way that most AAA games aren’t. And, it’s super high budget. I know a lot of people were mad about it winning GOTY in 2023, but most of the complaints I heard about it were from people who very obviously didn’t play the game due to many of them calling it a sex game or a glorified dating sim. Neither of those arguments resemble BG 3 really at all to like anyone who’s played it.\n\nFurthermore, many of these design choices suit the games they’re playing far better than the alternatives these people want a lot of the time. Can you imagine how annoying Baldur’s gate 3 would be if it wasn’t point and click at all? Or if it was a full action combat game? Yeah I’m aware BG 3 has controller support and changes some things around to make it not point and click on consoles but combat is still point and click, and it’s far easier to play it point and click. Think too about how much people hate final fantasy going action combat. Or how much dragon age suffered with action combat all the way up till veilguard (which sounds like it’s bad in literally every other aspect). And the truth is, even if you could say these design choices shouldn’t be made anyway and that games should be designed around other ones, you’re just flat out wrong because lots of people enjoy these choices and the games that come out of them, including myself. Not everything needs to be COD or Skyrim.\n\n\nAnd you know what? The dragon age series suffered majorly by trying to switch to more action oriented mechanics because EA thought they’d be more profitable. This obsession with making all games action oriented, 3D, etc is causing a lot of series to get butchered for fans who actually like them in order to draw in a “modern audience”. And, BG 3 attracted modern audiences. So the sentiment is just plain wrong. It’s ruining a lot of otherwise good series.\n\nThe truth is, most tried and true design choices aren’t inherently bad. Most of them have their place and that includes the ones that are used often. If BG 3 can utilize almost every one of these hated design choices well and be loved by modern audiences, they’re not outdated or bad. Different choices work for different games.\n\nEdit: I wanna add that my main point is that a lot of games (such as dragon age) have majorly altered themselves to attract the illustrious modern audience and that this is ruining a lot of series and causing the original creatives to leave ", "authorship": "human"}

However, I argue that the extended family model offers several advantages that lead to greater financial and social stability that would be typically unavailable in other models \n\n1. Support for the young: Extended families offer much broader support for children it allows mothers to continue working with other family members able to take care of the child, instead of having to leave work or take on multiple jobs. My own mother before she met my father was a single mother and she had to quit schooling to take care of her child, the only thing she needed was support and extra hands, this model aids in situations with an absent father, where instead of only the mother taking care of the children it would rather be 10 or more. An extended family model would alleviate the financial and time strain on child rearing which would allow couples to have more children which may also solve the issue of declining birth rates in western society. \n\n2. Money pooling and financial safety net: In an extended family model workers in the family would pool their resources and allow the workers of the family to work normal jobs yet have a wealthy income to benefit the whole family. Shared living arrangements and financial support all the workers of the family can help alleviate the burdens of housing, childcare, healthcare and education costs. The ability to share these responsibilities gives families more flexibility in dealing with economic challenges.\n\n3. Cultural Preservation and Identity: Extended families help preserve and pass down cultural practices and family traditions. I come from a Portuguese immigrant background, yet I have no connection to it that I wish I had, In immigrant communities, the extended family acts as a cultural anchor, helping to maintain language, traditions, and identity.\n\n4. Socialization and Personal Development; Children in extended families are exposed to a variety of personalities and situations, which helps develop strong social and emotional skills. They also benefit from a wider range of role models, from older siblings to grandparents,, aunts and uncles who can offer more guidance. \n\n5. Elder Care: An extended family supports intergenerational caregiving. Older relatives, such as grandparents benefit from the help of younger family members.  This system helps prevent elder isolation and ensures that aging relatives receive care and attention. This also benefits the government as they would not longer need to offer social security to the elderly as the younger generation would be able to take care of the older generation. \n\nChange my view.", "authorship": "human"}

That might not necessarily mean maximizing the number of humans, but rather the total footprint of our particular tree of life.\n\nThere is a more scientific view that space exploration should leave what it finds undisturbed, only studying in a sterile environment. This is our current mode of exploration, and I'm not saying we should change this tomorrow. However if the solar system is explored and found sterile, in that case we should attempt to spread life wherever we can within it.\n\nThere is also the more anthropic philosophy which argues we should maximize the amount of humans, which I think is somewhat flawed goal in the extremely long term. We're probably not going to stay as what you could strictly call a single species, and we're probably going to get quite good at modifying nature around us, so I think it makes more sense to look at the whole tree of life over our particular species, and just enjoy that we get to go along for the ride.\n\nWe are a part of a particular tree of life. On a more Machiavellian level, I think this goal makes sense if we want to \"win\" in competition with other trees of life. Until proven otherwise, I think we should assume that life is extremely rare and/or we are extremely early. That means that there are maybe couple other sources of biological life beginning a phase of expansion in our galaxy, similar to ours.

{"Article Number": 180, "title": "CMV: Making a woman the main character of the Star Wars sequels was a mistake.", "article": "Many fans of Star Wars have criticized the sequel trilogy for a variety of reasons, many of which I think are valid. One common criticism centers on Rey, with many labeling her a “Mary Sue” or a poorly written character. While I’m not here to debate that point, I will say that I believe Daisy Ridley did a commendable job with the material she was given. Similarly, I’m not arguing that Rey’s gender is what ruined the series. However, I do think that making the protagonist a woman was a misstep for the franchise.\n\nAt its core, Star Wars has traditionally been a boys’ fantasy. Many fans first encountered the series as kids, imagining themselves as the hero—whether it was Luke Skywalker or Anakin. The majority of the Star Wars fanbase is male, and while there are certainly girls who love the series (and that’s great!), the franchise has always been particularly appealing to boys who see themselves in the characters.\n\nThis is where Rey, as the main protagonist, creates a disconnect. Some boys may struggle to see themselves in her character and, as a result, feel less drawn to the story. Speaking from personal experience, when I played as a kid, I never wanted to pretend to be a female character. To be clear, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with boys pretending to be girls, but for many young boys, it simply doesn’t resonate as strongly.\n\nThis isn’t to say that “boys’ stories” can’t feature strong female leads. Some of my favorite stories do—The Terminator, for example, is one of my favorite movies, and Sarah Connor is an incredible character. I also really enjoyed The Hunger Games, which leans more toward a female audience but is still an excellent story. Moreover, Star Wars itself has had memorable and beloved female characters, like Leia and Ahsoka, who add depth and richness to the universe. However, those characters weren’t the primary focus of the narrative, allowing boys to still see themselves as the central hero.\n\nUltimately, I don’t believe that making Rey the protagonist ruined the sequels or made them inherently bad. But I do think it lessened the connection for some of the franchise’s core audience—young boys—who may not have been able to fully immerse themselves in the story in the same way. While Star Wars should absolutely appeal to all genders, there’s something to be said for maintaining the type of hero that resonates most with the audience that has traditionally been its foundation.\n\nEdit post: shoutout to Baminer.

FEC", "article": "This is one of the most hated Supreme Court decisions but it seems so obviously correct to me so I am posting here. \n\nFirst, some things that *Citizens United* did NOT change to hopefully avoid some unproductive comments. It did not change the rules on direct donations to political candidates. Corporations and unions still cannot do that and the limits for individuals are the same. It did not establish the concept of corporations being people. This goes back at least to 1886 in *Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co.*\n\nBefore *Citizens United,* corporations and unions were restricted from spending on political ads before an election. The plaintiff, a nonprofit, was blocked by the FEC from distributing a movie it had made that was critical of Hillary Clinton just because there was an election going on. This to me is an obvious infringement on free speech. The government should not censor political speech and I feel that most Americans agree on that, so why do they hate a ruling that ended this censorship? Here are two quips I hear from people criticizing *Citizens United*:\n\n* \"Corporations aren't people\"\nHow are corporations not groups of people who have come together for a common goal? The only thing making them different from unions and nonprofits is that their goal is to make money, but why should this be a reason that they lose their constitutional rights? It seems absurd to suggest that if you are trying to make money, you longer have rights. What *is* a corporation if it's not a group of people?\n\n* \"Money isn't speech\"\nAgain, corporations are still banned from making direct donations. They are no longer banned from making ads aka \"independent expenditures.\" Of course these things cost money but if that was a reason they don't count as free speech, then the government could censor all kinds of speech that cost money. \n\nIn my view, corporations (and unions and nonprofits) are groups of people, who have a constitutional right to free speech. *Citizens United* ended the government's infringement on their rights. To change my view you would have to convince me that something in this paragraph is incorrect. I don't care about the effect it may have had on elections because I don't think that is a valid reason to restrict constitutional rights.\n\nCMV.", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 183, "title": "cmv: buying house on a mortgage can be a WORSE financial decision than renting.", "article": "So many people buy a house on a mortgage. In many countries, home ownership is seen as some sort of rite of passagement in adult life (UK I am looking at you as particularly bad culprit).  It's also widely believed it's a much better financial decision than paying rent for the rest of your life. Below is why I believe such opinions are flawed, and why I believe renting can be better financially, if the renter passively invests their money in the stock market. This is about FINANCES only, so I will not address other arguments for and against home ownership (e.g. being able to make changes to the house, more freedom with renting etc).\n\n* initial down payment / deposit for a home is usually huge. Usually 10-20% of the value of the home, can be less or more depending on region/country. The average person spends years saving up for the down payment , when they could have invested that money elsewhere in that time and grown it more.\n* E.g. let's say from 2015, I save for 10 years for a down payment, and that I had saved that money in a cash savings account as the safest place to store it (this is where I guess most people keep their down payment budget). By 2025, I have $150,000. If I had invested that money in a stock index fund like the S&amp;P 500 over 2015-2025 instead, assuming historic average stock market returns of 10%, my money wouldn't be $150,000 in 2025, it would be worth $260,000 instead. By holding all that money in cash in 2015-2025 so I could pay for a down payment on a house, I am missing out on gains of $110,000 over those 10 years.\n* *\"but after I pay off my mortgage, I have nothing more to pay, whilst renters have to pay rent for the rest of their lives\"* \\- no doubt this is a key attraction for many house buyers. but going back to my example above, from 2025 if I chose to keep investing the $260,000 over the next few decades into the stock market, it's very possible I can grow the money so much that I end up with **more money** ***after rental payments*** vs having a house with the mortgage paid off. Remember, with the stock market option I had a head start on investing, I started investing in 2015 (due to not having to save my money in cash for a down payment) and then I'm on $260,000 in 2025, at the point which the house buyer pays $150,000 to start investing in their house. the more you have at the beginning to invest, over time, due to the effects of [compounding](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp), the more your money will grow. Of course, actual results depends on the performance of the stock market vs the housing market in your area, but general average historical performance suggests a similar rate of return of around 10% a year for both properties and the stock market. And assuming similar rate of returns, it makes sense that you end up with more money if you started investing 10 years earlier, and historical compounding (money growing exponentially the more time you invest for) should more than negate for the fact many renters pay more in rent than home owners pay in their mortgage payments + maintenance.\n* This I believe is the biggest single advantage of investing in stocks and renting, vs buying a house on a mortgage. **More TIME**. Passively investing in the stock market does not take much time at all after the initial learning curve. I check my stock accounts once a month when I get paid, and put spare money into it then. Takes me about 15 minutes a month or 3 hours a year. Owning a home typically requires much more time than 3 hours a year on maintenance, and requires a lot of your time when buying and selling your home. Time is a commodity too, something homeowners typically do not acknowledge - with all the extra time I have by NOT buying, maintaining or selling a home, I can use that extra time to invest my own skillset, eg getting professional qualifications to pursue more lucrative career paths or side hustles, increasing my earnings which then I can use to grow my money even more. When you consider time as a commodity, there is only one winner - passively investing in the stock market whilst renting.\n* Liquidity - investing in a home isn't liquid, it is not easy or quick to take out the assets on a home to invest elsewhere or use for whatever else you may need. Outside of private pensions, investing in the stock market is liquid and offers flexibility - you can take out some of your money whenever you need. This flexibility can be beneficial financially, if you for example take out some of your money in the stock market and invest it successfully elsewhere.\n\nIndividual circumstances vary and the housing market varies a lot regionally too. And nobody knows how the housing market and stock markets will perform over the next few decades. However, I don't buy this belief held by many homeowners or aspiring homeowners that renting is 'throwing your money out the window'. I believe renting can be a better financial decision for many people vs buying a house on a mortgage. Change my mind.", "authorship": "human"}

Global Cooperation is Unlikely. While many developed nations are working to reduce emissions, the largest emitters, like China, India, and Russia, are continuing to grow their industrial sectors and increase emissions. Even if we drastically cut emissions, these countries will still continue to pump pollutants into the atmosphere, rendering our efforts pointless. The disparity in global emissions growth means that any local reductions will be undermined by global emissions increases.\n\n\n2. In an increasingly unstable world, economic growth and national security should take precedence over climate regulations. The potential for conflict and economic instability, especially with the rise of nations like China, is a much more immediate threat than the long-term risks of climate change. Economic collapse, trade wars, and military conflict are closer to home, and regulating emissions could hurt our own industries and competitiveness at a time when we need to focus on strengthening our economy.\n\n\n3. Innovation and Adaptation Over Prevention: Instead of focusing on emission cuts that may not even make a significant difference, we should focus on innovations and technologies that can help us adapt to climate change. Human innovation has always been a driving force in overcoming challenges. If the climate is inevitably changing, it makes more sense to focus on adapting to those changes rather than trying to reverse them, which seems nearly impossible given global trends.\n\n\n4. Nuclear Energy is the Answer. We need to focus on practical, scalable energy solutions like nuclear power. It's the only reliable energy source that can replace fossil fuels without emitting CO2. While fusion may be the future, nuclear power can be expanded today. Solar and hydro are great options too, but wind energy, with its negative impact on landscapes and wildlife, shouldn't be prioritized.\n\n\n\nIn short, I think emissions regulations are futile in the grand scheme of things and only serve to hinder economic progress without yielding meaningful global impact.

Black Americans earn 76 cents for each dollar earned by a white American, and Latinos earn 73 cents for each dollar earned by a white American. And a lot of people use this kind of data to claim that this somehow shows that women and ethnic minorities like African-Americans or Latinos are severely and systematically discriminated against in the workplace.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that sexism and racism don't exist and aren't a problem anymore. But I just want to make the argument that taking those \"pay gap\" figures as proof for widespread sexism and racism in the workplace is rather disingenuous. Because all that those figures show is that there is an earning gap really, but the figures in no way prove that sexism or racism are the reason for that earning gap.\n\nNow, for example women, on average, work significantly fewer years than men and take significantly more time off work than the average man. Women are also more likely to work part-time and, on average, work fewer hours per day. And they're more likely to pursue low paying careers like for example childcare work or retail jobs, and less likely to pursue high paying professions like surgeons or engineers.\n\nNow could it be that sexism may be partially to blame as to why women pursue lower-paing careers and are still much more likely then men to take time off work to look after children? Maybe, sure. But it's hard to say to what extent. There are probably also millions of women who genuinely prefer being a stay-at-home mum or who really may not be interested in pursuing a high-paying but at the same time extremely stressful career that requires crazy hours.

Racism surely exists, but the racial pay gap does not prove that certain ethnic minorities are heavily discriminated against. There are various complex factors. Like for example Latino immigrants are often from lower class economic backgrounds, and are often quite poor even by the standards of their country of origin when they first arrive in the US. And so of course poverty can be a massive handicap, but it would simply be wrong to put the blame for lower earnings of some ethnic minorities on racism in the workplace.\n\nAnd so the men vs. women pay gap and racial pay gap in the US does not prove that there is widespread sexism or racism in the workplace.

A recent article in The New York Times I read recently said fascism is more of an aesthetic and I agree.\n\nIn the past few months I've been reading a few books on the history of Nazi Germany and also learning more about Italy under Mussolini and wartime Japan. What I mean by the fact that fascism is impossible to define is that unlike communism it doesn't seem to offer anything distinct. Hitler was an ultranationalist who believed in the supremacy of a designated race (the Aryans in his case) and believes in the exclusion of certain undesirable groups. But is this not just white supremacist ultranationalist far-right ideology? What makes fascism functionally different from leaders and thinkers before Mussolini and Hitler, like France's Charles Maurras? Germany committed a genocide in Namibia against the Herero and Nama before fascism was even a work in the dictionary. In the biography Hitler: Downfall (1939-1945) Volker Ullrich talks about how many of the core elements of Nazism were inherited from the era of Wilhelm II and Imperial Germany, such as the idea of living space stemming from the vast empire Germany carved out in the Treaty of Brest Litovsk after Tsarist Russia collapsed. This is why I think fascism is more of an aesthetic, the only thing that distinguished Nazi Germany and Mussolini was the insignia, the fasces to which Mussolini drew the name, the swastika, the logos, et al.\n\nAnother reason I believe fascism is inherently just about aesthetics rather than having defined contours in terms of thought that distinguish itself is the fact that wartime Japan is not commonly labelled as fascist despite being just as fervently ultranationalist and using the same notion of the master race.\n\nIn essence I believe fascism is an ideological empty vessel that contains the insiginia for which the regimes of Hitler and Mussolini are known while the actual ideological undergirding is in the tragically long running tradition of European white supremacy, anti semitism, ultranationalism and genocide.\n\nIn conclusion, I just think that instead of trying the stymie the ascendancy of problematic politicians by labelling them as fascist we should call them white supremacists or ultranationalists or whatever more meaningful label actually applies.\n\nSorry if this is very meandering, but if anyone wants clarity please tell me.", "authorship": "human"}

That would be like making school shootings or obesity the hallmark of American identity or cherrypicking some one off incident from Alabama to assert that Americans love their cousins a bit too much. One could justify their disdain for any group with facts and figures but what we have been seeing is entirely meaningless punching down on Indians and absolutely no consequences to it. And this is not even a problem just seen from the MAGA right, as in the recent elections a lot of voters of Indian origin actually shifter right on account of not wanting to take paternalistic moral talking-down on some sociopolitical issues from the American left, especially with regards to identity politics as we do not fit their model of oppressed immigrants that needs a white liberal savior either, so even they have to put us in the oppressor group.\n\nI would be willing to change my position if someone could show me that there is a considerable pushback towards this racism the way we pushback on racism towards black folks or any other identity group.

While happiness, joy, and optimism make life enjoyable, they don’t push people to achieve greatness(To each his own). Negative emotions such as anger, fear, stress, and even spite are far more effective at driving action and results.\n\nNegative emotions have always had a survival advantage. Fear kept our ancestors alive by pushing them to avoid danger or act quickly when facing a threat. Anger gave them the energy and focus to fight or assert dominance. These emotions are hardwired into our brains for action, they force us to do something. Spite, often dismissed as petty, is an underrated motivator. The desire to prove others wrong or succeed out of sheer defiance can push people to surpass their own limits. The idea that positive emotions are the key to success is largely a myth perpetuated by self-help books and motivational speakers. While positivity feels good and can help build long-term resilience, it doesn’t create the same sense of urgency or action as negative emotions. Sure, being positive might make you likable, but it doesn’t necessarily make you effective.\n\nOf course, relying too much on negative emotions has its risks. Chronic stress, unchecked anger, or excessive spite can lead to burnout, damaged relationships, and even self-destruction. However, even with these downsides, negative emotions remain objectively better at driving people to act.\n\nI often get lost on one point and usually fail to get across what I had in mind(bear with me), what I'm saying is that most of us are in lower points in our lives than the ones that we want/envision, and when it comes to pushing ourselves, I believe that the emotions that I spoke of proved to bear more results throughout history than the counterpart did, I'm not saying positive emotions have no use, but they have their time, and I believe the time for those emotions is when you reach a certain goal or achieve some form of stability.\n\nI wrote this post to convey that unlike what most people say about negative emotions, they have their use and they reach higher goalposts than the positive ones so we shouldn't dismiss them and try our best to exploit them.", "authorship": "human"}
{"Article Number": 199, "title": "CMV:  Not All Jobs Should Pay a Living Wage", "article": "Change My View: \n\nI don't begrudge people making a living wage, but I feel that some jobs are 'starter' jobs. IMO most customer facing retail jobs such as fast food servers and grocery stockers are jobs for people still in high school, or just out of high school. Jobs for teenagers where you are learning the ropes of working.\n\nI've done these jobs, and understand that they can be very hard work, but they don't usually take a ton of skill, experience or education. And (in theory) if you get good at these jobs, and gain experience in them, you move up to better paying jobs that require more experience, like assistant manager, manager, etc.\n\nYears ago I owned a small, independent retail store, and I watched minimum wage go from $6-$14. I wanted to be a good boss, so I started out paying over minimum wage by around a buck. I also made sure there were drinks and snacks for the staff to have (for free). I also didn't mind if, when the store was slow and tasks were finished, if the staff wanted to sit down and study for finals or do a crossword or whatever. (not at all trying to make out like I was some hero here or anything. Just wanted a chill, happy working environment for myself and everyone else.)\n\nThen minimum wage went up. And up. And up.\n\nI didn't have to fire anyone due to wages, but I def held off on hiring when we did have people leave. By the end, I had about half the staff that I did at the beginning.\n\n$1/ hour is $2080 per year in wages, assuming a 40 hour work week. Add to that what employers have to pay CPP $124, vacation pay $83.20and employer EI contributions of 47.46., so $1 raise in minimum wage means the employer pays out $2334.66 per year per person making that extra $1. (I'm in Canada. These numbers may have changed a bit from when I was doing this 10+ years ago.)\n\nIf you have multiple employees, that is a big leap in cost. And as a retailer, you can't just up your prices to adjust. Little stores still have to stay competitive with the Walmarts, pay rent, heat, electric, buy stock, insurance, taxes, etc etc.\n\nMost of our employees were teenagers or early twenties. Some were really great employees, and some ... were not. Not fireable offences, but some employees needed to be watched more carefully so they wouldn't be lazy/make mistakes. I would have much rather paid the better people better, and the less good people less, but at the end, I couldn't afford to start people above min wage and everyone made the same, even though there was often a clear difference in skill and work ethic.\n\nTLDR: Less skilled jobs should not be 'forever' jobs. Just starter ones.\n\nBTW: I am ALL for having caps on what CEOs make. No one should be a Billionaire and no one should make 1000x what their lowest paid employee makes.", "authorship": "human"}

That AS is not legal for any person who is incarcerated, out on bond, or has warrants.\n\nEdit: \n\n2. No payments involved: exclusively BETWEEN the assisting and the assisted. The person who is directly performing the AS and the person who is receiving the AS.\nWhen you involve money into the agreement that is essentially taking the life of another, you have to consider who this legality will be accessible to.\nThe CDC reports \"An estimated 2.2 million adults who were living in poverty (i.e., family income of less than\n100% of the federal poverty threshold) reported having suicidal thoughts in the past year; this number accounts for 6.6% of the adult population living in poverty.\" Many people also reported creating a plan of how they would carry out this process. Logically, these statistics are only based upon what has been reported but so many individuals experience the dilemma of suicide and are not represented in that statistic. So, would you expect these people to pay? People who cannot afford to put food on the table? In economics, we are also taught that those of high-income are just as susceptible to suicidal idealization if not higher than those of lower income. So how much would someone have to make to be required to pay for these services? You can argue that you should make anyone pay, however it would become another case of scraping any little bit of money from poor people who simply cannot afford it and do not have it. So if they cannot afford it, do we deny them the choice of living? Do we just say, you cannot pay up so you must continue to suffer?\n\n4. The incarcerated, out on bond, or those with warrants:\n\nIf the incarcerated were allowed AS, that opens the door for murderers, rapists, predators, terrorists and many twisted people to take the \"easy way out\" instead of serving time for their crimes. AS in this case would be a favor for these individuals and the victims of these individuals would not receive the justice they deserve.\nQuite frankly, I have no opposition to the death penalty for those serving life sentences if they have served a large amount of time already. But you either have to exclude everyone or include everyone in the jail system. Should we offer AS to child-rapists or murderers serving a life-sentence but not those who have to serve 15+ year sentences for drug possessions? If the prisons allowed for some individuals but not others to have the option of AS, you will absolutely have inmates who will kill each other at an even higher rate than they do now.", "authorship": "human"}

Despite veering away from this concept in recent years it was the foundation of our prison system since colonial times when William Penn passed the great law of 1682 establishing the first criminal code in the colonies separate from the British.

There are certain styles of parenting that absolutely should be condemned, whether it is neglectful parenting where the kids basically have to raise themselves, or extremely strict parenting where the kid lives in constant fear of punishment, or the whole “kid’s first bully” type thing. These are both examples of child abuse.\n\nWith that being said, I don’t think it is right to shame parents for parenting their children in a way that you wouldn’t parent your own child. I personally don’t have any children, but I can see how hard a parent’s job can be. It’s exhausting, and the majority of parents are doing what they believe is best for their children.\n\nRecently I have come across some gentle parenting influencers. I don’t really pay attention to them but they pop up on my feed once in awhile…\n\n*sighs* opens the comments\n\nThey are all negative. Whether it is talking about how soft kids are today, whether it is talking about how their kids would win in a fight, or sometimes even saying something that is grossly homophobic. Of course, these are Instagram comments which are known to be the breeding grounds of rage bait, but that made me think: Why do people shame parents for parenting choices?\n\nOf course, there are times where there is genuine concern for the child. There are parents that are abusing their children out there, but most of the time, they are shaming parents out of contempt. They shame other parents to have a feeling of moral superiority.\n\nHere are some reasons why parent shaming (with the information given) is a bad thing:\n\n- **Parenting is Hard:** Ultimately, parents are working their asses off to raise their children in the way they deem is best. When they get shamed for doing that, it is extremely hurtful to the parents.\n\n- **Parents make mistakes:** Every parent makes mistakes, good parents learn from them. I am very happy with the way my parents raised me, but they made mistakes. Due to external pressure, whether direct or indirect, they feel like everything gone wrong with my brother and I is their fault and they are bad parents because of it.\n\n- **There is more than one way to raise a child:** Look, we can sit here and talk about research for the best parenting styles, and while that information may be useful to draw from, every child is different and their parents know them best. My parents had to raise my brother and I in different ways due to our differing personalities, and ultimately parents just have to do what they think is right.\n\nI know this is long, but I hope I’m giving you guys a lot to work with.

Quite the contrary. \n\nIn recent years, PornHub has been outed as a huge driving force in human sex trafficking, and I myself have signed petitions for shutting it down since I found out. This fact was one of the reasons given for the ban, and I think that the message this sends could have positive ramifications in spite of any drawbacks this could cause. \n\nThe pro: This sends a message that sex trafficking has consequences, and there's a government in charge now that, if nothing else, is willing to do something about that. \n\nThe cons: I've heard a lot of people point out flaws in this decision, and I understand them.

But I'm making this now after reading a scary article from professor Noah Smith: [The Players on the Eve of Destruction](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-players-on-the-eve-of-destruction). In short, war is back, and of future wars, a Sino-American one is the granddaddy of them all. And here, contrary to most of Reddit or the West, I think China has the upper hand.\n\nBasically there are two reasons for this:\n\n\\- China has way more manufacturing capability than the US\n\n\\- China is way more united and will have higher morale than the US\n\n**The Arsenal of Autocracy**\n\nIn WWII, the Allies won because the United States was the Arsenal of Democracy. It had half the world's manufacturing capability at the time, and it supplied the Allies, especially the Soviets, with everything from ammo to jeeps to canned food. But now, to quote Noah Smith, [the Arsenal of Democracy is gone](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/people-are-realizing-that-the-arsenal). In is place is China, the world's factory and now the Arsenal of Autocracy. [It manufactures more than the next 9 countries combined](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/china-worlds-sole-manufacturing-superpower-line-sketch-rise), including 3 times the US.\n\nWe know China utterly dominates in civilian manufacturing and infrastructure (which is part of the reason [I made a previous CMV](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cv6in1/cmv_east_asian_countries_are_more_developed_than/)), but did you know that it extends to the military sector as well? China is rapidly expanding its military, from its navy to its missile and nuclear arsenals. It has a shipbuilding capacity 230 times that of the US, and completely dominates the global drone industry, which is critical to future wars like we've seen in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the US military, despite a bloated budget ([which might not be that much bigger than China's](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-09-13/china-spends-700-billion-on-its-military-approaching-us-900-billion)), is falling behind:  \n  \n\\- [Catch Up: China Is Getting New Weapons \\[5 to 6 Times\\] Faster Than the U.S.](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/catch-china-getting-new-weapons-faster-us-203462)  \n  \n\\- [The U.S. Navy is Falling Behind China, and The Pentagon Knows It](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-u-s-navy-is-falling-behind-china-and-the-pentagon-knows-it/)\n\n\\- [The U.S. Defense Industrial Base Is Not Prepared for a Possible Conflict with China](https://features.csis.org/preparing-the-US-industrial-base-to-deter-conflict-with-China/)\n\nSure, the US military is still technologically advanced, with its F-35s and aircraft carriers being marvels of engineering. But will quality matter against quantity? I fear that the US is now in the same position as Nazi Germany, which had all sorts of advanced weapons like the Tiger tank, but was outnumbered in terms of materiel versus the Allies. Will the US's tech superiority matter when China makes 10 J-20s for every F-35, or when hundreds of Dongfeng missiles whittle down America's aircraft carriers one by one?\n\n**Chinese Nationalists: the new Taliban**\n\nI think it's a given that China will be more united and willing to sacrifice compared to the US. Just look at how differently Chinese people responded to COVID-19 versus Americans. That was against a faceless virus; a war will push those differences to the extreme.  \n  \nThis will be especially apparent if the war is over Taiwan. Chinese people for decades have been taught that Taiwan is an inviolable part of China, only separated thanks to the evil West and its imperialist machinations. Now, in a war to get Taiwan back? [Lots of Chinese people will be more than willing to sign up for that](https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-nationalists-urge-war-to-reintegrate-taiwan-after-presidential-election/7444075.html), whether by literally going to the front lines or by making the necessary sacrifices at home. Which given my experience with Chinese nationalists both online and offline, that's 100% believable.\n\nMeanwhile most Americans are tired of playing world police (not to mention many Americans, on both the left and the right, outright hate their country). Imagine American soldiers being deployed far from home, for a cause most feel little connection to, against Chinese soldiers with morale levels of ISIS or the Taliban. Meanwhile back in America, protests over both the war and the ensuing economic collapse will bring the nation to its knees. It will be like Vietnam or Afghanistan all over again.\n\nIn fact, we're seeing something similar with Russia's war in Ukraine right now. Pundits have predicted that Russians will turn against the war any day now, but instead [Russians support Putin and his war more than ever](https://kyivindependent.com/poll-77-of-russians-support-war-in-ukraine/).

All while Western support for Ukraine is wavering more and more. [No wonder Russia is slowly but surely winning](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c39uhz/cmv_ukraine_has_lost_the_war_and_is_doomed_to/).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSo yeah, doubt the US has a real chance to actually win against China. Granted I think a Chinese victory will be a Pyrrhic one, after years of grinding out a war of attrition and sending men to the meat grinder. But it would be a victory nonetheless, one that cements China's rise as the leader of a new world order.", "authorship": "human"}

I felt way more comfortable/confident with them than I did with my classmates, which would never listen to me or take me seriously.\n\nAs I grew older, the age with which I felt confident around started diminishing, but eventually I had 3 or 4 close friends that were 3-6 years older than me. These friendships were incredibly important in my life. I had some really good people to look up to.\n\n\n\nMy grandma always tells me that teaching is the best way to learn. Nowhere is that more apparent than in spending time with younger people/kids. I get to be that boy they look up to, and I get to know myself better and be more comfortable with myself\n\nMy cousins are 14 and 11. They're the closest people to me after my immediate family. I know people will say \"WELL IT DOESN'T COUNT BECAUSE THEY'RE YOUR FAMILY. Ok, some of my friends from my immediate friend group are also 12/13, and I'm close with them. How is that weird?\n\nThe amount of assumptions and projections that arise from these kinds of stories are genuinely worrying. I'm not saying that the concept of maturity is relative, which is NOT, but that shouldn't dictate the stuff that you can/can't have in common as much as overall boundaries should, obviously set by both the younger and the older persons. They should also be taught more thoroughly by parents. Another example:\n\nIn a family camp I went to last year, I met a girl about 8 which started talking to me and stuff, and we kinda became \"friends\" for the remainder of the camp. What was I supposed to do, ignore her?\n\nJust be careful and you're good, for example, I refused to tickle her when she asked me, just because I didn't feel comfortable touching her, and it was not a good lesson for her. That's a boundary that a kid might not respect, but it's inalienable\n\nWhen they saw her with me, no one batted an eye. Hell, I was talking with her mother while holding her, and she even smiled.\n\nSo yeah, that should be the norm. Doesn't matter if they're older or younger, as long as it's a genuine connection without anything else, and you set proper boundaries, you're good to go.\n\nIf you don't see it like this, I'm genuinely curious as to why, so feel free to discuss\n\n:)", "authorship": "human"}

So for practical purposes we might say a \"superintelligent AI\" is simply an AI more powerful than all of humanity combined. \n\n\\- It also doesn't seem known to me that such whole brain emulation *won't* evolve into superintelligence. \n\n\\- I've heard it said that *any* AGI that's at least as good as a human in all domains of interest will radically exceed a human in some. It does seem likely that a whole brain emulation, will at least in some dimensions, radically exceed the abilities of a human, but only because they will be able to speed up the simulation. But it's not obvious to me that will help in lots of domains! Consider flirting: will one be *better at flirting* if one has 3 hours to think about one says before one says it? No! That's not how our brains evolved, that's not how they work. You'd forget what the other person said or not have it salient enough in mind. You'd \"lose your place\" emotionally. You could meet the love of your life and end up *bored*. Part of good flirting is getting in sync with someone, it's not benefited by extra thinking time, because fundamentally thats drawing you out of sync with the person you're trying to connect with. Mental arithmetic? Sure probably. (And, maybe we would somehow tack a calculator onto the simulation which the brain could call. That's fine. But in the absence of further argument that simulated brain is comparable in ability to a human with a calculator!)\n\n\\- It does not seem known inevitable to me that we will have AGI pre-whole brain emulation. \n\n\\- It does not seem known inevitable that that non-whole brain emulation AGI will become superintelligent. \n\n\\- It does not seem known inevitable that that non-whole brain emulation AGI won't become superintelligent. \n\n\\- It does not seem known inevitable that developments in AI will not lead to catastrophic harm. To clarify this: I *think* it's possible for a really well-designed hack to severly damage the internet, in a way that could prevent it existing in the form it does now for e.g. at least a few months. I'm not a cybersecurity expert, so maybe I'm wrong about that. Assuming it is possible, maybe by a team of programmers working for several years in secret on some zero-day/social engineering attack, it seems concievable to me that increasingly capable LLMs will eventually gain this ability too.

{"Article Number": 222, "title": "CMV: \"YYYY-MM-DD\" is a superior date format to \"DD-MM-YYYY\"", "article": "You may have seen [this meme](https://imgur.com/5dYgqoE.png) before, explaining why the \"DD-MM-YYYY\" date format (commonly used in Europe) is superior to the \"MM-DD-YYYY\" format (commonly used in the US).  However, I think that it misses the mark a lot, and both of those formats are inferior to one that puts the year first, then the month, then the date (e.g. \"2024-12-30\")\n\nI think this format is better than the other two for a few reasons:\n\n* It matches how people normally express numbers.  Typically we express numbers in a way that is [Big Endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness); we say the largest magnitude part of the number first, then descending down to the smallest part.  For example, if you want to write the number five million and one, you would write it as 5,000,001.  You start with the \"5\" (which has the biggest magnitude, since it counts millions) and end with the \"1\" (since it has the smallest magnitude and counts ones).  The DD-MM-YYYY date format flips this (kind of, see below) and starts with the smallest magnitude and goes to the largest.\n\n* When I said it flips it, that's only kind of true.  The numbers are still big-endian for each individual part of the date.  For example, writing the current year as \"2024\" is big-endian.  It starts with the 2 (which represents thousands of years, the largest magnitude piece of information), followed by the \"0\" for hundreds, the next \"2\" for tens, and then the \"4\" for ones.  It's big-endian, descending magnitude.  And the month and date parts are also big-endian.  So when you write with DD-MM-YYYY, you don't really end up with a big-endian or small-endian date format.  It's a small-endian collection of individual date parts which are themselves big-endian, resulting in a mixed-endian result where the magnitudes go up and down (much like the pyramid on the right side of the meme posted at the top).\n\n* If you add in time-of-day, it becomes even more clear that you're going up and down in terms of magnitude.  We write time of day in HH:MM:SS format.  As far as I know, there's no country where SS:MM:HH is preferred.  This is big-endian, starting with the largest magnitude and then moving down from there.  If you list the date in \"DD-MM-YYYY\" format, and include the time, then you're always going to have a format where it goes up and down.  Either \"HH:MM:SS DD-MM-YYYY\" or \"DD-MM-YY HH:MM:SS\"  Both of these are \"out of order pyramids\" in the illustration above.\n\n* \"YYYY-MM-DD\" also has the nice advantage in the fact that, if you sort filenames or other pieces of data in a simple alphanumeric way, then you are also putting them in chronological order.  The other two date formats don't have this.\n\nUltimately, the only advantage that I can think of that DD-MM-YYYY has over YYYY-MM-DD is \"but it's what some people are already used to, so why change?\", which is incidentally the exact same reason people choose MM-DD-YYYY over DD-MM-YYYY.   \n\nSo change my view.", "authorship": "human"}

I've had a mix of the Redneck influence, and the \"Fiscally Conservative\" white Collar New York style of competitiveness and machoism. I saw the divorces, the anger, the lack of emotion, morbid senses of humor, and all this humanity they may have buried deep down with vices that include unhealthy philosophies. The humanity is in most of the men in my life I'm thinking about, I've seen tears, and impotent expressions of showing care and connectedness... With the younger generation it forms itself differently.\n\nPersonally, I hate all of it, and think it is all bullshit. Even as a teen. Most criticism I got for that idea, was that the only reason I hate it is because I don't win as often or that I'm a loser. In some cases the F word was used a lot growing up by friends and the like.\n\nI always liked the smart ass reply The Dude gave in The Big Labowski too the rich Labowski pondering what it means to be a \"man\" - and The Dudes only reply after being asked? \"Yeah, sure, that or a pair of a testicles.\".\n\nAnyway, in short, being a \"man\" means telling a male to be sociopathic against their own truth of how human they are. A woman or a man can be useful and make hard decisions, but I believe being a \"man\"  and its principles encourages the problems which we see today - Even though, a lot of people are saying most men aren't \"man\" enough to solve the worlds problems today. It created this weird cycle of ultra cold hearted competitiveness, that even women are starting to pick up on (after so many years of being pigeon holed into being caring and loving by society) and acting on.\n\nEspecially today, like in dating, everything is a method and a manipulation now, there's no heart. Just cold calculated desires to get a person to be approved of or check off boxes. Everyone on some level is insecure as fuck. unless you're acting sociopathically and/or narcissistically. It's sad, it's really sad to me.\n\nI believe being masculine, is just another way of telling someone to lose heart, become goal oriented, and robotic. I'm being a bit dramatic I know there's a spectrum, but it does lean more towards this weird insecure ball of boring assholes and society at each others throats - Love, doesn't exist, everyone copies everyone else now, everything has a damn standard that no one can live up to in their own heads. It's not okay!\n\nBy American Standards Male Role Models Are All Mostly Sociopaths - And we are gaslit into thinking their thin veneer of purpose and principle and ego is something to relate too and is cool or human. That that, cold, stoic, harsh way of dealing with life is strong, and is \"our way of showing our love\" - It sounds abusive.\n\nWhere's the grace? To me, trying to be \"masculine\" is for a bunch of cowards who just want an excuse to manipulate, hurt, and create shortcuts to some form of what we call success.\n\nLike I said though, there is a spectrum to all of this, and I just think the pendulum is leaning way too far to the other side encouraging sociopathic, narcissistic, overly competitive, insecure - \"Winners\"\n\nI like strength in a person. Some people I look up to, fictional or real, are people like Picard, Freddie Mercury, Keanu Reeves (DON'T stop STOP IT STOP ROLLING YOUR EYES), Ripley, Bernie Sanders, Steve Wozniak, Alan Turing, Jean-Michel Basquiat etc. - That's just off the top of my head, but the common theme between them? They are unashamedly themselves, they know themselves, they were or are okay with their weaknesses and knowing them... Most of their stories have a common theme, they don't fight who they are or live up to standards... So, maybe, based on what I've seen in my life with all the anger and fighting and cold connections with men around me in my own life, is that maybe masculinity needs to be redefined (at least in America) and not just for males. Masculinity should be about having the strength to accept our weaknesses and being okay with not living up to a standard that only suits those with a personality disorder. No more of this overly competitive, shallow, heartless, self absorbed, way of life...\n\nOr maybe I'm just a dumb F##", "authorship": "human"}

But still hang on there to understand my point of view. \n\nOnline i always hear europeans dragging americans because of their racism. It's always this slight superior feeling that makes them claim oh well in europe we call mixed race people for what they are (untrue). At least in europe black people don't get killed (also untrue). Or in europe there's classism not racism, we discriminate based on nationality or financial situation (totally false).\n The only reason it seems like europe is more accepting versus pocs than USA is because of media. In Usa there's a much larger black community and they rightly so raise their voices everytime something bad happens (like the George Floyd case and the consequent BLM movement). Instead in europe black people are not that united, there's no community and so europeans can say and do whatever with less repercussions.\n\n As a mixed race woman who has suffered everyday of racism since i was born here in europe, it boils my blood everytime i hear europeans trying to pass themselves as this worderful open minded, progressive place. Yes, in Usa there's more violence against black people compared to europe, but Usa is just a much more violent place than Europe in general. \nBut when was the last time you've heard people going to a basketball game with racist signs, throwing bananas on the court and making monkey noises? Idk, i never did. In europe it happens constantly during football matches though. \nThese are rich successful athletes being mocked all the time and then europeans have the nerve to say online there's just classism here, huh? And in Usa i suspect it is much less likely for americans to just constantly stare black people on the street. Here in europe, especially in small cities you can't even walk on the street without people staring, pointing at you and approaching you to ask unsolicited ignorant questions. In america, black people are kinda accepted as americans. You don't hear americans say all the time that \"Beyonce should go back to her country\". In europe, black people are always othered. It doesn't matter if you were born here, if you speak the native language perfectly, if you're culturally european, if one of your parent is native to the place they just see colour. You're a perpetual foreigner and treated as such. Even if you just take a stroll in many european cities, you'll find countless of racist graffitis everywhere. Plus, like i've said before black people here don't have any support like in the USA. No club, no political party or whatsover.  We don't have any means to fight back and just have to stay silent or be accused of being too \"sensitive\" or to just \"go back to our countries\". \nSo whenever we try to complain, we are always dismissed. And it ain't easy. So living in europe as a black person or a poc in general is much worse than in the USA. \n\n\nEdit.: I'm getting a lot of messages about how Europe is not a country and i shouldn't talk like it is a monolith. But what these people fail to understand is that racism is widespread all across this continent. There are countries who are doing better than some other ones, yes, but at the end of the day we can fairly state that europeans do share common views and act pretty similarly when it comes to Pocs living in their countries. It would be hard to find an european country where a black or asian person would be seen as nothing else than a foreigner. And racism acts in football stadiums is a trend spread over several european countries. It happened in italy, spain, france, england, germany, serbia and so on. So why single out just one country, when almost the entire continent is at fault of doing more or less the same stuff? ", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 235, "title": "CMV: the Alladin remake is better than the original", "article": "Generally I like the original Disney cartoons more than their remakes, but Alladin is the exception. I loved the cartoon growing up as a child in the 90s and my son has recently been enjoying both versions. Let me break down why the new one is better in nearly every way:\n\nGenie wanting to be human adds a humbleness to his desire to be free. He doesn't care if he loses his power. He's tired of being in chains. I also like how he expected Aladdin to be a bad guy, which explains why he befriends Alladin when he realizes he's different.\n\nDalia doesn't even exist in the first one, but she's a fantastic addition, bringing humor and depth to the story. For instance, Alladin thinking Jasmine is a handmaiden while Jasmine later thanks he's a prince. It's an extra dynamic to their relationship. \n\nOn that note, the relationship of Aladdin and Jasmine has more buildup in the remake. He's sneaks into the castle, he stealthily returns her earring later which clues her to who he is. Even smaller details like the Rajah liking both Alladin and Prince Ali. They get more time.\n\nThen there's the dance scene from the remake which is a great addition. It's over the top and ridiculous, but really fun and charming to see Alladin being helped by the genie to woo the princess.\n\nThe sleight of hand of Aladdin is also a great touch, being used several times for important plot points, even with Abu stealing the lamp in the cave. It all makes sense.\n\nCarpet getting saved from being stuck under a rock is a nice detail for why he tags along instead of in the cartoon where he just followed them for no reason. I also don't like how in the original the carpet flies the Sultan around, but it doesn't raise any suspicion.\n\nThen there's Jafar. In the cartoon he is way too over the top an evil bad guy. That's not to say he's not clearly evil in the remake, but they develop his motives more than just stealing rubies and marrying the princess. He seeks power and the thought of being second best sickens and engages him. This makes the climax where Aladdin tricks him into becoming a genie come full circle, attacking his weak point.\n\nThen there's the music. The music is great in the first movie, no doubt. I think they did a great job recapturing the magic in One Jump Ahead and A Whole New World in the remake and they're on par with the original. Will Smith is a professional musician, though, and he outdoes Robin Williams in the Genie songs, Friend Like Me and Prince Ali. He just brings great style and energy to these songs which elevates them from the originals.\n\nLastly, the original feels dated and has a lot of cheese in it.\n\nAnyway, that's how I feel. If you want to CMV, convince me that there's significant aspects of the original that are better, parts in the original that were excluded for the worse, or parts of the remake that were added for the worse.", "authorship": "human"}
{"Article Number": 236, "title": "CMV: Historical Accuracy in Media Doesn’t Matter as Much as People Think", "article": "I don’t understand the common criticism that historical accuracy in media is paramount. Most period-piece games, movies, or shows use history as a backdrop to tell a compelling story, not as a lesson in authenticity. They’re rarely trying to be accurate, nor should they be. These stories use the *appearance* of history to create an immersive atmosphere, and that’s enough.\n\nFrom a creative perspective, studios likely don’t aim for accuracy. They want to connect with people emotionally, tell stories that resonate, and make something that feels \"cool.\" Expecting every detail to line up with historical fact seems like missing the point of entertainment. The priority is creating a narrative that engages, not adhering to a checklist of historical precision.\n\nWhat bothers me even more is how critiques of historical inaccuracy often feel politically motivated. For instance, right-wing groups, who frequently twist history to suit their agendas, are among the loudest voices decrying “inaccuracies.” The hypocrisy is astounding. Most media isn’t trying to rewrite history—it’s just creative people doing their best to entertain.\n\nSo, why not embrace this perspective? Why not let creators reinterpret the past however they see fit and judge the media on its emotional and artistic merits, rather than its adherence to historical trivia? It’s entertainment, not a history textbook.\n\nAnd, if we’re being honest, humans are weird about this stuff anyway. But hey, what do I know?

Many budget airlines or even long haul flights actively decide to fly through dangerous airspace rather than make a larger flight path around it to save fuel. If they take this longer route, they would spend more on fuel, flight times would be longer and ticket prices would. need to be higher to compensate.

Airlines have a choice of their own flight path and although the chance might be very small, the fact that they had an alternative choice but didn’t do it puts them at some degree of fault. \n\nEdit 2: I think it is also an ethical question as the risk is definitely there and it is definitely avoidable.

{"Article Number": 239, "title": "CMV: Absolute Free Speech is both stupid and a lie", "article": "A lot of people criticize governments for not allowing absolute free speech (mostly far-right individuals). However, I personally believe that one's freedom ends where it encroaches on the freedoms of others. This is a common proverb in my country. Absolute free speech is paradoxical issue because it would allow speech that advocates for the suppression of speech itself, such as calls for censorship or authoritarian rule. For example, there are people in my country who call for the return of the Ba'ath Party. They certainly shouldn't be allowed to do so, and they aren't. Even though we live in a form of democracy, that doesn't mean far-right parties or remnants of old regimes should have the right to participate in it.\n\nIf we compare, the only significant difference between parties like the AfD and the Ba'ath Party is that the Ba'athists were Socialist-ish. Absolute free speech has allowed harm through the spread of misinformation, hate speech, and dangerous ideologies (such as far-right xenophobia and religious fundamentalism), undermining societal cohesion and trust. It also enables incitement to violence and defamation. For instance, the 2021 riots in Iraq (The government was so busy with the political crisis that it allowed the Media to be fully free like before 2011) and the 2024 UK riots (Mostly Musk allowing it on twitter) demonstrated how misinformation can incite unrest. People criticized both governments for acting against those spreading misinformation, claiming it violated free speech. Legal systems, like those in the UK and Iraq, impose limits on speech to prevent harm, such as slander, misinformation, or incitement to violence. Yet some people argue such measures shouldn't be allowed. However, with rights come responsibilities. Speech that incites violence, spreads misinformation or targets groups because of personal dislike contradicts moral obligations to society.\n\nHistorically, unrestricted hate speech has contributed to atrocities. During the early years of post-2003 Iraq, the US under Bremer and later through Al Maliki let sectarian TV channels and media outlets to be completely free. Which fueled tensions between Sunni and Shia communities, contributing to the violence that accrued. The same thing happened during the Rwandan Genocide, unchecked radio broadcasts (Mostly by the Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines aka Radio Genocide) incited mass killings and violence.\n\nElon Musk's management of Twitter serves as another example of the dangers of inconsistent regulation of speech. While Musk advocates for \"free speech,\" his policies have been criticized as selective, targeting specific groups but he does allow for full absolute free speech in non-English-speaking spaces like Arabic Twitter which is so unregulated and with no restrictions that ISIS accounts are everywhere.\n\nAnd tbh, no society permits absolute free speech. Even in societies like the United States, where free speech is a fundamental right, certain speech, especially in politically sensitive contexts (such as criticism of foreign governments like Israel or criticism of a formerly oppressed group), can face legal restrictions. This reflects the limits on free speech that exist in every society, where speech that undermines national interests or incites unrest can be controlled, even in democracies.\n\n**EDIT: I said absolute Freedom of speech not the Freedom of speech itself**", "authorship": "human"}

This is obviously not the case. And even if we could create an ethical framework through logic, it would depend on axioms, i.e., first principles that are accepted but not proven.

According to Darwin, we exist to pass on our genes, and whatever promotes that is good and whatever restricts it is bad. So ultimately, we have to examine human nature to understand what is good and what is bad. This requires understanding human psychology and biology.  To broaden the lens, we are social animals, and therefore, we live in groups. Promoting the wellbeing of the group therefore is good because it promotes the wellbeing of the individual. How we evaluate individual goals versus those of the group gets into the political.

Those topics are way more complicated so I wanted to focus on the actual issue he mentioned. In this post, I use the terms green card and permanent residency synonymously.  \n\nRight now there are 140k slots annually in the employment route (EB) to get green cards. A max of 7% or 9.8k can go to a single country. This means a country like India that has  hundreds of thousands of applicants have a decades-long queue while other countries get theirs in a couple of years. Realistically any Indian immigrant working in the USA starting this process now won’t get a permanent residency until after they retire in which case they’d no longer have an employer sponsor \n\nThe current system ensures some diversity and a cap of new permanent residents, but that’s about it. I’d argue diversity isn’t a benefit if we want the “most talented” immigrants to have a path towards naturalization. Here are a few reasons why it’s unfair\n\n1) it doesn’t guarantee that the applicants are the top talent in their profession. It’s just whoever applied first\n2) by definition it discriminates based on birth country. At least the h1b is a lottery so it treats everyone more fairly but that also is not meritocratic. While ensuring diversity it also penalizes applicants bc of where they were born which is arguably racist \n3) long PR queues for Indians disincentivizes top talent (all talent which includes the best) from immigrating here which means they’ll stay in India or go elsewhere in the anglosphere.\n4) it doesn’t factor in profession, salary, taxes, or other factors that predict whether they’ll be an assimilated, contributing member of society. There are H1B examples posted recently of mid wage consultants and fraud that can get selected vs someone like Aravind Srinivas, CEO and founder of Perplexity, a $9B dollar company\n5) Businesses need to keep sponsoring H1B for these applicants which is a cost which they could be reinvesting into the company such as creating more jobs. This one is more a minor problem\n6) it doesn’t promote as much competition in the labor market as it could. I believe this would ensure top talent is hired by American companies which helps those companies innovate more, contribute to the economy, and grow the GDP\n\nIt seems like the quotas have not been updated in a while and I’m unsure what’s the point of having a decades long backlog for one country of immigrants. I’d consider my view changed if      \nA) the current system can be shown to benefit the employees, businesses, or the USA  despite these issues    \n   B) these issues are not important enough to warrant reform    \n    C) a meritocratic system would have worse issues than the current system. I recognize defining such a system is hard but I’d imagine it could be done through a combination of university tier (I think the UK does this), compensation, standardized testing, and employer preference and quotas on profession and overall (I am not advocating for opening the flood gates, caps are necessary) Also just because something is hard doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try \n\nThis is also my first post so forgive me if I miss any required formatting or structures in my logic \n\n***EDIT:*** Thanks for the thoughtful replies all. I handed out a few deltas that explain how the current system helps certain groups of people, and how a merit based system would be difficult to administer to warrant the ROI.

Just look at the countless AITA posts where people act with extreme cruelty towards others and get supportive comments because their anger is \"justified\".\n\nBut in the real world anger no longer seems to have much utility. Research has shown that expressing anger (by venting or being physical) only makes it grow. I have never in my life done something out of anger that actually improved my circumstances in the long run. That's not true of any other emotion. Fear helps keep us safe, sadness helps evoke compassion in others, joy feels good and helps us act with compassion ourselves, and disgust keeps us from doing things that are unhealthy or socially unacceptable. Obviously you can be led to damaging behavior from these emotions as well, but their purpose is still very evident. But the only purposes of anger that I can think of are either A) protecting your life in an immediate physical altercation or  B) getting what you want by intimidating someone else. A is valid but rare in modern society. I think there are MUCH less harmful ways to achieve B. \n\nImagine a negotiation. If you are angrily negotiating, you're more likely to get what you want by screwing the other person over. If you're neutral or even joyful, you're more likely to be happy with a result that benefits both of you.\n\nI really do want my views changed because I have a problematic relationship with anger.

I just really believe that as an emotion that drives behavior it is not often useful and much more often damaging. And our thoughts about a situation does inform our feelings about that situation, so I think it's disingenuous to argue that feeling anger is unavoidable or can't be worked on over time. \n\nEdit: I've loved most of the discussion on this post. There are a few ways in which my views have shifted. It seems as though there is a distinction between feeling anger, and feeling angry AT someone else. The latter feels harmful, but the former is simply a way of learning about your own values and motivating yourself to act. Someone also mentioned it as a warning system, which I found very interesting and I think especially if I frame it as a warning system to oneself, I can get on board.

They claim that life begins at conception and that’s when the zygote/embryo/fetus (ZEF) has their own unique set of DNA and is on the path to becoming a fully developed human being, so it is wrong to kill them and strip that potential future away from them.\n\nI’d like to list all of my reasons for why I think pro-lifers are disingenuous:\n\n1) Pro-lifers can’t even prove that abortion bans actually result in a decrease in abortions. \n\nIf anything, abortions have increased since Roe v Wade was overturned in the US. And many of the countries with the highest rates of abortion every year are abortion ban countries. In fact, on average abortion ban countries actually do have more abortions than those without bans. \n\nhttps://www.cfr.org/article/abortion-law-global-comparisons\n\nNow obviously pro-lifers can always say “correlation does not equal causation,” but all that does is attempt to attribute the reason for these increases in abortion rates to something other than the abortion bans. That still doesn’t negate the fact that abortion did increase, which means the ban at the very least certainly didn’t cause any decrease—let alone a significant decrease—in abortions. And it may have even caused the increase. So all we can really conclude is that abortion bans either 1) Do absolutely nothing, not preventing a singular net abortion. Or 2) They actually are counter-productive and might even cause more abortions.\n\nIn addition to this, we also know that any restrictions placed on abortions make it more difficult for women to obtain even the medically necessary abortions, which has harmed and even killed women in abortion ban countries (including a small number in the U.S. so far). So if sacrificing innocent women is worth saving fetal lives, then in my opinion, abortion bans had better save a significant number of fetal lives to make up for the sacrifice of these innocent women. But pro-lifers can’t even prove that abortion bans prevent *any* abortions (net abortions). \n\nSo to me it seems pro-“lifers” are very disingenuous when it comes to “valuing the life of every human being” because not only do abortion bans prevent zero abortions, but they also harm and even kill women in the process. That’s not pro-“life” at all. \n\nAlso, if you really wanted to prevent abortions, then why wouldn’t you advocate for things that we know for a fact prevent abortions WITHOUT harming/killing women as a side effect? The countries with the lowest rates of abortion have things in common: paid maternity leave, free maternal and child healthcare (or just free healthcare in general), free access to all contraceptives, mandated sex education in schools multiple times every semester starting at puberty, and legalized abortions. The countries with all of these things in place have very low abortion rates, without harming/killing women. If people truly were “pro-life,” you’d think they’d advocate for those things to prevent abortion instead of abortion bans. \n\n2) Pro-lifers often argue that the life of the ZEF is equal in value to a born person’s life, therefore the mother’s bodily sovereignty and health are not good enough reasons to justify killing the ZEF. \n\nI don’t believe for one second that pro-lifers actually believe that the life of an embryo has exactly the same value as the life of a born person. If a pro-lifer was in a burning building and they could either save a child or a suitcase with 100,000 embryos in it, they’re going to save the child. I don’t believe for one second that they would choose to save the suitcase and leave the child to die. That’s because we *don’t* value embryos exactly the same as born human beings. If we did, then that hypothetical wouldn’t even be a moral dilemma, it would be an extremely easy choice: save the embryos and leave the child to die. You’re saving 100,000 lives as opposed to 1. But every time I ask this question to pro-lifers (“which one do you save?”) they hesitate and say it’s a hard choice, or they pick the child. If you truly valued an embryo EXACTLY THE SAME as a child, however, then you wouldn’t even hesitate; you’d choose the embryos instantly.  So I don’t believe pro-lifers are being sincere when they say they value ZEFs exactly the same as born people. \n\nIf you wanted to say “well, equal in value or not, they still have value and therefore it’s not right to kill them,” then that’s at least a little more believable. But that’s not what the pro-life camp believes or says in their campaigns. \n\n3) Murder is not the same as abortion, yet pro-lifers pretend that it is. Is it killing a human being intentionally? Yes. Is that always murder? No. If you kill someone intentionally in self-defense, that is not murder. If you kill someone in war, that is also not considered murder but a “casualty” (or a “success” to some). If you euthanize someone to end their suffering, that’s also not murder. If you enact the death penalty on someone, that’s also not murder. So you can’t just say “the premeditated, intentional killing of another human being makes it murder.” No, it doesn’t. And you know that. \n\nThe woman actually has very real reasons for killing the ZEF to preserve her own bodily sovereignty, health, and life. It doesn’t matter how “rare” you think complications during pregnancy and childbirth are. The fact remains that a woman’s health and life are at greater risk while pregnant than if she was not pregnant. She doesn’t want someone living inside of her anymore, and she doesn’t want to give birth. That’s very different from cold-blooded murder just because you want someone to die. She just doesn’t want to be pregnant or give birth, and unfortunately the only way to stop that is to kill the ZEF. So no, that is not the same as murder. And I don’t believe pro-lifers view it the same way either, because you certainly don’t see them grieving the losses of thousands of not millions of ZEF’s every year due to IUDs killing them after fertilization. IUDs usually prevent sperm from reach the egg, but when they fail to do that, they resort to plan B which is to prevent the zygote/embryo’s implantation in the uterus, killing it. Pro-lifers aren’t calling women with IUDs mass murderers, so they obviously don’t actually believe that abortion is murder. \n\n4) The majority of pro-lifers are men. If these pro-life men really wanted to see a decrease in abortions, then they’d need to advocate for a decrease in unwanted pregnancies. The best way to do that is to get vasectomies themselves, if they plan on having sex with women but don’t want to get them pregnant. And they should be encouraging other men to do the same, including pro-choice men who don’t want to get women pregnant but do want to keep having sex. \n\nVasectomies are usually reversible, just depends on your body and how long you’ve had the vasectomy for. But even if it’s not reversible, that doesn’t matter because men can just put their sperm in a sperm bank and freeze it for the future just in case. We can also extract sperm from the testes or epididymis, so no matter what men will never be sterilized by vasectomies. And VasalGel will be perfected soon and marketable. But whenever I make these suggestions that men should be encouraged to *actually contribute* if they want abortions to decrease, pro-life men always respond that that’s an attack on *their* bodily autonomy. Given what they’re advocating for?? That’s extremely disingenuous. \n\nI have more reasons honestly but I’ll just stick to these main 4 reasons for now. Change My View.\n\n", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 261, "title": "CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior", "article": "DISCLAIMER: I'm atheist\n\nI’ve been reflecting on the moral implications of religious exclusivity, particularly when it comes to salvation. Many Abrahamic religions—Christianity, Islam, and to some extent, Judaism—teach that belief in a specific deity or following a particular path is necessary for eternal reward. This strikes me as morally problematic, especially when compared to the more inclusive or flexible perspectives found in many Eastern religions like Buddhism, Hinduism, and Zoroastrianism.\n\nIn Christianity, for example, salvation is often contingent on accepting Jesus as a savior. Depending on the denomination, this belief excludes billions of people worldwide, regardless of their moral character or good deeds. Islam similarly requires belief in Allah and the prophethood of Muhammad as a fundamental condition for salvation. While Judaism places less emphasis on salvation in the afterlife, it carries the idea of a chosen people, who are put into direct contrast with \"gentiles.\" This framework seems inherently unfair. Why should someone’s birthplace or exposure to a particular religion determine their spiritual fate?\n\nIn contrast, many Eastern religions take a different approach. Buddhism does not rely on a judging deity and sees liberation (nirvana) as attainable through understanding, practice, and moral conduct rather than doctrinal belief. Hinduism, while diverse in its teachings, emphasizes karma (actions) and dharma (duty) over allegiance to any single deity. Even Zoroastrianism, while it believes non-believers to be misguided, centers salvation on ethical behavior—good thoughts, good words, and good deeds—rather than tribal or doctrinal exclusivity. You can see the trend continue with Sikhism, Jainism, Ba'hai faith, and virtually all other Eastern religions (I didn't include Confucianism or Daoism because they are not religions, I shouldn't have even included Buddhism either). These perspectives prioritize personal actions and intentions over adherence to specific religious dogma. As an Asian, I recognize\n\nThe exclusivity found in many Abrahamic religions feels arbitrary and, frankly, unjust. It implies that morality and virtue are secondary to belonging to the right group or reciting the right creed. Why should someone who has lived an ethical and compassionate life be condemned simply because they didn’t believe in a specific deity, while a believer who acts unethically is rewarded? This seems to place tribalism above justice and fairness.\n\nAm I missing something here? Is there a compelling moral justification for these exclusivist doctrines that doesn’t rely on arbitrariness or tribalism? Is there a way to reconcile the idea of exclusive salvation with a broader sense of justice and fairness? CMV.", "authorship": "human"}

After all, the demons are a bit like the Myrmarachne spiders that mimic ants in order to invade their colonies and eat their larvae. From the ants' perspective, the spiders aren't even necessarily \"evil\" - the two animals just want mutually incompatible things. One to eat, and the other to not be eaten.\n\nHowever, I think if the elves and humanity were ever to have a position of signifigant strength over the demons, it might make sense to offer the demons clemency in exchange for a regular diet of death row inmates or conquered foreign humans. The reason they might want to do that is because it seems clear that demons are uniquely capable of inovating spells, and while humans and elves have learned a lot as the enemies of demonkind - I think they could learn even more as \"tamers\" of demonkind working alongside them in a more orderly arrangement.\n\nUnfortunately, I think that the humans and elves of Frieren are still on the back foot, even with the defeat of the Demon King, and so the current best solution for them is to kill every demon on sight. However, if they managed to decimate enough of the demonic forces, I think it would make perfect sense to try to turn a small group of suriviving demons into a research team to improve knowledge of magic.

I dont speak any languages other than these two, though i was taught chinese as a toddler living in Singapore (i dont remember which chinese language it was sorry), i did have to learn french in primary and middle school, and i took a spanish class at university. \n\n\nWe all know that english is an absolute mess of a language. Its not phonetic at all, and there's crazy homonyms and homophones, and all in all, english is straight up terrifying to people who weren't raised speaking it (though an unfortunate necessity for many people), and i have a lot of admiration for people who take it upon themselves to learn english, especially my mum.\n\n\nOne thing i think english does do very well though, is that i think the latin alphabet is a really nice clear writing system. My biggest wish is that every letter always made the same sound. Fortunately there is a language where that phenomena exists, and its turkish. My turkish is b1/b2 ish, and the biggest thing holding me back is that i have quite a small vocabulary, because i mostly just use it to speak to my family, and my family are cuddly and love allah, so theres not a ton of diverse conversations happening there. I can however,  pronounce every single turkish word, including ones i havent encountered before, because the ş will always make a sh sound, the c a j sound, so on and so forth for our entire alphabet. \n\n\nTurkish has root words, suffixes and prefixes, same as english, and i think those are all also very helpful to language learners. We don't have gendered pronouns, but you might find that a pain anyway.

While both of these answers are completely valid reasons for wearing makeup -  most are not willing to admit that at the core of their justification still lies an inherent willingness to leave an impression on others.\n\nThe act of applying makeup is inherently and intuitively tied to the concept of being seen. If there were no-one else to witness the makeup, I'm willing to bet most people wouldn't bother at all. The entire point of makeup is to enhance features, conceals flaws, or align the wearer with a specific aesthetic - which are all qualities dictated by evolving societal standards.\n\nFor those who claim to wear makeup solely to boost their self-confidence (and apply it completely alone), I would argue that they are still adhering to society’s standards of beauty—just without an audience. Whether it’s enhancing a specific feature or achieving a particular aesthetic, the confidence they gain from makeup ultimately STILL stems from societal ideals of what is deemed attractive or desirable. These values, deeply ingrained by their culture / society, shape their perception of beauty and influence what they choose to alter with make up.\n\nThose who claim they use makeup as a form of artistic self-expression or to showcase individuality often derive their self-confidence from the belief that their creativity or uniqueness will be appreciated by others—even if their makeup is meant to defy societal norms.

Being legalized didn't stop the Haitians of Springfield from being labelled as illegal dog eaters.\n2. **Immigrants are paid less and suffer more labor abuses than natives, regardless of the country they go to**. Not to mention that they are more susceptible to slave labor, meaning that they will be in a much worse situation than in their country of origin. The current discourse over H1-B passports has a background of large corporations encouraging highly qualified professionals to migrate to work more and earn less than Americans. Cheap labor without means of defending oneself.\n3. **They are considered second or third-class citizens even though they can pass themselves off as natives.** One example of this is the dekasseguis, Brazilian-Japanese who, although they look Japanese, when they immigrate, are treated with the same disdain as other ethnic groups because, even though they look Japanese, their habits, way of speaking, and even their names are not Japanese. Their children are bullied for not being Japanese enough.\n4. **No one will recognize their importance to the country to which they emigrate.** Does any American recognize or show gratitude for the army of Latinos who work in the fields to provide them with fresh fruits and vegetables every day? Does any Brit acknowledge the importance of Polish truck drivers in delivering goods and services? Does any Frenchman extol how his country is a sports powerhouse thanks to Africans? No.\n5. **Immigrants are always one election away from being deported for any odd reason**. It doesn't matter if the government is the reincarnation of Hitler or the most egalitarian socialist paradise you can imagine, the rights of those who migrate can be taken away in the blink of an eye without any second thought. Several European countries are already considering (or have tried) to make applications wait in African countries before entering the countries; Xenophobic parties are on the rise all over the world calling for mass deportations, remigration and denaturalization of legalized citizens.\n6. **Immigrants are reminded daily that they do not belong there even if they obtain citizenship.** An ID card is just a piece of plastic. If you're going to spend Christmas with a white family and you're the only brown person who speaks with an accent, they don't care if you've lived in the country for 25 years. You're still not like them. They may not be as hostile as the KKK, but they will remember you for the little things.\n\nNote: My argument is for *voluntary permanent migration*. I am not talking about forced migration due to wars or requests for asylum. In these cases, there is a justifiable and rational reason, which is self-preservation. This is very different from wanting a bigger house or his children to live \"in a better place.\"\n\nThe stress that immigrants constantly suffer does not compensate for any benefits they would enjoy. Even if I were rich, I would never leave my country so that some idiot would spit in my face and say, \"Go back to your country.\" No country treats and respects its immigrants (and I include mine as well).

There's been a lot of pushes for urban density and denser housing. A lot of people are making suburbs out to be some kind of ultra isolated liminal spaces and I'm left wondering what the issue is. \n\nNow, before we go further, I do understand and acknowledge the criticisms. It can make things very car dependent but a lot of suburban kids get sent to school on a schoolbus. To my mind, if you can get a schoolbus there, you can create a regular bus route. I also understand that it's almost impossible to live the same life on a single income these days but advocating for higher wages is not a bad thing. Also, with the advent of the internet, things are nowhere near as isolated.\n\nSo with that in mind. What's wrong with the suburbs. I would love a house on a hill with a yard, a couple cars, a trampoline for my kids and a bit of distance from the big city hustle and bustle. There's improvements that could easily be made.\n\nEDIT: People are pointing out that I got a bit sidetracked and focused more on suburban life than the family aspect. That's actually very fair, I'll address that more focused here. \n\nThe \"Nuclear Family\" can be bound up in 50s imagery and that can have some negative connotations relating to race and gender equality issues. I'm absolutely not ignoring that but I also think we can have nuclear families without those issues these days. For example, two wives/husbands and their kids living together are also a \"Nuclear Family\", as far as I'm concerned. I consider a woman who works and a stay at home dad with their kids to also be a nuclear family. Also, I ABSOLUTELY do not consider it to only be white people. \n\nI think if you want to be poly, or live with a huge family, ie: grandparents, aunt and uncle's, as is common in parts of Asia, that's fine. I also would much prefer not to do that. \n\nI'd absolutely never allow my parents to hang out to dry in the cold but I don't want to live with adult sibling, their kids, grandparents etc, as a standard.

I don't see what's wrong with that.\n\nI know that those who want to \"Go back to a better times\" are often saying that they only want one type of lifestyle to be accepted and treated with respect. I'm absolutely not saying that, I want you to be respected for whatever home you choose to build for yourself.

{"Article Number": 288, "title": "CMV: It is more valuable for children to received a few meaningful gifts, than an abundance of many less significant gifts.", "article": "  \nContext: I like keeping holiday gifting to kids small and simple with a few high meaning items being gifted to our kids. Spouse has a preference for overabundance of gifts. With the below, I argue some important factors that show the value keeping gifting small can add to children.  \n  \nI've had a difficult time accepting the contrast of how my spouse family gifts vs how i experienced gifting growing up.  Siblings and I used to receive a few gifts that were extremely meaningful, gifts that we often valued for years because of their uniqueness/value/rarity/significance.  Now in contrast, my children receive mountains of gifts, many that are unique/valuable/rare/ and even significant, but due to the sheer quantity of them, they might not be as much appreciated compared to having them being more concentrated and special.\n\nFor that reason, teaching kids the value of gifting a few, high-meaning holiday/birthday/etc gifts, as opposed to showering them with many, offers benefits that can shape their character and foster a deeper appreciation for the true spirit of the season.\n\n**Important Values Taught by Gifting a Few, High-Meaning Gifts:**\n\n1. **Appreciation:** When children receive a few, carefully chosen gifts, they learn to appreciate each one more deeply. They have time to savor the experience, explore the gift's unique qualities, and develop a sense of gratitude for the thought and effort behind it.  \n   1. Context for last point:  50 varied Pokémon figurines, when 1 or 2 favorite or unique ones would help the child appreciate it  more.\n2. **Thoughtfulness:** Selecting a few meaningful gifts encourages children to think about the recipient's interests, needs, and desires. It teaches them to consider the person they are giving to, rather than simply focusing on the act of giving itself.  \n3. **Value over Quantity:** By emphasizing the significance of a few special gifts, children learn that quality trumps quantity. They begin to understand that true value lies not in the number of possessions but in their meaning and purpose.\n   1. Context for last two points:  Also related to appreciation, and sticking with Pokémon as an example.  Sure you can gift a child 3 of their favorite specific Pokemon, but getting them the ONE that they have been expecting, loving, talking about etc will demonstrate that through was put into it and not just being a quantity element.\n4. **Reduced Consumerism:** A smaller number of gifts helps counteract the culture of consumerism and waste that often surrounds the holiday season. Children learn that happiness doesn't come from accumulating material possessions but from experiences, relationships, and meaningful connections.\n5. **Financial Responsibility:** Focusing on a few gifts can also teach children about financial responsibility. They see that resources are limited and that thoughtful spending leads to more meaningful experiences than impulsive purchases.\n   1. Context for last two points: Waste, excessive consumerism, and financial responsibility are lessons that can also be instilled by this.  Again, to say in Pokémon example, does the 4 year old child really NEED to have 9 different variations of x Pokémon?\n\n**How This Approach Helps Children Grow Up with More Appreciation:**\n\nChildren who learn to value a few, high-meaning gifts are more likely to:\n\n* Develop a deeper appreciation for the people in their lives and the thoughtfulness behind their gifts.\n* Find joy in experiences and relationships rather than material possessions.\n* Be more mindful consumers, making conscious choices about what they truly need and value.\n* Cultivate a sense of gratitude for what they have, rather than always wanting more.\n* Develop a stronger sense of empathy and consideration for others.\n\n**The Problem with Excessive Gifting:**\n\nIn contrast, showering children with a multitude of less meaningful gifts can:\n\n* Lead to a sense of entitlement and a lack of appreciation for what they receive.\n* Foster a focus on material possessions and instant gratification.\n* Contribute to a culture of waste and environmental damage.\n* Create a disconnect between the giver and the receiver, as gifts become less about personal connection and more about fulfilling a perceived obligation.\n\n**Conclusion/Reasoning:**\n\nTeaching kids the value of gifting a few, high-meaning holiday gifts is a powerful way to instill important values and foster a deeper appreciation for the true spirit of the season.   \n  \nBy emphasizing quality over quantity, thoughtfulness over impulse quantity over quality gifting, and experiences over material possessions, we can help children grow up with a greater sense of gratitude, empathy, and responsibility.   \n  \nThe main reason for this is that this approach not only benefits children but also contributes to a more sustainable (less financial/ecological waste) and meaningful (holiday season / birth day / show of care) for everyone.  Lastly, children can also instill these values to their own children once they reach that point themselves.", "authorship": "human"}

For a comparison, people today view Trump as dangerous because of talk about jailing political opponents (which is certainly frightening to think about), but Lincoln went much further in that he actually arrested dissenters who weren’t otherwise accused of crimes and then took away their right to sue for their freedom (again even if they weren’t accused of a crime). You could literally sit in a jail for months without a trial under Lincoln without being accused of a crime, so long as you disagreed with him regarding the war or certain policies. To be clear, he was not just jailing people who said “I’m going to fight for the confederates,” but rather anyone considered to be expressing opinions aligned with the Confederacy. Maybe that sounds fine at first, but remember, there was no trial and there was no First Amendment protection at all - if you were suspected, you could sit in jail indefinitely.\n\nThen, after Chief Justice Taney held that this was unconstitutional in *Ex parte Merryman*, Lincoln ignored the ruling, permanently undermining the separation of powers for the sake of a massive human rights violation that he thought he was justified in committing. \n\nOf course, I don’t mean to label Lincoln as a terrible President and I appreciate his accomplishments, but I would make the argument that he should not be considered among the best, because if he had been President at any other time in history I think he would’ve been viewed as a tyrant much like John Adams was in his time (who also imprisoned political dissenters).\n\nYou could CMV by presenting other great Presidents (such as Washington or Jefferson) as having bigger flaws that actually make them worse than Lincoln, or at least make it a close contest.\n\nYou could possibly CMV by showing that the ends justified the means in this case, but I’d be highly skeptical of an argument saying it’s acceptable for a President to completely ignore the judiciary or to imprison people solely for speech that doesn’t directly incite or threaten lawless action. \n\nI would say my view would not be changed by comparing Lincoln to other wartime Presidents, such as FDR, Truman, or Wilson, as I regard all of these as pretty awful, like all in my bottom 10.

It should not under any circumstances be applies on the basis of ethnicity, race, or any similar immutable trait that doesn't carry health implications. I understand the presence of systemic bigotries may still cause such methods to be more common among certain demographics, this is a problem with the system requiring policy change, not a flaw inherent to the principle.\n\nI say this from the perspective of someone with ASD and GD, my own standards would predicate I should not have been born. That is exactly why I advocate this position. I believe it was an ethical abomination that I have been forced to endure a reduced quality of life, and wish that I had simply been aborted.\n\nEDIT: SatisfactoryLoaf made the point that the abortion proposal would satisfy these goals on their own, meaning that it is not strictly necessary to incentivize sterilization and thereby invite the associated bioethical problems.

{"Article Number": 294, "title": "CMV: Straight men and women can generally not be close friends.", "article": "This is the age old debate. Reddit seems to be pretty adamant about the fact they can be friends while IRL has a pretty solid split and any given person could answer this question any which way. \n\nAlso, for the purposes of this post, being a close friend includes things like one on one hangouts and physical affection that would otherwise be normal between same sex friends and other things like complementing outfits etc etc. \n\nHere's my thinking as to why they generally can't be friends. Essentially, it boils down to societal norms. There are just certain things you do at certain times and also certain things you do with different people. Like for example, if a woman is sitting at a cafe scrolling on her laptop, walking at university or at a park, or is out shopping and a man just introduces himself, she will assume, and usually be right about, that he is coming with sexual intentions. She would not assume this of another woman in almost any case, right? \n\nSecondly, once a straight person is in a relationship, it can often make it look suspicious when they hang out with people of the opposite sex. Hanging out alone together gives a public appearance of inappropriateness generally speaking. \n\nAlso, another thing is that complementing your opposite sex friend is seen as sexual generally speaking. Let's say that you're a guy whose genuinely friends with an objectively attractive woman wearing a tanktop and daisy dukes or something revealing like that. If you say \"I love your outfit\", she will likely take it as sexual interest. That's just the reality. \n\nTo further illustrate this, let's say you have a woman who secretly is into said woman and said man is not into her at all. If both give the same complement, she will assume it's the man who's interested even though she's wrong in this case. That is just the strength of our societal standards. \n\nOr better yet, try replacing the outfit compliments above with a complement like \"I love your eyes\" or \"I love your hair today.\" Assuming that nobody in this scenario has revealed their orientations, if a man or woman give this compliment to the same woman, she's going to assume the woman is being friendly and the man is making a move. \n\nOf course, there's differences in physical affection too. If a woman hugs another woman for a good minute, that is seen as friendly but if a man were to do it, it would (usually rightfully) be seen as an indicator of sexual interest. \n\nThe point is this: A lot of things that each genders do in their same sex friendships would be seen as \"making a move\" in an opposite sex friendships. Especially if we look at the stuff normal in female friendships. If a man were to try such things with his female friend, those are (again, usually rightfully) seen as making a move. \n\nAlso, I think most counterarguments are weaker than most make it out to be. First off, the bisexuals exist argument. First off, the two people in this scenario are straight. \"What if I was not straight\" is not a valid argument if you are straight and if you're trying to justify your friendship, you should be able to do so in reality and not need to resort to different hypotheticals. You should be able to justify your opposite sex friendship in this reality where you *are* straight. And the reality is this: *a bisexual person's inability to make a friend group with people of sexes they're not attracted to does not preclude that a straight person is able to and thus can be held accountable to that standard.* If you're straight, you *can* do this and are liable to be obligated to do so. \n\nSecondly, different orientations have had different social norms forever and there's no reason this needs to be a problem. For example, it's normal for gay men to be invited to all woman gatherings but straight men generally are not. So, just based off of that, it is totally fine for differing orientations to have differing social norms. \n\nAs far as bisexual individuals go, there's no rule that a societal norm regarding straight people to be perfectly analagous and translatable to bisexual people. They are differing orientations and can have different rules societally as far as friendships goes. And as I said before, a bisexual person's inability to make a friend group with people of sexes they're not attracted to does not preclude that a straight person is able to and thus can be held accountable to that standard.", "authorship": "human"}
{"Article Number": 295, "title": "CMV: Subscriptions are better than owning in most situations, people just want stuff for free", "article": "Many people push back against subscriptions because they see them as a way for companies to milk more money out of consumers, but in most cases, subscriptions are genuinely better than outright ownership. Take the recent uproar over BMW's heated seat subscription as an example. Critics claimed it was a greedy move, but when you break it down, it makes sense. The hardware for heated seats may already be installed in the car, but the cost to include and maintain that feature isn’t negligible. A subscription lets you activate the feature only when you need it—like during winter—rather than paying a large upfront cost for something you might rarely use. This approach not only gives consumers flexibility but also allows BMW to keep the base price of their cars lower by not charging everyone for features they may never want. Just because the feature is physically present doesn’t mean consumers are entitled to unlimited use without contributing to the cost of its development and maintenance. If BMW can't charge for the heated seats they just won't include it or charge a fixed fee like before. They aren't going just give it away. \n\nThis subscription model works especially well for software and technology, which are constantly evolving. Fixed-price products don’t make sense because they become outdated or require continuous updates to remain functional and secure. Subscriptions provide companies with the resources to keep improving their offerings while spreading the cost over time. Yes, companies can raise prices, but that often reflects the value of ongoing updates and improvements that keep the product relevant and useful. For services requiring continuous maintenance or innovation, subscriptions are far more practical than one-time payments. While people dislike subscriptions because they feel like an endless drain, they often pay for themselves in flexibility, innovation, and access to better services.\n\nMany also assume that buying a product or a one-time license should entitle them to updates and support forever, but that’s just not sustainable. Software, for instance, requires constant maintenance to adapt to new threats and evolving technology, and that ongoing work needs funding. Subscriptions make it possible for companies to deliver better, more secure products instead of leaving users with outdated or unsupported versions. Take music as another example. In the past, buying an album or song meant sticking to what you knew because adding more music to your collection was expensive. Today, streaming services allow you to discover endless new songs, artists, and genres for a fraction of the cost of buying individual tracks. Subscriptions enable this kind of variety and flexibility that one-time purchases can’t replicate.\n\nThat said, there’s room for balance. We should advocate for stronger laws protecting ownership and the right to repair so that consumers aren’t unfairly locked out of what they’ve paid for. I'm also for more rent to own situations with software were we have laws protecting current versions that you pay for a certain amount of time. After five years for example that software version you use, can be retain without the company bricking the software just cause. \n\nHowever, it’s also important to acknowledge the role that cheapness plays in these debates. People often rail against subscriptions not because the model is inherently flawed but because they simply don’t want to pay for things. If we want access to better services, continued innovation, and fair practices, we need to be willing to have an honest conversation about what we value and how much we’re willing to pay to sustain it.\n\n", "authorship": "human"}

However, I also believe that the celebration of such violence reflects deeper cultural attitudes that prioritize bodily autonomy and healthcare access in ways that can justify or romanticize violent acts. I don’t want to focus on the specific case of the murder of Brian Thompson but instead how a broader ethical framework can lead to morally dangerous justifications of violence.\n\nThe pro-choice ethical framework rests on the principle of bodily autonomy—the idea that individuals should have the right to control their bodies, free from interference, and this often extends to the idea that people should have access to healthcare, including abortion. I believe abortion is the murder of an innocent life, but within the pro-choice movement, bodily autonomy and healthcare access are framed as essential rights. This framing elevates personal rights above the value of life itself, which I think can create a moral environment where extreme actions—like those committed by Mangione—are viewed as justified and even celebrated.\n\nLuigi Mangione’s violent act of murder, which targeted a healthcare CEO, was rooted in his belief that the healthcare system was denying people access to necessary care, something he saw as an infringement on their autonomy. While no one in the pro-choice movement openly advocates for murder, the same logic that justifies abortion—prioritizing bodily autonomy over the sanctity of life—can extend to the justification of other violent actions in the name of resistance against oppressive systems, including the healthcare system.\n\nI believe abortion is the deliberate taking of innocent life, and I do not think we can draw a clear moral distinction between the devaluation of life in the case of abortion and the devaluation of life in cases like Mangione’s. I also recognize that many people within the pro-choice movement do not condone violence, but the underlying ethical framework that elevates bodily autonomy to the highest moral good can inadvertently encourage a mindset where violent actions are justified in the name of defending these 'rights.'\n\nI recognize that this is a controversial view, but I believe it is an important one to discuss. Am I wrong to draw this connection between the pro-choice framework and the celebration of violence against those perceived as standing in the way of autonomy and healthcare access?

{"Article Number": 310, "title": "CMV: The Democrats are not a \"right-wing\" party and are not out of step with center-left parties in other developed countries.", "article": "This is something you here all the time on Reddit, and from people on the left generally, that the Democrats are actually a \"right-wing\" party on the international level and somehow their policies would be center right in other post-industrial democracies. People can arguable about the specifics of \"right-wing\" and \"left-wing\" so the more precise case I'm making is that the policy goals of the Democratic party are not out of step or somehow way further to the right compared to other mainstream, center-left parties in Europe or other Western democracies. If the policies of the Democratic party were transported to the United Kingdom or Germany, they would be much closer to Labour or the SPD and aren't going to suddenly fit right in with the Tories or the CDU. \n\nI will change my view if someone can read the [2024 Democratic platform](https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FINAL-MASTER-PLATFORM.pdf) and tell me what specific policy proposals in there would not be generally supported by center-left parties in Europe or other Western democracies. \n\nIn 2020, Biden ran on a platform that included promises like raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, providing universal pre-k, making community college and public four year universities free, creating a public option for health insurance, among other things. Biden's primary legislative accomplishments were passing massive fiscal stimulus through the American Rescue Plan and infrastructure law and a major subsidies for green energy through the Inflation Reduction Act. He also expended a bunch of political capital on a plan for widespread student loan forgiveness that even other Democratic politicians conceded went beyond the scope of the Executive Branch's powers. I don't see how any of these things can be considered remotely right-wing. Even left-wing commentators like Ezra Klein at the New York Times have said that the Biden administration has been the most progressive administration ever in American history.\n\nI think the assertion that Democrats are \"right-wing\" is mostly the result of people fundamentally misunderstanding the major differences between the American political system and the parliamentary systems practices in most other western democracies. The filibuster makes it so, that in practice, any major policy proposal requires bipartisan support. The last time the Democrats had a filibuster proof majority was back in 2009, which they promptly lost in like a year after a special election in Massachusetts. With their filibuster proof majority, the Democrats used it to pass the Affordable Care Act. Say what you will about the ACA, you can believe it didn't go far enough, but I don't really see how it be remotely construed as \"right-wing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the majority party in most parliamentary systems is able to pass pretty much whatever they want with a 50%+1 majority, provided they can get their party/coalition in line. The logic people seem to employ when they argue that the Democrats are right-wing are they identify progressive policies that America doesn't have that other countries do have like single-payer healthcare, universal parental leave, etc and then reason backwards to conclude that the Democrats must be right-wing. But the Democrats explicitly call for many of these policies in their party platform, it's just virtually impossible to pass most of these things because of the Senate filibuster. \n\nAs an additional note about healthcare, it's worth pointing out that many European countries do not have nationalized, single-payer systems use a mix of private and public healthcare options. The big examples are Germany and Switzerland. Even countries with single-payer systems like Canada still use private health insurance for prescription drugs and dental work. Just because the Democrats seem confused on whether they want to whole-heartedly embrace as Sanders style \"medicare for all\" isn't prima facia evidence that the party would somehow be right-wing in Europe. \n\nFinally, the Democratic party is arguably much further to the left on many social issues. One of the biggest examples is abortion. It's not clear what, if any, restrictions on abortion that Democratic party endorses. In states that have a Democratic trifecta in the governor's mansion and supermajorities in both houses of the state legislature, abortions are often effectively legal at any point, provided you can find a sympathetic doctor to provide a \"good-faith\" medical judgement that completing the pregnancy would harm the health of the mother. \n\nThe viability standard set in Casey of around 24 weeks gave the US a significantly more generous timeframe to get an elective abortion, whereas most European countries cap it [around 12 weeks](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1268439/legal-abortion-time-frames-in-europe/). Many European countries also require [mandatory counseling or waiting periods](https://reproductiverights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/European-abortion-law-a-comparative-review.pdf) before women can get abortions, something the Democrats routinely object to. For comparison, the [position](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/15/europe/germany-abortion-recommendation-intl/index.html) of the Germany's former left-wing governing coalition was the abortions up until 12 weeks should be available on demand, provided the woman receives mandatory counseling and waits for three days. If a Republican state set up that standard in the US, the democrats would attack it relentlessly as excessively draconian, which is precisely what they've done to North Carolina, which has an extremely similar [abortion law](https://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/en/abortion-guide-access) on the books.", "authorship": "human"}

It's become sort of an echo chamber for those ideas, and alternative views really don't get much traction.\n\nFirst off, many of the most popular subreddits on Reddit have to do with progressive or socialist issues. Places like r/politics, r/antiwork, and r/latestagecapitalism are filled with posts railing against capitalism, billionaires, and big corporations. The discussions go beyond just pointing out problems, too—they can get really extreme. You see and hear people quite vociferously saying that billionaires don't deserve to exist and calling CEOs-bankrupting industries for profit, specifically the ones dealing in healthcare-are something people say quite easily; from basic 'Billionaires deserves to lose everything' comments up to and including outright physical or other forms of suggested violence. These posts gain thousands of upvotes, so they are on the front page, reinforcing the leftist vibe.\n\nThe voting system on Reddit makes the echo chamber effect even worse. If someone posts a comment or opinion that doesn't fit the dominant narrative-like a conservative or moderate take-it's usually downvoted so hard it disappears. On the other side, everything that corresponds to the popular left-leaning view is upvoted and moved to the top. That means just one side of the argument is really seen, while opposing viewpoints get buried or ignored. Over time, this just discourages people with different perspectives from even bothering to engage. Why post something if it's just going to get downvoted into oblivion?\n\nThen, of course, there is the huge role of moderation in giving shape to the overall tone of the platform. Large subreddits are run by their moderators, who are themselves often very left-leaning. They can be very quick to remove posts or ban users if they don't agree with the content, even when it doesn't break any rules. Such moderation makes a one-sided space where alternative viewpoints are not just unpopular but also actively suppressed. It's unsurprising that people view Reddit as a hostile place for anyone who doesn't align with progressive values.\n\nAnother reason has to do with the makeup of the site's users: The users go for a younger, more technologically hip audience that can easily go to the left on social issues and politics. Users interact and upvote this content as it speaks for their views, only to increase the presence of the left on this site. Now, for those right-leaning areas of Reddit-areas such as r/Conservative or r/libertarian-they exist but pale in size to the big left leaning behemoths.\n\nAt the end of the day, Reddit is not completely bereft of other viewpoints, but the way the site is structured makes it incredibly hard for them to be heard. From the voting system to the heavy-handed moderation to the demographics of the user base, Reddit has devolved into a leftist echo chamber where everything else is drowned out. No surprise there, really, when people think of it that way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I guess I was wrong in my statement that Reddit is a far left echo chamber. I should of said that Reddit is a liberal echo chamber, that leans left and has some far left tendencies.\n\n\n\nEdit 2: I need to clarify that I meant far left by American standards.\n\n\nEdit 3: seems mods are deleting every comment that agrees and they deleted this post, this proves my point about this website.

It is my stance that it is not in any way immoral to BE a pedophile, as in, to be sexually attracted to minors is not something a person can help, and in fact is a mental health issue deserving of a lot of care in addressing, as it can cause a lot of anguish. Obviously I condemn anybody, pedophile or not, who sexually abuses anyone, and especially someone as incapable of defending themselves as a Child. I also strongly condemn both the creation of CSAM, which is an especially nasty form of child sexual abuse in and of itself, and the consumption of CSAM, as it directly contributes to the creation of CSAM. I also am not a pedophile, I do consider myself quite empathetic to their plight though, especially as someone who has grown up being told their sexual desires were abhorrent, the key difference obviously being that sexually abusing children IS actually abhorrent, whereas my own (being bisexual) obviously are not by any facts based stance on morality.\n\nMy main argument is that Lolicon is victimless, and there will always be people seeking it out, pedophiles will always exist, and insofar as it keeps them from engaging with actual CSAM, it may be arguably actively beneficial, just as in an arguably slightly less extreme example, someone with a rape fetish may find it beneficial to watch rape roleplay porn or roleplay it with a partner, rather than, y'know, actually be raped or rape.\n\nI have been called a lot of names for holding this view, pedo apologist, pedo in denial, etc. so if anyone could convince me why this relatively very unpopular stance isn't the morally consistent stance I think it is, then I would absolutely love to have my mind changed.", "authorship": "human"}
{"Article Number": 314, "title": "CMV: People being shirtless in crowds at concerts are inconsiderate.", "article": "I’ve been to too many concerts where I end up pressed against a shirtless guy and I get covered in a sweaty slick. I’m not naive, I know people sweat and clothes are wet and getting pressed against sweaty people is inevitable. But there is a distinct difference between touching sweat absorbed into clothing (even if the clothing is saturated) and being pressed into sweaty skin. It’s like being pressed against a 200 pound snail.\n\nEven wearing a tank top is better than someone shirtless because at least the main mass of their back and chest has some type of layer. Tank tops aren’t perfect but I’m willing to accept that. But it’s preferable to have sleeves so armpits aren’t out either, especially if you’re a person that spends a lot of time with your hands in the air.\n\nThis doesn’t just apply to men, women sweat too. Women wearing just bathing suit tops in crowds is the same thing. \n\nThere’s also a lot of unclenliness that goes along with bare backs and shoulders. Acne is one. As someone that suffers from a decent amount of body acne, I would be mortified if I was rubbing back zits against strangers that are shoved up against me. \n\nIt’s not the appearance of someone topless that bothers me. I’m a proponent of body positivity and if you’re comfortable being shirtless at a festival out of the crowd because you’re trying to cool down then it’s no problem. But if you’re gonna get in the crowd where you are going to be smushed against people, I believe it’s considerate to put on some type of shirt or top.\n\nA point a friend of mine raised is what about bald people, they sweat through their heads, must they wear hats? My answer is it’s not inconsiderate to be bald without a hat in a crowd because that’s a hairstyle that for many is inevitable or they shave it for personal reasons or whatever. I can live with that. Heads are also significantly smaller than a torso and generally more sanitary. Same thing for arms and legs. \n\nEdit: thank you everyone for participating. Though I still consider it a personal pet peeve and would love for wearing shirts at concerts/festivals to become a norm for my own personal reasons, I have conceded and awarded deltas for two reasons.\n\n1. Not enough people have raised this as a legitimate problem for it to become a social norm that people should wesr shirts. If it’s not a social norm then someone cannot be aware of it and decide to violate it anyway. Thus, it can’t be deemed “inconsiderate” per se.\n\n2. Someone brought up that there are really small venues where you can’t really avoid being squeezed together and they can get really hot. This means that someone pretty much cannot choose to take their shirt off outside of the crowd if they’re getting too hot. Since it’s pretty much an unavoidable occurrence in this case, it counts as an exception. Since I made a blanket statement insinuating that it’s always inconsiderate, the exception means my view has been technically kind of changed. I still think people should wear shirts in crowds at festivals and large concerts, but for the sake of the wording of my original view I awarded a delta.\n\n", "authorship": "human"}
{"Article Number": 315, "title": "CMV: The risk of capital flight from the United States as a response to higher taxes is overstated. ", "article": "Implementing a Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) of 0.5% on stock, bond, and derivative trades could generate approximately $900 billion in annual revenue for the United States, based on current trading volumes. While this would represent a significant change in market structure, particularly for high-frequency trading, the revenue potential is immense given the massive daily volume of financial transactions.\n\nCapital flight concerns often treat global finance as if it operates purely on mathematical optimization of tax rates, but this overlooks the deep structural advantages and institutional power the United States holds in the global financial system. Here's why the risk is likely overstated:\n\nFirst, the United States offers unique advantages that go far beyond tax rates:\n\nThe dollar's role as the global reserve currency gives U.S. financial markets unparalleled liquidity and stability. This status is deeply entrenched through the petrodollar system and the dominance of dollar-denominated international trade. When most global transactions ultimately need to clear in dollars, there's a natural gravitational pull toward U.S. financial institutions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's position as the de facto central bank of the world economy became clear during the 2008 financial crisis and again during the COVID-19 pandemic, when dollar swap lines proved crucial for global financial stability. This creates strong incentives for major financial institutions to maintain robust U.S. operations to ensure access to Fed facilities and dollar liquidity.\n\nNew York's role as a global financial command center brings network effects that are difficult to replicate elsewhere. The concentration of expertise, supporting services (legal, accounting, consulting), and decision-making power creates an ecosystem that reinforces itself. Moving operations to tax havens like Dublin or Luxembourg means giving up these advantages.\n\nBeyond pure economics, the U.S. offers unparalleled political stability and rule of law. The U.S. legal system, particularly New York state courts, is the preferred venue for complex financial disputes globally. This institutional trust took centuries to build and isn't easily replicated.\n\nThe proposed 0.5% financial transaction tax is modest compared to these structural advantages. While it may affect some high-frequency trading strategies, it's unlikely to fundamentally alter the calculus for major financial institutions whose operations are deeply embedded in the U.S. system.\n\nMoreover, the idea that financial institutions can simply \"leave\" the U.S. market oversimplifies their relationship with American power. Major financial institutions are not just profit-maximizing entities but are deeply intertwined with U.S. geopolitical influence. They benefit from U.S. military and diplomatic power protecting global trade routes and enforcing property rights worldwide.\n\nThe experience of other financial centers supports this view. London maintained its position as a global financial hub despite higher tax rates than competing jurisdictions. What mattered more was its regulatory environment, institutional depth, and network effects.\n\nThis isn't to say that tax rates don't matter at all - they do. But treating them as the decisive factor ignores the complex web of advantages that make the U.S. financial system unique. The risk of capital flight is real but manageable, especially for modest tax increases that don't fundamentally alter the United States' competitive position.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​", "authorship": "human"}
{"Article Number": 316, "title": "CMV: Most of our problems with capitalism would be solved by the government entering the market. ", "article": "The main goal of all companies, especially if they're publicly traded, is to increase profits. This puts them in direct conflict with most consumers who are just trying to get their goods at a fair price.  The conflicting wants of companies and consumers means that capitalism is inherently hostile to the buyers as companies will do almost anything to extract more money from our pockets. \n\n  \nThis inherent hostility to the buyer is capitalism's greatest flaw. \n\n  \nSomeone could argue that a free market would fix this flaw as companies compete for every dollar, but the competition under capitalism is not real. Private companies are playing for the same team even if they're selling the same product. If Wal-Mart can convince people that groceries should be %20 more expensive then that's good for Target. In this case Target would have no incentive to compete with Wal-Mart on price, because if they just decide to raise prices together then the consumer will have no other options but to buy at the higher price. This same principle can be applied to every part of the economy. \n\n  \nBut this problem could be solved if the government just started company-like departments and brought a restraining force to the market. The United States Postal Service (USPS) is a good example. It's a service provided to citizens by the government in a manner that mimics a company. USPS keeps Fed-Ex, UPS, DHL, etc from getting crazy with their prices.  \n\n  \nWe all know that the price of everything has been surging since 2020, but this price surges did not happen in shipping. Why? It's because the USPS exists and would eat up their market share if the price gap between USPS and the private providers was too large. \n\n  \nProof: Fed-Ex Rates 2025 - [https://www.fedex.com/content/dam/fedex/us-united-states/services/FedEx\\_Standard\\_List\\_Rates\\_2025.pdf](https://www.fedex.com/content/dam/fedex/us-united-states/services/FedEx_Standard_List_Rates_2025.pdf)\n\nFed-Ex Rates 2022 - [http://web.archive.org/web/20220324124837/https://www.fedex.com/content/dam/fedex/us-united-states/services/FedEx\\_Standard\\_List\\_Rates\\_2022.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20220324124837/https://www.fedex.com/content/dam/fedex/us-united-states/services/FedEx_Standard_List_Rates_2022.pdf)\n\n  \nUPS Rates 2025 - [https://www.ups.com/us/en/support/shipping-support/shipping-costs-rates/flat-rate-shipping.page](https://www.ups.com/us/en/support/shipping-support/shipping-costs-rates/flat-rate-shipping.page)\n\n  \nUPS Rates 2022 - [http://web.archive.org/web/20211129032120/https://www.ups.com/us/en/support/shipping-support/shipping-costs-rates/flat-rate-shipping.page](http://web.archive.org/web/20211129032120/https://www.ups.com/us/en/support/shipping-support/shipping-costs-rates/flat-rate-shipping.page)\n\n  \nPrice of groceries since 2022: [https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1bar94s/prices\\_on\\_items\\_i\\_buy\\_increased\\_75\\_from\\_2022\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1bar94s/prices_on_items_i_buy_increased_75_from_2022_to/)\n\n  \nAlso in the area where the Tennessee Valley Authority, a government own electricity provider which operates like the USPS, the rates for electricity are lower than the national average. I think this is also due to private companies needing to compete with a provider that isn't solely motivated by profits. \n\n  \nIf we could insert a government owned alternative in every sector of the economy which operates like a business and competes in the market with the private companies, I believe that would solve the problem with capitalism and would keep prices in line.

Tiktok and shortform content have ruined my attention span, and I know it's done the same to lots of others. There's probably lots studies out there that support this, but it’s common logic really.\n2. **Cyberbullying/Lack of Empathy/and Toxic Comment Culture** This is by far the worst issue on this list. God forbid you see someone doing something cool or have a unique hobby. I shutter every time I open the damn comment section. There's so much passive aggressiveness and outright bullying, whether it’s about the video itself or something unrelated. It’s honestly becoming the new twitter. It wasn’t always like this. I’ve only really noticed this in the past year and a half. And its taken a pretty bad toll on my mental health, and it’s the reason I keep deleting the app. The negativity is overwhelming.\n3. **Decline of Meaningful Content (brainrot)** Memes and humor have always been a part of Tiktok, but in recent years, the content has become downright unfunny. What’s funny to me is how Tiktok users will make fun of kids on YT Shorts, even though Tiktok is just as bad, if not worse.\n4. **Constant Need for Validation** This is kind of related to the cyberbullying issue. Everyone on this side of Tiktok constantly seeks validation from others. It's all about conforming to what's \"normal\" and avoiding being seen as weird or different. One person will say something, and then everyone else watching that video will blindly agree.\n\nAt this point, this is turning into a rant, so here are 10 other points Chatgpt generated:\n\n* Decreased privacy and data security\n* Unrealistic beauty standards and body image issues\n* Influence of fake news and misinformation\n* Pressure to maintain a curated, perfect life\n* Addiction to social validation and numbers\n* Negative impact on sleep patterns and mental health\n* Reduced face-to-face social skills and human interaction\n* The rise of cancel culture and online mob mentality\n* Environmental impact of excessive digital consumption\n* Toxic competition and comparison with others\n\nSome of these issues may not be as big of issues as others, but they still matter.

And Florida is just boiling hot all year round so not any better\n\nFood: according to many sources West Coast has the best food in the country. The best Mexican, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Japanese is all on the west coast. I guess East Coast is more famous for Italian, but in all other ways the East Coast pales in comparison \n\nNature: West Coast has numerous mountains, lakes, deserts, even volcanoes. In comparison the East Coast is very bland. Yes we do have the Appalachian mountains but they are quite flat and not nearly as exciting as the Rockies or Cascades\n\nDiversity: West Coast is very ethnically diverse, while the East Coast is very homogenous outside a few major population centers \n\nRegional pride aside, it hurts me to say that the West Coast just seems better/more fun in every way. Would be happy if someone can change my view\n\n", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 330, "title": "CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists", "article": "A recent conversation with a Christian friend has me thinking about a common misunderstanding when it comes to belief, evidence, and the burden of proof. My friend told me that I can't claim \"God doesn't exist\" because I can't provide evidence to prove that God doesn't exist. This reasoning frustrated me because, in my view, it's not my job to prove that something doesn't exist—it’s the job of the person making the claim to provide evidence for their assertion.\n\nNow, I want to clarify: I'm not claiming that \"God does not exist.\" I'm simply rejecting the claim that God does exist because, in my experience, there hasn't been any compelling evidence provided. This is a subtle but important distinction, and it shifts the burden of proof.\n\nIn logical discourse and debate, the burden of proof always falls on the person making a claim. If someone asserts that something is true, they have the responsibility to demonstrate why it’s true. The other party, especially if they don’t believe the claim, is under no obligation to disprove it until evidence is presented that could support the original claim.\n\nThink of it like this: Suppose I tell you that there’s an invisible dragon living in my garage. The burden of proof is on *me* to demonstrate that this dragon exists—it's not your job to prove it doesn’t. You could remain skeptical and ask me for evidence, and if I fail to provide any, you would have every right to reject the claim. You might even say, \"I don't believe in the invisible dragon,\" and that would be a perfectly reasonable response.\n\nThe same applies to the existence of God. If someone says, “God exists,” the burden falls on them to provide evidence or reasons to justify that belief. If they fail to do so, it’s not unreasonable for others to withhold belief. The default position is in fact rejection afterall.\n\nIn the context of atheism, the majority of atheists don’t claim \"God does not exist\" in an assertive, absolute sense (although some do). Instead, atheism is often defined as the lack of belief in God or gods due to the absence of convincing evidence. This is a rejection of the assertion \"God exists,\" not a positive claim that \"God does not exist.\" In this way, atheism is not an assertion, but is rather a rejection, further removing the burden of proof from atheists. \"Life evolves via the process of natural selection\" or \"the Big Bang created the universe\" would be assertions that require further evidence, but rejecting the notion of God existing is not.\n\nIf someone says, \"There’s an invisible dragon in my garage,\" and I say, \"I don't believe in your invisible dragon,\" I'm not asserting that the dragon absolutely does not exist. I’m simply withholding belief until you can present compelling evidence. This is exactly how atheism works. I’m not claiming the nonexistence of God; I’m just rejecting the claim of His existence due to a lack of evidence.", "authorship": "human"}

That's right. The leading candidate for the DNC chair also happens to be from Minnesota where Ventura is from. He happens to have close ties to the DFL, especially with one of the major figures like Tim Walz, someone who got his record as a military vet baselessly attacked by MAGA republicans. This may have angered and pushed Ventura over the edge.  He considers Walz a friend and political ally,  despite his Independent affiliation and distaste for two party politics. \n\nI have a hunch, and I am calling it. Ventura is prepping to run as a Democrat in 2028 if Ken Martin wins DNC chair, thereby giving the Democrats their own version of a Trump like figure but this time someone who genuinely supports the average American and has his heart in the right place.  Despite some of Jesse's out there conspiracy theories, Ventura's track record as a governor suggests otherwise that he can both shake up politics and form concensus effectively by adopting a sane and steady yet bold approach to governance. \n\nI'm open to any insights with regard to my intuition and Ventura's viability as national candidate for the democrats under a possibly new DNC leadership that will mirror the DFL's more grassroots approach for campaigning.

Wouldn't that be special treatment to women and be... sexist?\n\nI don't want to believe all women blindly.

I am a sceptical person, cynical even, so I don't want to take a break from critical thinking skills just because it's an SA allegation. All crime is crime, and should ideally be treated under the same principle of 'innocent until guilty'.\n\nBut the majority of the online communities tend to disagree, and very strongly disagree. So, I'm probably missing something here.\n\n(I'm a woman too, and have experienced SA too, not that it changes much, but just an added context here)\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\n**Edit 1:**\n\n**TLDR: I'd consider my view changed, well kinda. The original thought seems well-meaning but it's just a terrible slogan, that's failed on multiple levels, been interpreted completely differently and needs to be retired.**\n\nThank you for taking the time to be patient with me, and explaining to me what the real thing is. This is such a nice community, full of reasonable people, from what I can see. (I'm new here).\n\nComments are saying that the original sentiment behind the slogan was - ***don't just dismiss women reporting crimes, hear them out -*** and I completely wholeheartedly support that sentiment, of course, who would not.\n\nThat's the least controversial take. I can't imagine anyone being against that.\n\nThat's not special treatment to any gender. So, that's definitely feminism. Just hear women out when they're reporting crimes, just like you hear out men. Simple and reasonable.\n\nAnd I wholeheartedly agree. Always have, always will.\n\n**Edit 2:**\n\nAs 100s of comments have pointed out, the original slogan is apparently - **'believe women'**. I have heard \"Believe all women\" a lot more personally... That doesn't change much any way, it's still sexist.\n\nIf a lot of the commenters are right... this started out as a well-meaning slogan and has now morphed into something that's no longer recognizable to the originally intended message...\n\nSo, apparently it used to mean \"don't dismiss women's stories\" but has been widely misinterpreted as \"questioning SA victims is offensive and triggering, and just believe everything women say with no questions asked\"? That's a wild leap!\n\n**Edit 3:**\n\nI think it's just a terrible slogan. If it can be seen as two dramatically different things, it's failing. Also -\n\n\\- There are male SA survivors too, do we not believe them?  \n\\- There are female rapists too, do we believe the woman and ignore the victim if they're male?  \n\\- What if both the rapist and the victim are women, which woman do we believe in that case?\n\nIt's a terrible slogan, plain and simple.\n\n*Why they didn't just use the words \"Don't dismiss rape victims\" or something if that's what they wanted to say. Words are supposed to mean things. \"Believe women\" doesn't mean or imply \"the intended message of the slogan\". What a massive F of a slogan.*\n\nI like **\"Trust but verify\"** a lot better. I suggest the council retire \"Believe women\" and use \"Trust, but verify.\"\n\n**Edit 4:**\n\nAdded clarification:\n\nI'll tell you the sentiment I have seen a lot of, the one that made me post this, and the one I am still against...\n\nIf a woman goes public on social media with their SA story... and another person (with no malicious intent or anything) says *\"the details aren't quite adding up\"* or something like *\"I wonder how this could happen, the story doesn't make sense to me.\"*\n\n... just that is seen as triggering, offensive, victim-blaming, etc. ([Random example I just saw a few minutes ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoWeKnowThemPodcast/comments/1hjbgrf/comment/m36s6uj/)) I have heard a lot of words being thrown around. Like \"*How dare you question the victim?\" \"You're not a girl's girl, if you don't believe, we should believe all women.\"*\n\nIt feels very limiting and counter-productive to the larger movement, honestly.

A neuronal network (most common machine learning models on generative AI) is a series of well designed linear transformations and activation functions that using brute force can 'learn' (which means they find a 'good enough' probability distribution) how to not make an error, what's an error? It depends, people define what an error is. \n\nAI can't do shit on its own, it's a math function that takes numbers and return numbers.

I will admit that despite the past decades' major downsides, they are viewed much more favorably based on various statements, regardless of the age group – from the amount of analysis I had conducted in my research, it is immensely rare to hear about how decades such as the 1980s and the 1990s are viewed negatively in the same vein as the 2020s; the disdain for the latter couldn't be more overstated as I had underwent personal struggles with anxiety and depression from recent current events. Even when I struggled from my mental disability in my childhood, I still viewed the past rather fondly. Granted, there is a theoretical chance that I could be just viewing the past with 'rose-tinted glasses', I find it to be practically impossible to imagine the 2020s to be viewed so fondly in retrospects given the overly negative reception with many past events in comparison.\n\nSo far, the 2020s decade has given people the pandemic and its after-effects within society, political unrest along with radical polarization, increased social isolation leading to depression and increased risks of suicide, the gradual erosion of democracy with cases such as Afghanistan and Myanmar, inflation along with massive corporate consolidation over housing, multiple genocides and wars, the countless mass shootings happening within the United States, skyrocketing cost of living, the increasing gap of wealth gap inequality, erosion of certain rights such as abortion, greenhouse gas emissions have increased global average temperatures, and that’s only to list a few. I understand that horrible events in the past have happened as well - it's just that so much bad has happened from this decade alone that it seems to make the events of the past pale in comparison.  I just find that the world, let alone this decade, is seemingly bleak and will not be looked back at admirably with the exception of the young adolescents and individuals that have been raised in a high class privileged lifestyle.\n\nIdeally, there is testimony from research groups backed up by data that society as a whole is supposedly better off than before from the decrease of extreme poverty, fewer people dying in conflicts in recent decades than in most of the 20th century, the ever-advancing medical treatments against fatal illnesses, increased life expectancy along with decreased child mortality rate; those aspects are taken for granted admittedly. However, the general vibe that I have felt recently is anything but positive – I noticed that people are generally depressed overall due to various factors that have been listed. I read that the same group of adults aged 18-35 in general will note that their time in certain past decades that they lived in at that time positively whereas another group of adults within the same age bracket will persistently state that the 2020s is a terrible time to be living in. Even from reading about older generations that have lived through certain rough times with the Great Depression, the World Wars, the looming threat of the Cold War, segregation, apartheid, communism with Eastern Europe, the Vietnam War, the AIDS epidemic that those periods of time, they would state that this time of era is even worse than they they lived through which really puts the 2020s in such a negative light.\n\nTo put it in layman's terms, I am filled with confidence that the 2020s is generally despised now and that it will never be - this decade's overall vibe and reception will be no different than the 1930s.

{"Article Number": 340, "title": "CMV: Men are more a threat to women than the other way around\n ", "article": "Throughout history, gender dynamics have showed us an imbalance in the way harm is inflicted between men and women. I am fully aware both men and women are capable of wrongdoing and committing the most outrageous crime possible.\n\nHowever, statistics, societal structures and behavioral tendencies show that men are more likely to pose a threat to women than the reverse. When we analyze any crime statistics, it becomes very obvious that men commit the majority of violent crimes worldwide. I do not have any specific data or sources to strengthen my statement, but I am sure you can find many of them online\n\nWhen it comes to domestic violence women are overwhelmingly the victims. I know men can also be victims of domestic violence. There are many ways women can also abuse men be it psychologically, emotionally and sometimes this can lead men to have a hard life. Abusive people no matter the gender should face consequences and victims (be it men or women) must be heard and get help. But my point falls under the fact that when it comes to men-women interaction women are more likely to be harmed by men. Sexual assaults are predominantly committed by men. For example, if a woman is walking alone at night, her primary concern is often the possibility of being attacked by an individual and this individual is likely to be man. The fear is grounded in reality, as men are physically stronger than women and then can easily have the upper hand over women when it comes to physical assaults and violence. And please do not tell me that there exist women who can also assault men. I know there are always the exception to the rules, but this does not make it general\n\nEven men are afraid of other men in many situations. When we sleep at homes, it is likely that robbers who trespassed at our houses are men. So as a man I am more likely to be confronted to another male burglar. As a man, I would also fear for my life and the safety of my family during wartime, knowing that soldiers or aggressors primarily men could attack, conscript, or kill me. So, imagine how much fear would the woman feel since women are mostly easy targets. Of course, men can also be targets as well but and if you agree with this statement then this means you approve that men are the ones that pose more threat to both genders  \n\nI will clarify that not all men are like that. While there are men who are a threat to other, there are many on the other side who are protector, good guys who fight against bad men. However, the behaviors of a subset of men are enough to create widespread fear and distrust among women. I've been discussing this matter with a lot of people, and many agree with me while others said I am overexaggerating and being paranoiac.\n\nChange my point of view\n\n  \nEdit: Thank all of you for your replies. Many comments were interesting and instructive, and this changed a bit my perspective of how I viewed the different type of existing violence. Some comments said my post was just about stating an obvious fact in today's society. I think I was misunderstood. My post was not about which gender causes more harm to the other since you can find may statistics on that but rather how do women and men feel with each other and how do the share of violence committed by men and women shape how we behave instinctively in our different interaction. As a woman you may fear to go late in the night because you can easily be targeted by a stalker, robber that will have the upper hand due to the difference in physical strength. Men also can feel the same toward other men and It is understandable. There are many real-life examples to illustrate this. So, my point is more about the feeling women have when interacting with men. In my thought process I considered physical violence as a direct effect that shape our instinct response to certain situations Some comments pointed the existence of non-physical violence, and it is completely true that nonphysical violence is as much negatively impactful as physical violence. A comment mentioned that nonphysical violence are more passive, subversive, and subtle while physical violence is more direct, visible which is why we have different instinct responses about them because of their different nature.

{"Article Number": 344, "title": "CMV: There's only 3 actual reasons people voted for, and continue to support, Donald Trump", "article": "So, after talking with conservatives over the years and reading posts from conservatives either here on Reddit or other social media platforms, I've come to believe there is only 3 real reasons people voted for and have supported Donald Trump. \n\n**1. They want to go back to 2019.** I think this is what they mean when they talk about the economy and prices. They just literally want to go back to before the pandemic, because the pandemic fucked up a lot of things. Lots of things never went back to normal, like businesses no longer being 24 hours, people's behavior in public, kid's behavior in schools, and, of course, the price of groceries and gas. You can show them evidence and stats and graphs and articles all day long at how well we we've been doing under Biden, but the damage has been done. The pandemic hurt industries world wide and caused inflation world wide, and they saw the price of eggs go up under Biden so that's who they're going to blame. Not the pandemic.\n\nHad there not been a global pandemic, maybe things wouldn't have gotten so expensive and there wouldn't have been any logistical issues globally when it came to shipping goods. Millions of people would still be alive today. But things are the way they are now because it happened. They think Donald Trump is going to pile us all into a time machine and take us back to that pre-pandemic world, and that's why they voted for him. \n\n**2. They don't really like Trump that much. They just hate liberals that much.** A lot of the stuff MAGA does and says is performative and meant to piss off liberals. They didn't wear diapers, carry around JD Vance \"jizz\" in a cup, and buy stupid looking sneakers for themselves or for their love of Trump. They did it because they wanted to rile up the libs. They literally just want to enrage liberals because it makes them feel in control and powerful. If they've gotten you upset, then in their mind they have won.\n\nThe inflammatory things MAGA people or far-right people post online--all the sexist, misogynistic, and racist stuff--is meant to get engagement, because engagement equals money. They know if they post a pic of themselves in a golden diaper with a caption that says. \"REAL MEN WEAR DIAPERZZZ !!!\" they will get a response. And they do not care if that response is negative. They're getting attention, money, and they're pissing off the people they hate the most. Donald Trump just happens to be a tool they can use to say the inflammatory things that they do, and I honestly think Trump realizes this and that's why he sells all that stupid merch. He knows they'll buy it, and that they're only buying it to \"own the libs.\" They proudly wear those hats in the same way a few years ago 2A people under Obama were open carrying AR-15s in Wal-Mart and Dairy Queen. They *want* you to confront them, so they can fight with you. And in some cases, actually hurt you. \n\nSome conservative white women on TikTok came up with the idea that liberal women want to physically attack them for voting for Donald Trump. They literally made it up, but they make up this stupid shit because they want to fight and \"win.\" And right now, Trump is a really easy thing for them to provoke a fight over. \n\nSo, it has nothing to do with Trump himself really. It's what they can use him for. They know he's a shady creep, but they'd so much rather worship the shady creep than agree with a liberal that transwomen should be able to pee in the women's restroom. They might even secretly agree, but they'd burn in hell before they'd admit it. And they know worshiping--or pretending to worship--the shady creep will get their posts shared, saved, and commented on in the thousands. Then they proudly go to the polls and cast their vote for Trump because somewhere a \"demonrat\" will cry and melt into a rainbow puddle. \n\n**3. Guns and babies.** This is mostly the reasoning for those Classic Republicans that have been around since Reagan. In my experience, even when I've gotten a Republican to agree that two consenting adults should be able to get married even if they are two men or two women, and that yes, our for-profit healthcare system doesn't work and universal might be better, and that yes, the public schools shouldn't be teaching the Bible, they always pump the brakes when it comes to guns and abortion. \n\nIf it's one thing the Republican party has been good at, it's been making up imaginary problems and convincing millions of people these imaginary problems supersede all others. They've successfully gotten their voters to believe that a vote for a Democrat equals federal agents at your door the next day to collect all your guns. Trump used that at the debate and Kamala called him out on it. I heard Hillary was going to take our guns. I heard Obama would. I heard Kerry would. I don't really remember it, but I'm sure people were saying Gore and Clinton would do it too. They've been at this for decades. \n\nLikewise, a vote for a Democrat means women in their 8th month of pregnancy can go to an abortion doctor and be like \"i'd like one abortion, please!\" and the doc will say, \"okay sure!\" Then they both kill a perfectly healthy, live baby and do some kind of satanic ritual afterwards.\n\n(Okay, that last part might be exaggerated a little, but I don't think I'm *that* far off.) \n\nThe GOP has done a damn good job with using these two issues to keep people voting for them. And I personally know people who went to the polls in 2016, 2020, and this year and held their nose as they voted for Trump just because of those two things.\n\nMillions of people are okay with staying poor and sick, as long as their guns will be safe and babies won't die, and that's why they voted for him.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nSo, those are the three actual reasons that I think are why people voted for Trump and support him. \n\nPlease change my view.", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 352, "title": "CMV: significant aspects of the Big Bang Theory are faith based.", "article": "The Big Bang Theory (BBT) makes the claim that the universe was a single sense point of matter which rapidly expanded to create space and time, and it's still expanding today. \n\nHow did scientists come to these conclusions? They measure observable matter and radiation shifts in the universe and see that all matter is accelerating away from each other.\n\nI've heard this described before like the universe is a balloon and we are a point on that balloon. As the balloon inflates, we are moving away from all other points on the expanding surface, and other points are also moving away from each other. I don't know if this is a perfect analogy, but it makes sense to me.\n\nSo were the universe and time created with the Big Bang? Let's start with the universe. The definition seems to be a bit obscure, so I will give it the most charitable interpretation. All observable matter, or all that are part of the current system we are in would make up the universe. The BBT seems to present compelling, science based evidence, that this system we call the universe was created from a singularity billions of years ago. This is not where I take issue. \n\nI take issue with the claim that time and space were created. Let's start with space. Essentially space is just everything, including empty vacuums. If the universe is expanding, then whatever is beyond the universe is just space waiting to be filled in. Space is infinite. When there was a singularity, empty space was still there beyond the singularity. That's my belief anyway. \n\nSo how has the BBT proven that it was created? They haven't, and they can't. Scientists seem to have a general agreement (though not all do) and it gets taught to students like it's science. Where is the evidence? Without evidence, it's just faith or philosophy.\n\nAll they have proven is that the measurable space between known matter has been created. Without matter we cannot measure space because we have no reference point. Just because we can't measure it with our limited capabilities doesn't mean it doesn't exist. \n\nAnd does it even make logical sense it wouldn't exist? That there would be some edge of matter and beyond is something *less* than empty space, incapable of being filled with matter? Then how is the universe expanding into it? And if the universe is expanding into it, then it must have existed before the Big Bang. \n\nTime is a very similar argument. Time (as I believe it) is just a single dimensional measurement stretching forward and backwards to infinity. If the singularity existed, then it just have existed at a point in time. That's how they can even estimate how *long ago* it existed.\n\nIt seems they believe time is a ray rather than a line and the singularity was the endpoint of the ray, existing in a timeless state. Again, where is the evidence of this? All we're observing is expansion. If time truly didn't exist in the singularity, we couldn't measure it to even know. It's just faith.\n\nSo why are scientists teaching this like it's science, but not faith? I understand they don't say the BBT is the definitive truth, that there are other theories and it's not fully proven, but they still claim it as the overwhelming consensus among scientists. They should leave out the faith and stick to science and what was actually proven, or at least be more transparent that that just made up some of their conclusions whole cloth with absolutely **zero** evidence pointing towards them.\n\nEdit - if you are trying to prove the Big Bang happened, please read what I'm saying. I specifically said there's evidence the Big Bang happened, but there's no evidence that it created space and time. If you want a delta, do one of the following:\n\nShow where there is ANY evidence of the origin of space and time, meaning proof it didn't exist before the Big Bang. That is probably impossible, but you certainly will earn one if you can. This is the reason I made the post. Or..\n\nThe other way would be to demonstrate that I am wrong about the BBT claiming space and time were created during the Big Bang. I've seen numerous sources of information making this claim as well as learned this at University. Maybe my exposure is with scientific hacks, so show me that most are not making this claim.", "authorship": "human"}

By basic economics 101, betting markets are informationally efficient, so that means the rational best opinion is both sides are indeed equally likely to win\n\nThe judges gave it to Usyk.

Both, I think are true. I will award points if either position is disproved.\n\nESSENTIALLY YOU CAN HAVE BOTH OR YOU CAN'T HAVE EITHER.\n\nWhat must be true for abortion to be permissible:\n\nSome believe that a fetus is just a \"clump of cells\" and is akin to an object, this aids my argument and is the easy case.... However, at minimum, a fetus is such a thing that has low enough moral value to be permissible to be destroyed for the sake of destroying it (abortion). It's value is low enough that we can stop it's potential life even if they would have wanted to live it or found it worth living had they not been aborted. It's moral value is lower than an animal's because we don't find it permissible to kill a dog simply to end its life (we need the reason of, \"for the sake of food\" or \"for the sake of producing some object\" to make it permissible), however, we have assumed it is permissible to have an abortion whose only objective is to kill the fetus. Ergo, a fetus either has very, very, very low moral value, or it is an object and has no inherent moral value at all.\n\nOkay, so it is permissible for me to destroy the thing, why can't I modify it? Destroying something is a specific type of modification after all! By all means modifying a table is \"better\" than destroying it since it can still be used, however, since it is an object it carries no moral weight at all and both are equal morally speaking.... I have to use the modified object in an immoral way first (or already have an immoral motivation which is driving the modification)! If I were to \"modify\" a dog by cutting off it's leg this is certainly \"better\" than killing it. Likewise, we have already genetically modified animals for the sake of science all the time. Fish, for example, have even been genetically modified to be more aesthetically pleasing for pet owners. Ergo, since a fetus has lower moral value than an animal, it ought be permissible to genetically modify it on these grounds alone.\n\nComparatively, doing a genetic modification and letting the fetus come to term might generate more net-pleasure than destroying the fetus. Many people who have genetic disorders (a possible consequence) still live very meaningful lives and even in cases of extreme pain prefer to have lived their life than not. Additionally, people of harsh life circumstance also would prefer their existence to non-existence. Furthermore, if the genetic modification ends up being beneficial then this will certainly be way, way better than have never existing in the first place. Ergo, since there is a very high probability that the genetically modified fetus would prefer existence over non existence we generate an increase in net pleasure.\n\nThere is no moral duty to protect the fetus, ergo I can with it what I will...

And then, they went on to lose the civil war, so, ya, they're going to have some racist residuals, at least.  (being charitable here)  This whole thing seems really unfortunate since it leads to more division in our country over religion than necessary.  We have 2 big problematic churches, (plus a few that branched from them), and those are the SBC and the Mormons.  So let's be precise about that and not paint with an over broad brush.\n\nIt's for the above reasons that \"White Evangelical\" seems like a destructive term which should be retired and replaced with \"Fundamentalist\" which is far more descriptive and not overbroad.\n\nEdit: \n\nAs a result of some discussion, I would retract the objection to the \"white\" portion of the label since it does seem important for many contexts.  I maintain that Evangelical is a bad term and that Fundamentalist is better.\n\n", "authorship": "human"}

He was appointed to investigate Trump and file charges if his investigation yielded criminal evidence. That is exactly what he did. The fact that the indictments were doomed once Trump was elected is irrelevant. The facts in his indictments do not go away. Voluntarily dismissing the charges is a dereliction of his duty to prosecute based on those facts. \n\nWaiting for Trump to take office and have them dismissed himself is important for the historical record. Because the indictments were dismissed voluntarily, Trump gets to enjoy the rhetorical advantage of saying that they were never valid in the first place. That is not something Smith should have allowed. He should have forced the President to order his attorney general to drop the charges. Then at least the historical record would show that the charges were not dismissed for lack of merit, but because Trump was granted the power to dismiss them. \n\nSmith was charged with dispensing justice, but refused to go down with the ship. The only reasons I could think for this decision is fear of retaliatory action from Trump, or unwillingness to waste taxpayer dollars. I will not dignify the ladder with a response. This indictment is a fraction of the federal budget. And as for fearing retaliatory action... yeah, it's a valid fear with Trump, but that does not give you an excuse to discharge your duties.

As such, I am likely to misunderstand or take a simplistic view of American culture and social feelings. I also come from a country that has universal healthcare, so the debate around private health insurance already feels outdated to me.\n\nI give the above as reasons my view may be incorrect.\n\nSo as the title suggests, I think no substantial change will come about as a result of the sudden and renewed focus on the awful business practices of the American health insurance sector.\n\nThe murder of the CEO has had what I see as bipartisan applause from the American people. Abuse by the insurance industry does not consider the political leaning of a person. Despite this, I see no significant (i.e. real world, offline) attempt from the American people to turn this into a movement that could result in real political pressure. I don't mean more killing, I mean large scale protesting, marches, boycott, picketting, etc. Even rioting would make sense.\n\nOver the past years, I have seen a number of significant events causing major unrest in the US.\n\nDuring COVID, Americans were rapidly out in the streets protesting lockdowns, mask and vaccine mandates. This was a large scale country wide event.\nI have seen no widespread mass protests focusing on the healthcare industry.\n\nThe election of Biden in 2020 sparked the Jan 6 riot. This was a select group of partisan political loyalists, who undertook extreme but focused action.\nI have seen no evidence of small groups or even individuals taking further extreme action on the healthcare industry. \n\nThe killing of George Floyd sparked massive BLM protests/riots. Floyd's death was a single event, but part of a wider social injustice of police racial discrimination.\n\nIt is this last example that I think directly compares to this current situation. A single profound event that speaks to wider injustices.\nFor decades the American people have been under the heel of health insurers. It seems everyone either has been denied care or knows someone who has. Your political system protects and enriches this industry. \n\nThis issue seems to affect everyone, yet as soon as the CEO assassination occured and especially once the motives where clearly as suspected, there has been endless verbal and written support, but not any major physical action from the people to demand the change you all desire.\n\nBasically, if real action hasn't started already, I don't see it starting later.

{"Article Number": 360, "title": "CMV: No \"Flat Earth\" model is compatible with observable patterns in how the sun moves", "article": "I think it's obvious that \"flat Earth\" theory is wrong.  This CMV takes a stronger position than just saying it's wrong.  Not only is flat Earth theory wrong, it's wrong in a way that you can observe on your own without having to trust scientists.\n\nThe most common version of a flat earth model I see is one where [the Earth is a disc with the north pole being the middle of the disc and the south pole being a large ring around the outside of the disc](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Flat_earth.png).  And then the sun is some kind of light source above the disc moving around the [sun](https://stock.adobe.com/video/flat-earth-3d-model-day-and-night-animation-geocentric-concept-of-universe-side-angle-view-topographic-map-without-clouds-layer-ancient-beliefs-4k/229715274) being some kind of light source moving around above the disc.  I'm going to be referring to this idea when I talk about a \"flat Earth\" just for succinctness, but I think everything I'm saying would apply to any flat Earth model that doesn't have some additional exotic assumptions to get around it.\n\nThe reason I'm saying we can reject flat Earth as a possibility has to do with just observing how the sun move across the sky.  It just doesn't move in a way that's consistent with a light that's above you moving around a disc.  Look at the [model](https://stock.adobe.com/video/flat-earth-3d-model-day-and-night-animation-geocentric-concept-of-universe-side-angle-view-topographic-map-without-clouds-layer-ancient-beliefs-4k/229715274) linked above.  If you pause it when the sun is over (for example) Australia, it only shows Australia being illuminated, but really there's no reason people in South America couldn't see the sun at that point.  There's nothing blocking them from being able to see it.  Maybe it would be further away and not as bright, but it wouldn't be blocked by the horizon.\n\nOkay, maybe you're thinking that this animation is a bit wrong and the sun is actually smaller and lower to the ground; this would mean that it is hard or impossible to see from a great distance.  And this is true, but it still wouldn't be consistent with what we see during a sunset.  A small but close-to-the-Earth sun moving across a flat Earth would get smaller and smaller as it moves away from you and goes off into the distance to illuminate a different part of the world.  This is inconstant with [what happens during sunsets](https://i.imgur.com/eKFwZxy.jpeg) though.  We observe a circle in the sky moving down towards the horizon, not getting smaller, and disappearing below the horizon.  Which, if you imagine a light just moving far away from you across a flat plane and not getting any lower, looks completely different.\n\nOkay, so maybe you're thinking that the sun does set.  After all, the flat Earth has an edge.  The sun can go below that and just pop up the other side the next day.  Sure, but if all of the Earth as we know it is on one side of that flat disc, then that means all of the Earth would experience day at the same time.  This of course, doesn't happen.  And you just need to set up contact with someone on another continent and send a few e-mails to realize that they can experience night while you are experiencing day and vice versa.\n\nSo there you go.  The way the sun moves during sunrise and sunset, and the fact that not every part of the planet experiences day at the same time, is enough to disprove flat Earth theory.  And these are two things that any person can easily observe for themselves.  Even if you believe that every scientist is trying to dupe you and you want to \"do your own research,\" you can very easily do your own research to see that the idea of a flat Earth is false.\n\nChange my view.", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 362, "title": "CMV: Having kids earlier is better than late*", "article": "*assuming an average life with at least some family and friends present.\n\nBirth rates and fertility rates are declining in the developed world and this is a hot topic both here and in bigger media. There are a lot of theories as to why and how to fix it. My view is that we should encourage and enable people to have kids earlier. Biologically the best time to have kids is between late teens and late twenties when fertility and hormone production is highest. With age men’s sperm are fewer, less motile and likelier to have epigenetic mutations. Women lose eggs overtime and with higher age are more likely to have chromosomal abnormalities.\n\nWith age also comes disease like cancer, diabetes, obesity, PCOS and STDs, age is also a factor on its own. Not to mention accidents.\n\nPicture these two scenarios\nWhen I was born my parents were 38, so when I was a kid they were in his 40s and said they never had energy to go play or do stuff together, literal quote is “we’re too old and tired”, so when I was a teenager they were in their 50s and it was even more of the same. I never really started to get to know them until I was an adult and found out they’re actually great people.\n\nNow the other scenario is having a kid when you’re 18, let’s say your parents did the same and they are now 36 and well able to provide assistance with child care or entertainment in evenings and weekends. The kid grows up when you’re in your twenties and have youth and energy to do things with your kids and create fun memories and when they become teenagers you’ll be entering 30s and can focus more on work while teenagers can be more independent. In turn you’ll be more likely to be healthy enough to spend time with youyour kids and grandkids in your forties. \n\nSomething like that but that’s how I think it’s also better from a parenting perspective.\n\nNow of course people are gonna say it’s too expensive and you need to focus on school in you’re twenties and while that’s true depending on where in the world you are, having a baby is not expensive but having kids and teenagers is. Therefore governments should make it much easier for people to have kids early. For example where I live all healthcare from conception until 18 years is free, you receive 12 months maternity leave and after that you can put your kid into a subsidised pre school from 1-5 year old, then schools are free until age 16, the city subsidises extra curriculars. The university here runs a daycare and parents get priority for student housing. We also receive about 3.600$ per year as child benefits per child. \n\nI think the only reason not to is that you may have not found the “right” person but that’s wishful thinking.\n\nCMV\n\nEdit: wow this got a lot of attention but so far no one changes my view that having kids earlier is better than late. But my view was changed because so many of you are cynical and actually think having kids is gonna put you in a wheelchair.

Everyone in the comments was encouraging her to not resort to violence, to let the police handle it, etc. And the more I read posts and articles like these, where someone suffers a horrible injustice because of another person, the response is always the same:\n\n\"Let the police handle it!\" \n\"Living a full life is the best revenge!\"\n\"Turn the other cheek and be the bigger person!\"\n\nBullshit.\n\nIn exceptionally horrible situations like these, I think it is 100% justified (and should be encouraged) to harm someone to the brink of death.

Therapy cannot fix everything. Neither can prison. Sometimes, seeking bloody retribution for significant injustices done to you or your family makes perfect sense. We can't just always let others handle our problems for us.

That is a completely evil person who may have ruined a child's life. That person should suffer as much as her son did, if not more. Am i morally wrong for thinking a child molester should be severely harmed for it?

It has destroyed peoples and cultures, creating large atrocities. \n\nHowever, I would argue that colonization as it is understood today, is just a misapplied version of the colonialism practiced in Antiquity. The Ancient Greeks were the first people along with the Phoenicians to practice settlement overseas, but it was the Romans who perfected it. \n\nSure, the Roman Empire had its imperfections, it was very militaristic, and conquered many peoples. However, this type of colonialism was the least harmful. Every time the Romans conquered a place, after the tensions wore off, the conquered were integrated into Roman society. Roman civilization and its benefits were spread through the Mediterranean, and the conquered peoples benefitted. Even the Jews, although I will admit Roman Jewish relations could have gone better. \n\nAnother example is the Mongol Empire. Although Genghis Khan conquered many, and killed large amounts of people, he was religiously tolerant, and the Mongol Empire was quite peaceful. \n\nThe true tragedy of the modern world is that the examples led and set by the Roman and Mongol Empires were not followed. \n\nIt is okay to be a war mongering nation and expanding empire as long as you eventually integrate the conquered peoples.

The thing is, arranged marriages are often inherently predatory, and they can be wrong from the start. These marriages are usually based on societal or family pressure rather than personal choice, so they're not built on genuine love or mutual respect. In situations like this, it only makes sense that both the husband and wife should be able to see other people or even cheat if they want to. It’s not about disrespecting the other person, but rather recognizing that the relationship was never really a fair or healthy foundation to begin with.\n\nThis isn't just about one side either—if you're from a culture that practices arranged marriages, it should apply to both the husband and the wife. Both parties deserve the freedom to explore other relationships if they're unhappy or unfulfilled in their marriage.\n\nNow, I get it, if they have kids, it can complicate things a bit. The kids might be confused or even traumatized by seeing one parent with someone else. But as they grow older, they'll likely understand that the parents' relationship was always flawed and that the affair wasn’t about breaking anything that was genuinely good.

Reportedly, this merger even has Japanese government's push written all over it, as they tried to keep Japanese Big Auto afloat ahead from competition from the Chinese, especially in the EV sector.\n\nHowever, I do not see this merger should or will happen:\n\n- On the \"will\" side: **Antitrust. This is a major factor.** Although Japanese regulators may be pushed to allow it, the scale of this merger will probably require foreign antitrust dogwatching similar to Microsoft-ActiBlizz or Korean Air-Asiana, which will end up with a long and stalled process, assuming it goes at all. This is also given because Mitsubishi has an alliance with Nissan at the moment and they will be dragged into the Honda merger.\n- On the \"should\" side (the rest of this bullet point): **Limited technological benefit.** What does Honda want from or trickle down to Nissan, beyond EV battery technology? People on American-centric car subs think this could be an entry point for RWD and ladder frame SUV/truck segments that Nissan have and Honda does not, but I do not believe Honda is interested in those. (Honda has not made an ICE rear-wheel production drive car since the S2000 was discontinued, barring the FIA GT3/Super GT race cars and the kei cars, such as the S660, as well as the Honda e EV. And though the Ridgeline exists, it's built on an unibody platform and I believe Honda is content with that; their other only pickup truck is the kei-sized Acty for Japan.) There is also the factor that Honda's reliability could go worse as it inherits the bad reliability things Nissan suffers right now.\n- **Management after-effects.** If Honda management takes over Nissan, it would make the Nissan side as like the Chrysler portion of both DaimlerChrysler (Daimler/Mercedes-Benz) and Stellantis (PSA), which would strip the good, unique parts of Nissan. (Though it might get rid of their unreliable CVT transmission for instance, a Honda-engined Nissan car is likely to piss off purists.) If Nissan side management takes over (though unlikely), it would make the Nissan side as like the McDonnell-Douglas portion of the Boeing merger, which has resulted in Boeing constantly fumbling.\n\n---\n\nThis leaves the only options for Nissan being a 2009 GM-style bailout of Nissan by the Japanese government (which may have political consequences, considering recent shakeups in the Japanese Diet), or at worst, shutting down and liquidating Nissan as a company, erasing themselves from both the car market and history books. Europe (Renault) failed at running Nissan, the U.S. Big Three probably don't care, and the Japanese government will fight tooth and nail to prevent the Chinese to take over Nissan [(ironically, Nissan also had closed a factory in China this year).](https://www.just-auto.com/news/nissan-closes-china-plant/)", "authorship": "human"}

Naturally people will blame the media for doing this but I don't think the media is to blame for this phenomenon. I simply think the problem lies with the people who watch the movie and then decide to glorify or admire a clearly bad character.\n\n Watching documentary about serial killers, most of them show case the horrible aspects of the serial killer, they never attempted to glorify the villains. I certainly never felt they were glorified or made to be admired. But there are a subset of people who get the wrong message and end up prasing these villains. \n\nThe common argument here is that \"they shouldn't cast an attractive actor to play the villain or serial killer\" but ask yourself why must the villain be physically ugly in order to be repulsive to the audience? Is the actions of these villains not enough to make them ugly? Why do attractive villains get a free pass to be horrible but not ugly villains?\n\nIt also plays into the stereotypes that villains are simply physically ugly people and only ugly people are villains. Which is certainly not true. The appearance of someone doesn't make them ugly, their actions make them ugly and i believe that's what most of the creators of these movies and shows were going for. So I don't blame them for how the fans reacted.  And this also extends towards fictional villains and the most solid example of why we shouldn't blame the creators to how fans praise the villains, is homelander from the boys.\n\nThe creators of the boys show never glorified homelander, if anything they did everything in their power to make the character as pathetic and disgusting as he can be. And yet homelander still have a fan base who glorify him. So much so that the actor for Homelander had to step up and say that the character he is playing is evil and not someone to be glorified.This isn't the first time it happened. The stalker from the show You, also had a fanbase and the actor himself had to come forward and state that this stalker is not someone to be attracted to, stalkers are not attractive.\n\nThis my take on the whole \"media glorified villains\" take.\n\nI might be missing something maybe part of the media is to be blamed but I'm not aware of it.

He was arraigned within a day or so as is standard practice in all criminal cases in NY.\n\nThen they said he's being charged with terrorism in order to chill further violence.  He's actually not being charged with terrorism per se, it's first degree murder, and he's being charged because that's what he did. He committed an act of violence meant to cause fear and bring about political change.\n\nThe rampant hypocrisy though is more maddening than the ignorance.  Redditors say the CEO is evil because he maximized corporate profits, as is essentially required by law, and in doing so, caused the deaths of people. Redditors say they don't fear violence or feel terrorized because Luigi's actions were directed against the rich who needlessly and selfishly live prosperously while others suffer and die.  On a global scale however, redditors are the rich living lavishly while allowing people to suffer and die.\n\nThe cost to save a life is around $4000. Most people who are sufficiently motivated are capable of working at a job where they can save $40,000 a year if they live frugally. Some don't have the ability or luck to do so, but there are plenty who can also save far more than that.  At the historic stock market return of 10.3%, that would be worth $46,000,000 in 45 years.

{"Article Number": 383, "title": "CMV: Personality types do more harm than good. ", "article": "There's a pretty broad spectrum of ways people have latched on to in order to categorize personality type. On one extreme you have the completely fanciful like Harry Potter houses and astrology signs. On the other you have psychologically replicatable personality diagnosis like Adhd and autism. And in the middle you have these things that are in some ways reflective of who you are but lack any rigor like the Meyers Briggs and the enneagram. \n\nWhile I imagine most on reddit would sneer at astrology signs and HP houses, my belief is that all of these are harmful. I think that they are so in two ways: \n\n1. They limit people's ability to understand people at a deep level.\n2. They distract from genuine forms of community building. \n\nOn the first point: people are inherently varried, complex, and interesting. You can spend years relatively close with someone before you start to really understand them. One might imagine that personality archetypes as a sort of tool to establish some base level understanding. A scaffold to construct a more complicated model. But in my experience this is rarely how it functions in practice. People who care about these things will use whatever personality categorization they like and stop further interest in the person. \n\n\"Oh you like books? That must be because you're a ravenclaw /intj/ autistic.\"\n\nInstead of inquiring further as to why the person likes books (is it escapism? A desire to appear smart?) The categorization is thought terminating. They've solved the other person. I think this occurs because people perceive these categories as reflecting some fundamental nature, rather than as social constructs. \n\nEven the more rigorously replicable categorizations have been arbitrarily constructed. When someone is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder or antisocial personality disorder, we tend to view those as some true property discovered within the person, rather than as useful labels that might aid in treatment. If we were to restart society we might end up with 2 different labels that have elements of each. \n\nI think this is bad for understanding others. What charitably presents itself as a tool tends to, in actuality, limit peoples understanding of eachother. \n\nSecond point being that these labels distract from genuine community building. We humans evolved to be in close knit tribes. To exist in cooperative communities where we love and care for one another. However, we've established a monolithic social order where people are atomized and cut off from one another. Neoliberal capitalism is perhaps the most efficient system at creating material wealth, but it has come at the cost of elliminating community. \n\nPersonality archetypes act as an alluring easy way to get that in the modern world. \"Here's a useful label to identify and connect with people like you.\" This taps into the instinctual desire to be a part of a group. Instead of being in an actual tribe, you're part of the hufflepuff tribe. You wear the colors and learn the lingo of that tribe just like you would in prehistoric times. \n\nI don't believe this is fulfilling though. Identifying some label foesnt fulfill the actual human-to-human connections that we need. When someone is diagnosed with adhd and they start to filter their feed for adhd memes and posts, they might get some momentary sense of \"oh, its nice to know that other people have had similar experiences to me.\" They may even use the language \"I am part of the adhd community.\" \n\nBut this isn't what generates human happiness. The label isn't fulfilling in the same way that bonding with someone person-to-person is. If these personality archetypes were being used as an excuse to form genuine communities in the same way people use religious identity as an excuse to connect with others (and religious people are happier than non religious people for this reason!) Then they might be a valuable tool, but in my experience and perception this isn't what happens. \n\nThough maybe I just don't perceive these communities because I don't belong to any like that.

{"Article Number": 384, "title": "CMV: \"Not All Men\" Completely Misses the Point", "article": "Edit: The people who got deltas did provide examples where \"not all men\" doesn't completely miss the point, but alas it is still a very unproductive response. It's like saying \"not all drivers\" to a mother whose son just got ran over and killed by a car. She's grieving, and all you can think to say is \"not all drivers\"? Seriously? That being said, I understand that there are women who really do hate all men. \n\nI'm a man. I can't even count the number of times that either I or someone else has stated a fact (say, that men commit the vast majority of violent crimes, especially those against women) and literally cited the FBI's crime statistics to point out why women should take precautions to stay safe, and so many men want come to the MEN'S rescue and say \"not all men\" as if that was ever the point of saying women need to be careful around men. As if the whole point of highlighting these issues is to just vilify all men.\n\nObviously when we're discussing women's safety, we're not talking about women attacking other women--my sister can actually hold her own against another woman, for example. But a man? She can't do anything there, she's toast. My sister is very physically fit and taller for a woman, but even a totally average man will be stronger and faster than her. That's why men will tell their girlfriends, wives, daughters, sisters, etc. to never walk alone at night, always carry a gun or taser, or some kind of weapon; it's to give the women an *advantage over men.* So I could easily turn it around on you: why would you even advise the women in your life this way, if it's not all men? It's not all men, so you shouldn't tell the women in your life to be careful around other men and take precautions. You shouldn't tell them to stay safe and never walk alone. You shouldn't say any of that to the women in your life, because it's not all men, right? So why are you pretending all men are monsters? Ohhh, that's right, because not all men are monsters and that's not what ANYONE is saying whenever they point out very REAL problems with men in this country (US).\n\nFurthermore, it's ridiculous to try and pretend women are referring to \"all men\" whenever they say \"men\". There are two relevant sexes here: men and women. Which one of the two is more of a physical threat to women? **Men.** So if someone says \"women need men to stop attacking/murdering/raping them,\" that is NOT an implication that \"all men\" do these things. It's an implication that there's a problem with men, specifically, (not women!) attacking, murdering, and raping women. It's another way of saying \"Men attack/murder/rape women far more often than other women do, and that's a problem\". Which is true! It's not saying \"all men do this,\" it's saying \"WAY more men than women do this, and that's a problem\". We need to get to the bottom of why that is and put a stop to it, that's what that statement means. It is not a statement to vilify each and every man that has ever lived, jesus christ. That's so self-victimizing and dramatic to pretend that's what's being said.\n\nIt's obviously not a biological issue. It's not simply because \"men have more testosterone than women\" because first of all, I've never once been physically violent for my entire life. Being a man (notably with pretty high testosterone myself) has never once made me want to do something like that. Also, if it was truly biological then we'd see the same level of disparity in gendered violence across the world, but we don't. In the US specifically, the disparity between the amount of violent crimes committed by men vs women is so vast. Obviously there are countries where it's even worse, but there are also many countries where it's significantly better. That, to me, proves that it's not a biological issue but a social issue. It's due to the male culture in this country, in some way, shape, or form. And that honestly doesn't surprise me when you listen to some of the lyrics of popular songs by male artists in the US and they're some of the most misogynistic, violent, sexist words I've ever heard. And then you have both teenage boys and grown ass men singing along, belting these lyrics and really loving them.\n\nI could use literally any analogy for this, because it's ridiculous. But I'll use this one: did you know that there are over 2,000 species of jellyfish in the world, and only about 70 of them can actually sting you? And many of those won't actually cause serious harm to humans even when they do sting you. There are a few (about 1%) that will notoriously cause serious harm to humans.

{"Article Number": 388, "title": "CMV: The Republican Party needs to dissolve and be replaced by a libertarian party", "article": "What I personally think would be best is to have a system where we keep the Democratic Party, but replace the Republican Party with a libertarian party. \nBut my reasons being that \n1. We need different political parties in order to keep one ideology from being the determining force. Sometimes the best solution is democrat, other times it’s libertarian. And even in the future something else.\n2. The Republican Party as it is today has gotten so corrupt. It is anything but small government like they claim. But the difference is a Republican government gets involved in the wrong issues. It’s basically setup in a dualistic elitist way to represent the supposed superior or good side and punish the supposed inferior or bad side.\n3. Exhibit 1: The billionaires. The whole assumption in republican ideology is that the wealthy deserve everything they earn. So they have a right to tax breaks. But the low and middle class don’t, since they didn’t supposedly work hard enough. And the very problem here is the assumption that the harder one works,  the more deserving they are. Which assumes hard work is in itself a virtue. Sure, hard work can be good, so long as it serves the common good. And if less work serves the common good, fine also. Much hard work goes against the common good, and many times is nothing more than trampling on others. Which leads eventually to corporate rule where the rich make the rules to cater to their interests.\n4. Exhibit 2: the religious fundamentalist. The whole premise of any form of fundamentalist is dualistic and elitist. In fact the whole Calvinist work ethic is partially responsible for catering to billionaires. However fundamentalism divides the world into the saved and damned. And the saved is a small number who fulfill a rigid criteria. Which is pretty much homophobic and anti lbgtq. Sure, people have a right to practice and hold fundie views. But it’s not the governments job to cater to those views. As history has shown, fundamentalist dualism has only lead to persecution of those they disagree with. Let’s see, crusades, Saudi Arabia, puritans. And today the millstone act, project 2025, and the anti-choice movement.\n5. Exhibit 3: the warhawks. I’ll say up front both dems and reps have had horrible foreign policy. But the Warhawk movement is dualistic and decides that nations they invade are the evil nations, and it becomes okay for them to bomb their countries. And who gets killed? Innocent civilians who did nothing but being on the warhawks hate list for whatever stupid reason. Let’s see, Vietnam, gulf war, and invasion of Iraq. Just to name a few. A libertarian side would favor non intervention to balance out democrats intervention so to keep civilians from getting killed.\n6. Exhibit 4: anti choice movement. Sure, it’s fine to believe life begins at conception. And if you don’t want to get an abortion, don’t. Heck you can even refuse to perform abortions. But the fundie assumption treats abortion as equal to murder is a personal view. And their ideology has only lead to government monitoring pregnancies, prosecution of miscarriages and putting women at risk in need of life saving treatment. Why? All because of extremist ideology.\n\nSolutions: 1) A libertarian system, the bias is towards less government intervention. The democrats are in favor of government intervention, usually to help someone in need. But government help can be good, but can also be problematic. Now republicans intervention is all about helping those they deem deserving and punishing those deemed evil. So that’s what we need. Two balancing political ideologies that are not about persecuting certain groups. 2) some form of Law and order are necessary which all political spectrums agree. But the libertarian law and order holds to principles of non-violence. So that would eliminate police activity in victimless crimes. Like the republicans favor on the war on drugs is a failure that only punishing non violent junkies. However the results are violent cartels and overfilled prisons. And why? Because the Republican Party sees drug users as evil and deserving of punishment. And then they support private prisons, since they see private prison operators as businessmen with good work ethic, and therefore worthy of making laws to keep prisons full. 3) There are all different ways libertarians and democrats can work together. Since matters like private property, capitalism vs Socialism, business regulations, social safety networks are matters that have a lot of grey area, and one answer may not work in every situation. \n\n", "authorship": "human"}

In addition, I am also quite certain due to personal experiences as well as sociological research I've read that the vast majority of both men and women (men more so) perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes.\n\nI know I'm late to the party, the term has really died down in usage, but after learning more about sexual objectification, I can't help but see parallels to so many of the behaviors that have caused women on social media to become disgusted with a (potential) male romantic partner.\n\nThe easy to grasp Wikipedia definition of the term is \"the act of treating a person solely as an object of sexual desire\", and icks look for me to be a consequence of seeing a man as a manifestation of an idealized sexual &amp; social role, seeing them functionally as an object or at least an entity that does not have the usual complexities of a human. In this case they are seen as a stoic protector &amp; competent provider, and sooner or later the observer experiences something that strongly clashes with that idea. Your new boyfriend swept you off your feet with his ripped figure, his charisma and his sexual technique, but then you saw him slip on bird shit, and now you can't see him anymore as the ideal of the unflappable protector. Same thing with so many other icks I've heard of:  \nHaving the hiccups, getting sick, using emojis, crying, admitting you've been intimate with other men, swimming with goggles, pushing a Pull door, stalling the car, etc etc  \nThat's not to say that anybody experiencing an ick is doing so because of sexual objectification, sometimes people just have vile personalities or non-existent hygienic standards, I 100% get that.\n\nMost of the viral icks boils down to the same thing though: You thought you had somebody who fit this widely-shared but impossible ideal, an object perfectly molded to your desires, but in the end you realize you have a real human being with a history, nuance and flaws in front of you. And since you have not had experiences that show you that that is not only okay but the normal view of a partner you gain once you spend enough time with them, you react with disgust or strong disappointment.", "authorship": "human"}

However, they've been consistently driven out of their fortified cities, with Avdivka and Torersk being some of the most notable instances of this. Ukrainian defense near Pokrovsk are currently struggling under the Russian offensive, and if Pokrovsk falls, Ukraine has no fortified position behind that for quite a distance, forcing them to either give up large chunks of land or defend open and unfortified ground.\n\nThe AFU is not in great shape either. Their premier units, like the 47th Mechanized, have been whittled down to a shell of their former selves as attrition takes a major toll on them. Their rank and file is not doing much better, as many of their units around Pokrovsk are at less than 40% strength according to Pravda UA: https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/articles/2024/09/17/7475408/#\n\nThe Russian military, meanwhile, has a formidable artillery advantage and has begun catching up to Ukraine in the quantity and quality of FPV drones they’ve been using. Incentivized by large cash bonuses and salaries, Russian volunteers are currently signing up in huge numbers, ensuring that addition does not decimate the Russian army. While the Russian economy is struggling, there is no indication that anybody in the Kremlin is considering ending the war due to the economy. Countries rarely end wars due to economic pressure in the first place. For example, both World Wars bankrupted the British Empire entirely, but they never surrendered until all of their objectives had been achieved. In fact, among Russia’s political elite, the main complaint has been that Putin has not mobilized the economy and populace more. If you remember the Wagner revolt, Prigozhins complaint was that Putin was not producing enough ammunition to fuel the war effort. \n\nSo based on what I’ve said above, I think Ukraine cannot reclaim their occupied territories, and I think their situation is likely to worsen. I also believe Russia is not going to simply give up and go home, as the Russian political elite are in lockstep around supporting the war. If you disagree, CMV!", "authorship": "human"}

This includes hot water washes or high-heat drying, which clearly use more energy compared to cold water washes or tumble drying with no heat.\n\nFrom an efficiency and fairness standpoint, I believe the cost should be adjusted based on the settings:\n\n- Cold water washes use significantly less energy than hot or warm cycles since they don’t require water heating.\n\n- Tumble drying (no heat) saves energy compared to regular drying cycles, which rely on high heat to remove moisture. Example : Assuming 4kWh for full heat, and 500Wh for tumble dry, assuming 38¢ per kWh, heated dry is at least at least $1 more per hour (cycle) than tumble dry. \n\n\nIt seems unfair that those who opt for eco-friendly, lower-energy settings still have to pay the same price as someone using high heat for both washing and drying. Adjusting pricing based on energy usage would incentivize energy-saving choices and reduce waste.\n\n\nThe counterargument might be that implementing variable pricing systems would be costly or complicated, but I’d argue the technology to account for different settings is already feasible, given that machines can detect and display these options.\n\nChange My View: Why shouldn’t coin-operated washers and dryers adopt variable pricing to reflect energy usage?

All it requires is to take 20 minutes out of your day to read the plethora of freely and easily accessible media located on the internet. Arguments about “fake news” and biased media almost always boil down to opinion pieces being mistakenly taken as unbiased. Further, listening to and reading a wide variety of sources is the only way to become well educated on political issues. No one source will give you an absolutely perfect perfection of the country’s politics. It’s super easy to read one article by Source A and cross reference what you read with Source B.

Doing conventional bombing requires way more planes putting way more of your own pilots at risk and probably would have done more damage to the city, look at the fire bombing of Tokyo. Do you know what the Japanese did with downed pilots? They sent them to universities for students to learn on live subjects. It's your job to keep that number as low as possible. \n\nThere's also the big factor that the biggest invasion in history was about to happen. D-Day would have looked minor in comparison. You do everything you can to reduce the caustities on your side, full stop.\n\n\"Japan was already trying to surrender\"\n\nThey were trying to get a negotiated peace were they get to keep being imperialist dibshits and we would have probably had another war with them at some point if we didn't end it there. The bombings just barely got them to stop. They were talking about just letting Japan be destroyed even after we dropped them. Their surrender speech never said they were surrending and there was a coup attempt to stop that speech from being read. Even after they did officially surrendered the army kept fighting and they had to figure out how to get them all to stop. It's a miracle that we even got them to pay down their arms.\n\n", "authorship": "human"}

They really don't get men's problems. So it shouldn't be their responsibility to help men solve men's problems. Before you say \"why should men care about women's problems then\" the thing is many men are just as dismissive as women, if not more dismissive sometimes. Women are taking care of their own issues, it's time men do the same for their own.\n\nBesides, do you really want a woman who is that dismissive and don't actually care to be involved with men's issues? \n\nYeah no, so I don't think women should be involved in this issue not should we expect them to be involved.

Absolutely.\n\nBut if someone says \"I achieved this by years of hard diligent work\" their work ethic and other virtues imbued by a good upbringing do not make them \"privileged\" in the way it is used today: \"You can't even see your privilege. You were only able to accomplish that because you had smart loving parents who taught you honesty, hard work, and diligence\".  \n\nThose traits are simply who you are, not evidence of your privilege.\n\nEDIT: An important part being missed is when I said \"...in the modern parlance.\"  If you have parents who love you that is in a sense a privilege not enjoyed by an orphan, sure.  In that sense you have *a* privilege, but you are not \"privileged\" in the common parlance of today.   Privilege in the modern parlance, as far as I'm describing here, is that sense of an unfair advantage.  The youngest partner in the history of the firm turns out that his dad is the founder? That's the parlance I'm referring to. \"Born on third base and thinks he hit a triple\" type of privilege.  Being a well-rounded person because your parents did a good job is NOT this type of privilege. \n\nThe post I saw that prompted this was full of people discounting the work required to become a cardiologist because not everyone has parents who instilled good virtuous work and study habits required. If I say \"Most people have a path to success if they apply themselves\", it's inappropriate to reply \"That's just privilege talking! Some of us are shiftless layabouts because we were raised by dirtbags!\" THAT is an inappropriate use of \"privilege\" as we use it in the modern parlance.", "authorship": "human"}
{"Article Number": 32, "title": "East Asian education systems are basically slavery ", "article": "\\* **All the information that I will present in this post came from various sources on the internet. I have read many articles about education systems in China, South Korea, and Japan before. I made this post because I care about students, parents, and teachers in East Asia. I want students, parents and teachers in East Asia to have human rights just like their counterparts in North America and Europe. I have nothing against the people of any East Asian country. Disagree with me if you want because this is a free country after all.** \n\nEast Asian Education systems are well known for being rigorous, demanding and stressful on students in East Asian countries. Many people tend to claim that this is simply due to Asian culture which empasiseses academic success. I throughly disagree with this claim. Based off the information I have gathered from reading about East Asian education, I think that East Asian education systems are they way they are because designed to produce exploitable economic tools for either large companies or the government. East Asian education systems are designed without any regard for the individualized abilities and rights of students because they are designed to make everyone into assets of the same quality. \n\nHere are all the problems with East Asian education systems that make me think that they are basically slavery\n\n\\- No regard for mental disabilities like Dyslexia, ADHD or Autism\n\n\\- No regard for the fact that every person has inherent individual strengths and weaknesses\n\n\\- No regard for the fact that every persons has a style of learning that works best for them\n\n\\- Entirely based on memorization/route learning\n\n\\- No critical thinking\n\n\\- No problem solving\n\n\\- No creativity\n\n\\- Excessive emphasis on obedience\n\n\\- Making academics completive as if they where a sport or competition\n\n\\- Extremely stressful environment\n\n\\- Excessive workload\n\n\\- Lack of motivation for students\n\n\\- Not instilling confidence in students\n\n\\- Coercing students to only pursue specific white collar careers instead of allowing them to pursue any career they want \n\n\\- Teachers abusing students for poor academic performance which they have little to no control over\n\nIn my opinion education in East Asia is like the enslavement of Jews by the Nazis or the ensalvement of Africans in pre-civil war America. In all three of these instances massive numbers of people are forced to work extremely hard in deplorable conditions for people who are more powerful than them, who give them little in return for their work, and who abuse them when they do not meet there egotistical expectations. All three of these instances are based on the idea of only viewing people who do work as assets and nothing else. The only thing that determines the value of people who work under slavery is there ability to meet there masters expectations which the master takes for granted.  \n\nSouth Korea and Japans education systems are designed to produce exploitable economic tools for the Chaebols and Keiretsus respectively. Chinas education system is designed to produce exploitable tools for the various greedy and unethical companies which work under the Chinese Communist Parties model of authoritarian capitalism. Taiwans education system is a remnant of the Japanese colonial era and the military dictatorship which has yet to be replaced with a normal ethical education system. Each East Asian countries education system is the way it is for different reasons but that does not change the fact that they violate human rights. \n\nIt's not just students who suffer from East Asian education system. Teachers also work in excessively stressful and abusive conditions. Teachers are treated by there bosses the same way they treat there students. East Asian education systems are a tiered system of mistreatment with the people in charge of teachers on the top and the students on the bottom. Each level in the system abuses the level beneath it. Many East Asian parents tend to be demanding, abusive, and entitled regarding there children's academic performance because there child's academic performance is one of the very few things in there lives which they can control. In East Asian countries, teachers and parents also do not have human rights and they utilize their students academic performance as a way to distract themselves from the fact that they do not have human rights. In addition many East Asian teachers are also underpaid (due to the greed of there employers) which is another fact of there lives that they distract themselves from with their students academic performance. \n\nEast Asian education systems do not give students better lives because the workforce in East Asian countries is just as slavery like as there education systems. In China, South Korea and Japan people work extremely long hours with no-breaks and only have one day off each week. Even if these students succeed in their education and get employed by white collar employers, they will not be able to spend the money they earn on anything they want because they simply won't have the time. Also the extremely intensive studying for the college entrance exams in East Asian education systems also causes physical and mental health issues which impair working ability. East Asian education systems are systems where students are educated in a manner where they are slaves and the job they are being forced to do is to memorize enough information to meet there teachers expectations. East Asian students are basically people who are being educated to be slaves because the work that they will be forced to do as slaves requires extensive education . There are no other instances in human history where slaves needed to be educated to do the work that their master forces them to do. In this sense education in East Asia is a step above historical instances of slavery like the Nazi enslavement of Jews or the enslavement of Africans in pre-civil war America. \n\nNorth America and Europe have proven that technological and economic progress can be made without education systems that work like slavery. If East Asian education systems where good as there supporters claim them to be then America would not have landed and man on the moon and Europe would not have made all of its progress in clean energy. Raw academic knowledge on its own will not enable actual innovation. Actual sci-tech innovation also requires critical thinking, problem solving and creativity alongside academic knowledge. It's also much easier for students to gain academic knowledge in environments that are not excessively stressful or abusive. All of the sci-tech progress made by East Asian countries is despite not because of there slavery like education systems. \n\nI hope that criticism of East Asian education systems becomes more widespread and well known. The injustices permeated by these slavery like education systems needs to be exposed to not just the public in East Asian countries but also the world. Education should be a part of life where people feel interested, motivated and respected. Slavery is does not instill interest, motivation or respect in students or anyone else involved in education. All education systems across the world should strive to unlock the different potentials in each person in a manner that adheres to human rights. ", "authorship": "human"}

You are immediately deciding to have no sympathy for a bunch of strangers simply bc of their monetary status. Now, the rich elites are not better. They have no sympathy for the poor, they don’t care about people in need or the working class (as many of the Reddit posts on this topic discuss). I’m not defending this particular action of the elites, I am simply saying that both sides are just equating the value of human life with wealth. One side thinks that having an abundance of wealth should automatically grant you more, while the other side automatically demonizes and lacks any sympathy for anyone wealthy. It’s not right that rich elites don’t have any regard for the lives of people in need bc they don’t like poor people, BUT it’s not okay for the working class to lack a regard for the lives of the rich bc of their wealth.

", "article": "To start, I understand that love is love and people are going to do what they want anyways.. \n\nHowever, I believe that given the increased importance of height in society, if you are a tall man who wants to have kids one day it’s in your best interest to also date women that are relatively close to your height. \n\nFor better or for worse height is becoming more important in society, and being tall provides advantages for so many aspects of life. Most people are meeting online now a days where height is being filtered. Social media sites are filled with people demonizing short men/talking about height, with women very openly expressing their preferences online and referring to tall men as “prime real estate”. \n\nHowever, a lot of these women who only date men significantly taller than them, and value a big “height difference”, go on to have sons with these men that are at heights they wouldn’t have deemed viable. \n\nThe estimated adult height of a boy is calculated by averaging the height of the father and adding 5” to the mother. For example, if the father is 6” and the mother is 5”7, the adult height of the boy should be 6”. \n\nThis isn’t always the case and there are outliers, how ever this average is calculated for a reason as it usually ends up being correct. \n\nI know a guy that’s 6”4 who was boasting about how he slept with a bunch of women over the last few months, and was bragging about all his matches. When I told him to remember the advantages his height gave him when settling down, he got upset and said that height doesn’t matter. The reality is that most of those women would not have swiped right on him if it wasn’t for how tall he is. \n\nI work with a guy that’s pretty tall that takes a lot of pride in his height. Even insulting other male coworkers for being “short”, when his finance is 5” tall. If they have a son together he likely will grow up to be shorter then him. \n\nYou might think this is an awful way to see dating and I agree. But unfortunately with the way we’re moving backwards as a society, it’s in your best interest to act accordingly. \n\nThe fact is, many of these women are only dating/were initially interested in these men based on their height, so therefore I think from an evolutionary standpoint it’s foolish to compromise that advantage for your offspring. \n\nI’m average height in my country (5”10), and for every one couple I see in public where the man is my height or shorter, I see at least 3-4 couples where the man’s at or over 6 feet. I’m decently taller then 80% of the women in these relationships. I’m hesitant to date a women under 5”5, and mostly date women closer to my height or taller. \n\nDoes my dating “preferences” contradict me talking about the importance height? Perhaps. But I would argue I am the exception and not the rule. Should these women I date not be doing “charity work” for dating a man under 6 feet? Perhaps. But that’s their decision and not mine. \n\nI may come off as bitter, jealous and having a fragile male ego, but the reality is that this stems from my observations of society around me. \n\nIn conclusion, people can do what they want as mentioned initially, however I believe dating shorter women as a tall man is a bad idea overall if you plan on having kids one day.

{"Article Number": 43, "title": "Anti victim blaming has gone too far", "article": "I used to think victim blaming just meant reducing the rapists moral/legal/social responsibility of the crime that they committed or lessening the victims victimhood status. I always have thought that is wrong and my opinion has not changed. But I learned recently that some consider much broader definitions, for example [link](https://www.sace.ca/learn/victim-blaming/) which includes this line: “It’s questioning people who experience violence — especially sexual violence — about their actions, and what they could have done to prevent it….” This extends victim blaming to analyzing violence to identify defenses and educating people on those defenses. Shaming this leads to more people getting assaulted. \n\nI also realize there is a time and place for this victim blaming. But this is an issue of unwanted advice which is usually simply rude and in the case of traumatic experiences is extremely insensitive. Telling a victim who wasn’t looking for advice what they could have done better in their personal situation is not acceptable. However, I recently found out that even a victim discussing what safety measures could be taken to try and educate others on safety is seen by some as victim blaming and is worthy of vitriolic personal attacks.\n\nMy opinion is that either the definition needs to be narrower, or we have to say victim blaming is a moral good when it comes to responsibly investigating and educating about safety measures. Telling others that if they want to be safe, they could take self defense classes, that they could make sure their doors are locked, that they could not be alone with people who have not earned a lot of trust is educating people on safety, not putting meaningful blame on the victim. Someone who does not do any of those steps does not deserves assault at all any more than someone who does all of them. But you can educate on safety without saying or implying that.\n\nSome of the counter arguments: \n\n1. People already know how to be safe: Any information about safety is either speculative or was learned by people looking at these violent acts and determining what worked and did not work. This fits under the broader definition of victim blaming. So no victim blaming means no building on or updating this information other than through speculation.\n\n2. We should tell potential offenders not to assault people instead as they are the morally responsible ones: Sure but this is a societal solution and you can simultaneously have a societal solution (political/cultural) that you advocate for politically and personal solution that you use to reduce your risk if you choose to. Not mutually exclusive with my view.\n\n3. Some victims did everything and still got assaulted: Safety is never guaranteed, it is about probabilities. I would never say that advocating to have a lock on your front door sucks because a bank had a full vault and someone still figured out how to crack that vault.\n\n4. The very discussion is traumatic to victims: And we have safe spaces for victims to heal, building on those seems like the correct solution to this problem.

I think Biden is the worst president in my lifetime, and honestly, despite all his flaws, I think Trump has many good characteristics that put him over Biden and definitely Kamala for me.\n\nFor four years, I have very much disliked Biden. I felt he was mentally inept, he wasn't true to his word, botched COVID, and, with the majority of my family in the military, they and I believe he really messed up the pullout. I didn't agree with many of his approaches across various policies and believe he just fueled the divide.\n\nThe last month or so, though, I finally feel a little better about him generally, and I think it's because he finally just gave the middle finger to the Democratic Party.\n\n* He got pushed out after winning the nomination, and I think they brought a lot of Republicans to a level of sympathy for him. Additionally, for four years, we felt it was almost terrible to have him out there given his mental state. When they pushed him out, it validated all those feelings, where I went from distaste to sympathy.\n* Throughout the election, he would undermine Kamala, and it was kind of refreshing to see him just be himself and say what he means instead of being a puppet.\n* He said recently he thinks he could have beaten Trump, which is like a \"F\\*ck you\" to the Dems.\n* He admitted he couldn't have served four more years because of his health, and there is something to the fact that he finally admitted, \"Yeah, I am old, and I don't have it; you are right.\"\n* Biden pardoned his son, which, even though I think it was wrong and means he just blatantly lied, also fueled Republicans' belief that the justice system is weaponized, so everything against Trump doesn't matter. But it also humanized him, as he did it because it is his son and he is a father.\n* Then yesterday was the one that made me really think Biden is alright: when the ceasefire happened in Israel, Biden went out of his way to say the peace was implemented and pulled off thanks to Trump's team. He obviously said his team was in negotiations, but he specifically said the peace deal was \"implemented by Trump.\" I respect that he gave credit to the incoming president, especially on such a major issue, and I KNOW the Dems DID NOT want him to say that, as it basically boosts Trump majorly as the peacemaker.", "authorship": "human"}

One side believes in process and order and principle and objectivity and [deontological ethics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/) more broadly, ie that the rightness of action is based on following good rules, rather than achieving good outcomes; while the other side believes in pragmatics and outcomes and 'for the greater good' and subjectivity and [consequentialist ethics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/) more broadly, ie that the rightness of action is based on the outcome, rather than by following universal rules. The thing is, the former is literally what law is in liberal countries like the US. The latter is the divinely-inspired king judging everything on a case-by-case basis and what 'feels' correct, with no concern about inconsistencies or predictable outcomes based on actions.\n\nI know everyone will say that the reversal of Roe v Wade was a political decision, but answer me this: why didn't they reinterpret the Constitution to grant fetuses personhood status, thus ensuring they have the same rights as newborns? I'm sure the 6 justices who voted to overturn Roe would all prefer a nationwide ban on abortion, or, at the very least, for abortion to be illegal everywhere (even if they aren't a fan of the federal government's involvement). And yet they didn't do that; all they did was overturn abortion as a Constitutionally protected *right*, allowing states to set their own laws about abortion.\n\nThe reason for that is obvious. Because Roe v Wade was bad law. It was bad law because it was a set of judges attempting to legislate what they think is good, rather than defining what the Constitution says. The Supreme Court's job is not to achieve good ends, except insofar as following the Constitution is a good end. If the Constitution enables or guarantees bad, it is the job of legislatures to write new laws (if the Constitution does not guarantee/prohibit something that legislators believe should be guaranteed/prohibited) or new constitutional amendments (if the Constitution guarantees/prohibits something that legislators believe should not be guaranteed/prohibited).\n\nIf you look at Supreme Court rulings, the so-called 'right wing' justices are much more likely to rule against their own personal beliefs of what the law *should* be and in favor of what the law *is*, while the left wing justices are almost guaranteed to interpret the law in the exact same way that they would choose to write the law if they were legislators.\n\nSo yes, the court is political, but only insofar as one half's political beliefs inhibit them from judicial activism, while the other half's political beliefs expressly encourage them to be legislate from the bench. A court of 9 right wing justices would not result in a right wing country, but a court of 9 left wing justices almost certainly would.", "authorship": "human"}

Cognitive Shortcuts:\nThe brain often relies on heuristics or mental shortcuts to process information quickly. Judging based on surface-level traits reduces cognitive load in a world with overwhelming stimuli.\n\n3.) Social Conditioning:\nSociety places significant value on outward appearances, such as beauty, status, and material wealth. Media and culture reinforce these ideals, teaching people to prioritize surface-level traits over deeper qualities.\n\n4.) First Impressions:\nFirst impressions are formed within seconds and heavily influence how people perceive each other. This immediate assessment often relies on visible, superficial attributes like clothing, grooming, or body language. This is in line with the “Primacy Effect”\n\n5.) Tribalism and Group Identity:\nSuperficial markers like clothing, language, or appearance often signal group membership or shared values. Humans are naturally drawn , through evolutionary mechanisms, to those who seem familiar, reinforcing surface-level judgment.\n\nWhile humans are capable of deeper thought and connection, superficiality is often the default mode, especially in fast-paced, judgment-driven environments.", "authorship": "human"}

", "article": "In my years of researching geopolitics, I’ve never quite understood how the democrats can justify defending NATO members that don’t meet the 2% of GDP spending target. It's a fairly low-bar to pass, thus why so many other nations have achieved it with minimal effort/sacrifice. Hence, I believe it's perfectly reasonable to “pull the plug” so to speak, on nations that refuse to contribute their fair share. I personally like to think of NATO as a de facto “defence insurance” against hostile nations, in which those whom refuse to pay don’t get insured in the event of a conflict. As an added bonus; Europe will likely become more self-sufficient when it comes to funding/maintain an adequate defence, resulting in lesser need for US intervention were a conflict to break-out.", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 87, "title": "Yes, Taka is a villain. But its not entirely his fault.", "article": "In the new 'Mufasa' movie, a prequel to 'The Lion King' live action remake, we learn the backstory of Mufasa and Taka (Scar).\n\nIn this movie we learn that Taka is the prince (and future king) of a small pride of lions. He rescues a young Mufasa who was separated from his pride by a flood.\n\nWe learn that Taka's pride is massacred by a group of outsider lions, Mufasa is tasked with protecting Taka until he can build a pride of his own.\n\nThroughout the movie, Taka saves Mufasa's life multiple times.\n\nDuring this journey, the two young males also meet Sarabi, a princess of a neighbouring pride (who eventually becomes Mufasa's mate and they have Simba).\n\nThere is no exact point at which Taka becomes a villain. It is a rhetoric that is ingrained in him since he was born. His father coaxes his entitlement.\n\n**Obasi, Taka's father, does not allow Taka to associate with the females of the pride. He claims that Taka is too good to hunt with the females, that he is the future of the pride and his bloodline must be protected. He instils an understanding that Taka is entitled to rule. (Mufasa, and outcast, is allowed to hunt with the females and thus fosters a better understanding of the struggles of the females of the pride).\n\nSo, when Sarabi is introduced, Taka falls in love, and his entitlement (fueled by his father's teachings) for a relationship with Sarabi grows. To the point where he convinces Mufasa to lie about who saved Sarabi during a stampede to make himself look better (among other things like recognising the scent of flowers on her coat).\n\nMufasa, being loyal to his brother, obeys. And it wasn't until Sarabi confronted him with evidence that he told the truth.\n\nMufasa, having had experience with interacting with female lions since his youth, is more comfortable speaking with Sarabi and they bond more quickly. Taka is not so lucky, as his father's commands meant he was unable to develop any meaningful communication skills with the females of his pride, he struggles to bond with Sarabi.\n\n**Still, Taka feels entitled to Sarabi because of his understanding that his destiny is to be king, and kings choose their mates. But, what Takas father failed to teach him is that a King without a pride is nothing, no other pride will recognise a solitary male as a king. So for a king to come from nothing, he must earn it.\n\nNow, whilst Taka does save Mufasa multiple times, he also repeatably shows himself as a coward.\n\nMufasa, on the other hand, repeatably defends others and shows little cowardace.\n\n(Many people site that Taka saved Mufasa multiple times and whilst there were few incidences where Mufasa protected Taka, there were many demonstrations of Mufasa protecting other lions such as Sarabi and Taka's mother, despite terrible odds)\n\nWhen Sarabi declared her love for Mufasa and her disinterest in Taka, Taka takes this as the last straw of \"things he's lost\" (despite Sarabi never being his to claim) and betrayed Mufasa by leading the lions that massacred his own family to Mufasa so they could have revenge on him for killing the prince of their pride (who Mufasa killed in defense of Taka's mother - Taka fled this fight instead of helping his mother and adopted brother, he didn't even go to get help, he just ran away).\n\nAlthough Taka ultimately changes his mind and saves Mufasa again, he still goes on to spend the rest of his life plotting to reclaim the throne (and Sarabi in turn).\n\n**TL;TR:\nTakas entitlement, fueled by Obasi's teachings, is what ultimately led Taka to villainhood.\n\nAnd that's not inherently Taka's fault. That's Obasi's fault for raising Taka under the assumption that he would always have the witness of the rest of the pride to speak for his claim to royalty.\n\nObasi never thought to raise his child to prepare for a world where he does not have the privilege of family to back up his claim to a throne.\n\nNot only this, but Obasi instils that Taka is somehow more entitled to becoming a king than the royalty of any other neighbouring pride displaced by the outsiders that killed Obasi's pride.", "authorship": "human"}

The review of academic works and empirical data on that matter only allow us to say that the likelyness of a social media user to be ideologically isolated in an echo chamber depends mostly on the user's media consumtion practices and the plateforms they use. \n\n\"There are a number of areas where our review suggests that there is a clear \nmajority view in academic research, including most notably: \n\n● Politically partisan online news echo chambers are generally small – much smaller than is often assumed in public and policy debate. \n\n● Automated serendipity and incidental exposure mean that relying on search engines, social media, and other digital platforms using algorithmic ranking leads people to slightly more diverse news – the opposite of what the filter bubble hypothesis posits. \n\n● Self-selection, both along partisan lines and, importantly, in terms of levels of interest, plays a significant role in shaping news and media use. \n\n● There is no single uniform trend towards greater polarisation – ideological polarisation has declined in some countries, affective polarisation has increased, news audience polarisation varies greatly, and in every case, country-specific factors seem decisive, not a single global trend like the rise of the internet. \n\n● Elite cues continue to play an important role in shaping both news coverage And public opinion, with the behaviour of political parties and individual prominent politicians often contributing to polarisation, whether around Ideological issues or science issues such as climate change. \n\nGiven the amount of research on these issues arriving at broadly similar conclusions, the burden of proof now, in our view, is on those arguing for \nalternative interpretations to provide systematic evidence. \"\n\nhttps://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:6e357e97-7b16-450a-a827-a92c93729a08\n\nThe second point I wanna tackle is the idea that Reddit is a worse plateform than twitter or others social media because it's a bigger echo chamber. \n\nAccording to this study it's quite the opposite, information diffusion is less biaised on Reddit than it is on twitter or facebook. \n\n\"These results indicate that information diffusion is biased toward individuals who share a similar leaning in some social media, namely Twitter and Facebook. In contrast, in others—Reddit and Gab in our analysis—this effect is absent.\" \n\nhttps://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2023301118\n\nSo next time you wanna bring the argument that social media plateforms are glorifiee echo chambers and Reddit is that big scary leftwing echo chamber, you will know that your opinion does not reflect state of the art in communication sciences and sociology of the media. \n", "authorship": "human"}

As to business practice on how much you pay your employees, that is different between owners and philosophies.\n\nI believe in paying your workers their fair wage, taking care of their families and giving benefits where needed and where you can. However a fair wage is relative. I would go as far as to say that the majority of Americans have a spending problem, and that’s not to say we don’t hav economical issues like wages stagnant and everything else is inflated, but that for people with money problems, they will have money problems regardless of how much money you give them because they only spend their money on liabilities and not assets.\n\nThe only entitled people are workers who think that every business they work for, owes them everything.

{"Article Number": 95, "title": "I hate it when people simplify complex ideas and think they’re smart for it. It’s the opposite.", "article": "Context: It’s when an idea is nuanced, yet people act like you’re overcomplicating things when all you’re doing is showing that it’s not so simple. You explain your reasoning thoroughly, but they ignore everything you’ve said and respond with something like, \"Just bla bla bla, simple. No need to overcomplicate. \". \n\nHere is a concrete example:\n\n**Me:** \"If we’re talking about sugar in the context of health, there are two categories of sugar to be aware of: simple sugars and complex sugars. You shouldn’t consume more than 36g of simple sugar in a day, but for complex sugars, it’s okay to eat more, as long as you’re mindful of the calories. Simple sugars are found in beverages, processed foods, etc., while complex sugars are found in fruits, rice, and similar foods. However, fruit juice should be counted as simple sugar because it’s just as damaging. In fact, we don’t need simple sugar at all.\"\n\n**The Typical:** \"Why can’t you just say sugar is bad? Simple and easy to understand.\"\n\nThen, they proceed to stop eating all kinds of sugar, rice, corn, pasta—anything with carbohydrates—and later blame \"science\" for making them sick. In reality, they are the ones who oversimplified the information, misunderstood it, and hurt themselves because of it.\n\nNext, they do a 180 flip. Since \"science\" supposedly hurt them, they turn to their like-minded peers to echo the sentiment that \"science is bad.\" Now, they go to the opposite extreme: eating all kinds of sugar without moderation. Over time, they gain additional weight and develop long-term health issues from consuming too much simple sugar.\n\nThe reality is, some concepts simply can’t be simplified without losing crucial details. It’s not complicated by choice—it’s complicated by necessity. Most things in life are not that simple.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Another Example:**  \n**Me:** \"The news is very biased. If you only listen to one side, it can brainwash you into siding with them.\"  \n**Context:** I’m talking to someone who ONLY watches Chinese media and believes China is the leader in space travel.  I'm not against China, but this is simply not true.\n\n**Them:** \"But this is international news—it’s available to everyone. They can’t lie, or there would be consequences. Everyone can see it. They wouldn’t lie.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Outright lying isn’t the only way they can manipulate you. There are many ways. For instance, they can only report their successes while showing only the failures of others. This creates the illusion that their side is winning, even though the reality could be the opposite. For example, if China highlights two of its successful launches but hides ten failures, while only reporting two U.S. failures and ignoring ten U.S. successes, you’re going to think China is ahead. But in reality, it’s just cherry-picking data. No one holds them accountable for this because they technically didn’t lie. They just omitted information to create a narrative. You can’t sue a media outlet for omitting details. And even if someone calls them out for it, you wouldn’t know, because you only get information from them.\"\n\n**Them:** They refuse to comprehend and keep repeating: \"But it’s international news. Everyone can see it. If they do anything bad, there would be consequences. They wouldn’t do that.\"\n\n**Me:** In disbelief, I try another example: \"Another way they could manipulate is by presenting allegations as if they were convictions. For instance, anyone could falsely accuse you of rape—\"\n\n**Them:** They cut me off. \"DON’T say someone might sue me for that. It’s negative! Blah blah blah.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Okay, let’s say it’s John. If someone hates John, they could arrange for a false accusation of rape. The media could title it, 'John Alleged to Have Sexually Abused a College Student.' Most people don’t care about 'innocent until proven guilty.' They’ll assume it’s true just from the headline. The majority of the population actually behave this way. Just look at Johny Dep; you're probably one as well.\n\n**Them:** \"Nah, they wouldn’t do that.\"\n\n**Me:** got mad, and start explaining it in obvious way.  \nThem: \"Why can't you just simply say the news outlet is fake\".  \nMe: BUT IT's NOT FAKE, OMG.   \n  \nThey simplify \"News can manipulate you\" into two extremes:\n\n1. \"News won’t lie because there’s accountability.\"\n2. \"News is fake, so never trust any news.\"\n\nReality is far more nuanced. The media often uses omission, selective reporting, and framing to manipulate narratives without technically lying. This isn’t \"complicating\" the issue—it’s acknowledging how manipulation works in practice. And the solution isn't to completely trust the news or completely ignore the news. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nAnother:  \n**Them:** \"Complicated math is useless outside of school.\"  \n**Me:** \"It depends on what you do! If you’re flipping burgers, playing sports, working as a lawyer, or in some subsets of business and other professions, then yes, it’s useless because you’re not going to use it. But for those interested in fields like engineering, computer science, and similar areas, this math isn’t anywhere near useless—it’s foundational. The same people who claim math is useless are never the ones designing airplanes, creating games, building bridges blueprints, or tackling complex engineering marvels.\"\n\n**Them:** \"But I’ve never had to use it, and I’m still doing fine.\"  \n**Me:** \"I know, and that’s because you’re not interested in a field that requires it. But you’re assuming that everyone’s goal is just to be 'doing fine.' What about people who are passionate about fields that depend on advanced math and want to work in those areas? If they take your advice, they’re screwed.\"\n\nThem: \"Well, just don't do those job, only money matter anyway, simple and easy to understand\".  \n\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThere’s so much more I could say, but the point is that when you simplify something, you’re inevitably dropping important details. That’s literally the only way to simplify.\n\nAnd don’t hit me with the quote, *\"If you can’t explain it to a 5-year-old, you don’t really understand it.\"* That’s complete nonsense. You absolutely can’t explain something like general relativity to a 5-year-old without skipping 90% of the details that make it functional.\n\nIf you think you understand general relativity, try simplifying it for a 5-year-old. You’ll quickly realize that what you’re presenting isn’t the real thing—it’s a dumbed-down version. People often mistake understanding a simplified version for understanding the actual concept. But knowing a watered-down explanation is not the same as truly understanding the full complexity.\n\nNow, as for the title, Simplifying complex ideas is not smart, it's the opposite. \n\nI said that because people often mistake the ability to simplify as something \"smart.\" It’s not. Simplifying is the easy part—you just omit all the details, and things become simple. That’s how most people do it, and they get praised for it. But it’s easy to do that.\n\nWhat’s hard is actually tackling the problem head-on and being willing to dig through all the nuance. That’s the smart part—being critical and thoughtful rather than a simpleton. Simplifying is easy because all you’re doing is omitting details.\n\nFor example:\n\n* It's much easier to say \"Don't eat sugar\" or \"It's okay to eat sugar\" rather than explain that there are different kind of sugar. \n* It's much easier to say \"The news is fake\" or \"The news is not fake\" rather than to explain how news can manipulate you and how you can resist it. \n* It's much easier to say \"Math is useless\" or \"Math is useful\" rather than explaining how it's subjective to individual. \n* It’s much easier to say, \"John stole because he’s a bad person,\" than to say, \"John stole. His action is wrong, but there might be a reason for it—maybe he was desperate. This doesn’t justify it, but understanding the reasoning helps.\"\n* It’s much easier to say, \"Women and men are the same,\" than to say, \"There are areas where women are better than men and areas where men are better than women. We are generally different, but we all deserve the same rights, opportunities, and treatment.\"\n* It’s much easier to say, \"You hate Black people, so you’re racist,\" than to say, \"You’re not racist. You hate John because he stole from you, and he happens to be Black. It’s not about his skin color; it’s about his actions. You would hate anyone who did that, regardless of race.\"\n\nAs you can see, simplifying things is easy. It’s not a \"smart\" skill—it’s the opposite, because it involves omitting important details. When people choose not to simplify something, it’s not because they can’t; it’s because they value accurate information and don’t want to leave out essential details. You inability to comprehend complex idea, doesn't mean your \"simplify\" everything trait is smart. ", "authorship": "human"}

But it started getting old and tired by the time of the Beauty and the Beast one, and as we started to come up on Aladdin and the Lion King, it starts to become clear to most of us what's wrong with it (other than it just being a cynical, systematic cash grab).\n\nThese movies weren't *made* to be serious-looking, live-action dramas.

And I have to say, RedNote makes for a pretty unusual option for a TikTok substitute.\n\n- The user experience is much closer to something like Instagram than TikTok: you scroll down a whole menu of posts, the posts don't take up the entire screen, and the nature of the content aligns more closely with what you'd find on Instagram or Pinterest than on either TikTok or China's version of TikTok (Douyin).\n\n- There are other apps out there like Meta's Instagram Reels or Google's YouTube Shorts that provide the same (or better) functionality and even content, but aren't owned by China and therefore avoid the same security concerns (however valid you believe they are) as ByteDance. Like, why promote another Chinese app as the de facto \"canonical\" TikTok clone if there's a very good chance that either a)  the US government uses the same legislation to ban it in turn too, or b) the Chinese government decides to segregate the app into a walled-off ID-required version for their own citizens, and a more \"open\" one for foreigners... which is exactly how Douyin and TikTok respectively have operated?\n\n- No offense, but the design of RedNote is absolutely horrid compared to any of the others. A lot of the features aren't even functional, you're forced to select from a tiny predetermined music library, and hashtags are so buggy when trying to input English (Latin)-alphabet tags that for a while I didn't even know using them was possible. Furthermore, almost all the information is in Chinese, and I'd wager only a small fraction of TikTok's userbase speaks or understands that language (though it's great that people are trying to learn!)\n\n- Many (albeit not all) of the recent \"hi, I am a TikTok refugee from the US\" posts on RedNote are written in far inferior English than what I'd typically expect from Americans who use TikTok. I did a little scrutinization to see if any of the ones I saw were Chinese users mocking Americans, while unlike (non-Chinese) TikTok and Instagram but standard for Chinese social media, users are automatically marked with their country of residence (or province if in China), most of the posts in question do indeed indicate US provenance, but then again, location should be fairly easy to spoof if you've got an agenda on your hands. (They're also often fairly basic in quality, especially compared to TikToks, but that could be chalked to the aforementioned limitations of the platform's editor.)\n\nThere are so many confusing questions, and to me, a lot of this just simply doesn't add up. What I think could be happening is that the TikTokers jumping ship to RedNote represent only a specific subset of users whose parents, relatives, or close (IRL) friends might use RedNote out of familiarity with the platform and the Chinese language, and it's catching on to the general TikTok userbase in much smaller proportions than all those news articles are ready to admit (with most of the \"normies\" just heading over to YouTube Shorts or Instagram Reels, if they weren't there already).\n\nI'm also willing to consider the possibility that it's some government that could be behind this, but I'm just not sure which. If it's the US government, then why would they make a big fuss over one Chinese app only to prop up another? And if it's the PRC (or Russian, etc.) government, then why would they be so keen on letting foreign TikTokers - their own \"brainwashing\" victims, if you believe this, though I don't, which is another story - roam free on what generally tend to be walled-off spaces on the Chinese internet?", "authorship": "human"}

They literally auto moderate posts that include anything regarding Tiananmen square, Chinese mistreatment of Uyghur Muslims and other general anti-CCP rhetoric. I think much of it has to do with the anti-Trump, pro-Palestine stance much of TikTok has adopted. However, I feel that's just the CCP indirectly projecting its own geopolitical interests upon western citizens. Yet somehow vast amounts of leftist's support banning/regulating sites like X and 4chan on the basis of “hate speech”.  \n\nThe double standard is hilarious when the left supported Brazil banning X; then later became outraged after the US considered a TikTok ban. I think the root cause of the issue is leftists wanting echo-chambers. The idea of migrating to a site like X after a TikTok ban and having to deal with someone whom may have a different opinion simply infuriates them. It somewhat stems from TikTok being a very politically-sheltered platform when it comes to leftists not having to deal with conservative/alt-right opinions.

There are no 'real' arguments agaist gay marriage.

Yes, they do believe that banning guns will help keep them out of the hands of criminals, or reduce the risk of accidental gun deaths. Or at least that is the intention anyway. I do not find them **good** arguments, because I disagree with them, but they still have *some* debatable merit to them. I believe the right to self-defense, and not restricting law abiding citizens because of the acts of deranged criminals, are **stronger** arguments.

{"Article Number": 174, "title": "Computer Science is the worst major you could choose.", "article": "Hey everyone, I just wanted to share an opinion on college majors and career paths. **Don’t major in Computer Science.** After you graduate with a computer science degree, it can be nearly impossible to get a job. This is because the field is oversaturated. Everyone and their grandparent is trying to get a job in computer science because of one thing: \"MONEY.\" . I majored in English, and I don’t regret it. I am in debt, but the reality is that I’m probably never going to pay it off in my lifetime. Who cares right? I went to college for the experience and to improve my writing skills.\n\nI believe an English major is better than a computer science major for three reasons:\n\n1. English teaches you communication skills and helps you become better at arguments.\n2. Language and Liberal Arts degrees are typically easier, less stressful, and less competitive than STEM degrees.\n3. Finally, the ROI (Return on Investment) isn’t very good these days.\n\nCommunication is very important, both on a casual and a professional level. You’d be surprised how many new grads in Gen Z have poor communication skills. If you read a job application, almost all of them require excellent verbal and written communication skills. These are skills that can be developed through public speaking and liberal arts classes. You might argue that English is a universal language, which is true, but you would be surprised by how many immigrants and people who come to the U.S. don’t speak English well. Developing strong communication skills can set you apart from other applicants.\n\nThere are current trends and studies suggesting that Gen Z is reading below grade level. Back in the 70s and 60s, 70% of children were reading books; now, that number has dwindled down to about 15%. This shift is due to kids spending too much time on electronics, and it will have a major impact on the workforce.\n\nI get it—difficulty is subjective. What I find difficult, you might not, and vice versa. There are many studies showing that many STEM degrees have a higher dropout rate compared to liberal arts majors. Also, grades in STEM fields are often curved, which means they depend on how the entire class does. Curving grades can create an unhealthy competitive environment, which isn’t ideal. I know that some non-STEM areas of study also have curved grades, but it’s much more common in STEM fields.\n\nROI is important when choosing a college major, and in my opinion, STEM degrees generally have a poor ROI. I know someone who happens to be my brother’s older cousin’s friend. He graduated from MIT with a computer science degree. He paid about $80K a year for his degree, had a few scholarships, but after graduating, he found himself $270K in debt. That’s not ideal. He will likely never pay it off unless he wins the lottery. The same can be true for most computer science degrees—even if you go to a state school, you could end up with over $80K in debt if you're not careful.\n\nJust a bonus reason for you folks: English and language arts majors have more job opportunities. You could become a teacher or a writer, which can earn a good amount of money. The chances of becoming the next J.K. Rowling are higher than you might think, if you consider the statistics and perform the calculations. Most importantly, an English degree can set you up for law school.\n\nFinal verdict: Stay away from computer science. It’s too hard, and it won’t help you “get women” in college or in real life. You’ll probably end up depressed in your dorm room, smoking weed and possibly even resorting to harder substances trying to finish projects. Most importantly, college isn’t just about getting a job—it’s about getting an education. There's a difference, folks. At the end of my English class, we watched a movie. How cool is that? In computer science, they just give you boring tests.\n\nI’ve noticed that many computer science majors can be rude, and they often think they’re better than others. But in reality, most of them are pretty dumb and lame.\n\nTLDR; Major in liberal arts not computer science", "authorship": "human"}

I'm from the US so my government). That would cause the prices to drop like a rock.

No one knows exactly when or where, but it is certain that California will experience more wildfires and Florida will experience more hurricanes, especially as global warming exacerbates these climatic consequences. Considering this, states and localities should bear the burden of planning for and repairing the damage from these circumstances.\n\nIt is fundamentally unfair that people who live in more safe and sustainable regions of the country must subsidize the dangerous development patterns of those who choose to live in disaster-prone areas. It is also short-sighted because it incentivizes less resilient settlement patterns, meaning more people are harmed and displaced by disasters in the future. Many people affected by recent disasters likely wouldn't have been there and therefore would not have suffered in the first place if the risks were appropriately priced--both California and Flordia have kept home insurance artificially low for years. Or their homes wouldn't have been destroyed because the proper pricing of insurance would effectively necessitate more durable designs.\n\nTo the extent the federal government provides any aid for predictable natural disasters, it should either be as a loan to smooth out the cost shock or as an insurance plan individual states buy into which is calibrated to its region's risk level. We already intuitively understand this as fair for quasi-predictable events that affect individuals: the federal government doesn't come running to buy you a new house if you neglect to buy homeowners insurance and a pipe bursts, flooding it. For healthcare, too, we either expect individuals to buy personal insurance plans or, in countries with universal/public coverage, negative externalities on risky consumption are appropriately taxed to offset its societal cost (eg taxes on alcohol, tobacco, fat, sugar etc.).\n\nWhere I do think the federal government should offer aid is for disasters/emergencies that are truly unforeseen like a meteor strike or a terror attack.

At the same time, note also that if you were raised poorly, any unfamiliar situation is going to inherently feel weird. Your \"intuition\" is going to paint unfamiliarity as bad. Let's also acknowledge that with a 50% divorce rate, most of your intuition(s) are collectively, not that spectacular \n\n\\-Discomfort: Going off of what I just said, if you're uncomfortable, that isn't inherently a bad thing if you're living a shitty life. Next. \n\n\\-Any kind of isms:  People who have issues with various isms have negative feelings, and look to constantly re-justify the feelings they already feel. It doesn't matter how many positive interactions with a group they've had, for example, a sexist man is always going to think I'm stupid no matter how much I show I'm not stupid. Even if I am impressive, I'll be seen as an \"exception\" to other women. Same with any other minority group \n\n  \n\\-Distrust in institutions: \n\n\\----Medical: When people rely on \"intuition\" they use their feelings to justify how they feel, to make themselves feel important. For example, a Mom living in the woods on Tiktok may appeal to your anxiety as a Mother by telling you a vaccines are bad and there are much better ways to help your child. However, an actual Doctor who slaved away in medical school is not going to tell you the same thing, and isn't going to appeal to your not-always-rational anxiety. \n\n\\----Universities: A general disillusionment with society makes people distrust higher-education, which is alarming, because it's literally just more information designed to make them question their world views. It's more comforting to accept that others are plotting against you than to accept your world views on a lot of important topics are limited or wrong. \n\n\\----Cities: Deeply disturbing how there is an inherent distrust of cities... places of major intellectual and economic importance.

Now, I don’t know what constitutes as “Best” comments, but I assume that it’s just comments with a ton of upvotes.\n\nThe only way to get a sound comparison and a variety of viewpoints, is by sorting by “controversial”, but then one is at risk of seeing **** opinions and stuff.\n\nPeople are missing out on **all** of the opinions and posts by just sorting through “hot” when viewing subreddits, because these controversial posts and comments break the “mold” that is the public opinion.

It was a soulless corporate cash grab like every other Disney live action remake. And here in lies the REAL problem with modern media. The big Hollywood executives aren’t interested in art they are interested in profit margins and so what they want is to mass produce blockbusters. So they’ve made a formula but it’s lacking something a secret ingredient. They’ve wokeness is just something they’re trying to see if it’s the secret ingredient and when they finally figure out it’s not they’ll go looking for a new ingredient. They’ll probably try AI next and those movies will suck even harder. But here’s the thing the ingredient they are looking for doesn’t exist. You can’t mass produce great movies. You need to put in the effort to make movies great it’s a craft not something that can be mass produced and retain value. The video game TV and  comic book industry’s are doing the same thing trying to complete a formula by finding a secret ingredient that doesn’t exist. ", "authorship": "human"}

While I am grateful for many things that the internet has provided, life was better pre-social media in so many ways.  Just in the past few minutes of random browsing here on reddit, I came across 2 posts that cut to the core of my thoughts and feelings in it.  One was \"name one annoying thing that people base their entire identity around\" and another was \"here is a specific thing that some people base their entire identity around, and why I hate it\".  This whole thing with identity and ego.  Social media amplifies this problem where you only feel good about yourself when others \"like\" you, but then there is the question of who even ARE you... which most people answer by stating things that they \"like\" e.g., crossfit, gender identity, being a childless woman, being a trad wife.  It's all so asinine.  This is not how we should be defining ourselves.  Or rather, I'd argue that we should in fact STOP being so obsessed with defining ourselves, and get to work defining how we want to treat each other, and what kind of a world we want to live in.  \n\nWhen you spend time with other humans offline, as we all used to, there is no longer this pressing need to define yourself by what you \"like\", no longer this pressing need to define your personality \"type\" in relation to others.  In-person interactions (and phone calls kids! phone calls!) leave room for nuance, grey areas, perspective shifting, and the ability to be so much more than a one-dimensional representation with entertaining \"soundbites\".  \n\nAll that said, my particular \"social media identity peeve\" is the people making the self-help posts about being your \"authentic self\".  LOL.  It reminds me of when \"alternative\" music became mainstream.  They are making \"anti-social media\" the identity that they are using to generate their likes on social media.  And then here I am, on social media, hate-posting about the people who define themselves in opposition to the very things that I hate about social media simply because they are using social media to generate likes.

A household is not a home for animals, as the captivity limits their natural behavior and places both their mental and physical well-being at risk.\n\nThink about it.

The app trains us to crave quick dopamine hits, shortening attention spans and replacing depth with fleeting, algorithm-driven trends.

Maybe a ban isn’t such a bad thing—it might force us to detox and reclaim our ability to focus on things that truly matter. Sometimes, the healthiest choice is stepping away, even if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOn the free speech angle:\nThe First Amendment guarantees that “Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech.” This provision is directed at government actions that suppress speech based on its content or viewpoint. However, the focus of a TikTok ban rest on national security and data privacy concerns, rather than the regulation of specific speech or ideas.\n\nIf the government can demonstrate that such a ban is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest—such as protecting sensitive user data from foreign surveillance—it may survive constitutional scrutiny under legal doctrines like the \"strict scrutiny test.\" Importantly, the ban would target the platform itself as a mechanism of data collection, not the content being shared on it. A ban on TikTok would not inherently prevent individuals from expressing themselves; it would merely restrict the use of a specific medium which qualify as a foreign government interaction via social media. The courts have long held that the government has the authority to regulate certain platforms or channels under specific conditions, provided alternative avenues for speech remain available.

The true godfather of Modern Conservatism is not Donald Trump, not even Steve Bannon and even Stephen Miller. It's Newt Gingrich.\n\nYes, many say that Gingrich started the division culture and that Gingrich is the one who started the republican tradition of \"own the libs\", the tribalism, the bloody battles and the division..

By spending more than we can afford, sacrificing conservative values for the sake of easy answers, and electing the most liberal president ever, America is at risk for its very survival. The Obama administration is conspiring to transform our America of free enterprise, faith, and personal freedom into their America of endless bureaucracy, secularism, and state control—despite overwhelming opposition from the American people. “Our federal government is broken,” Gingrich states, “we must ‘replace, not reform’ our leaders and our policies.”\n\nJust read it!

{"Article Number": 242, "title": "Infant Circumcision is Unnecessary and Harmful", "article": "A key component of ethical healthcare is the patient’s informed consent. Because a child is not legally competent to consent to a surgery, it is the parent’s responsibility to give or withhold consent by proxy. However, this responsibility does not mean that the parent has *carte blanche* to consent to anything they like. Forcing a permanent body modification on the body of another person is not a valid moral decision if the modification is not medically necessary. And yet, the most common body modification done in the United States–infant circumcision–comes nowhere near being necessary. Many of the reasons given in defense of infant circumcision are flawed. For example:\n\n*Circumcision lowers the risk of urinary tract infection in infants.* In fact, circumcised babies are [just as likely](https://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/mueller/) to contract UTI as intact babies.\n\n*It eliminates the risk of penile cancer.* Circumcised men can still get penile cancer. [One study](https://cdn.mdedge.com/files/s3fs-public/jfp-archived-issues/1997-volume_44-45/JFP_1997-04_v44_i4_carcinoma-in-situ-of-the-penis-in-a-76-y.pdf) in 1997 noted that Denmark, in which 1.6% of men were circumcised, had a lower rate of penile cancer than the USA, in which 60% to 80% of men were circumcised. \n\n*It lowers the risk of HIV.* If this were true, one would expect non-circumcising Denmark to have a higher HIV rate than the USA; instead, the opposite is the case. In 2022, there were 11.3 new HIV infections per 100,000 people in the [USA](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20there%20were%2031%2C800%20estimated%20new%20HIV,and%2087%25%20of%20estimated%20infections%20among%20all%20males.) compared to 1.9 per 100,000 in [Denmark](https://en.ssi.dk/surveillance-and-preparedness/surveillance-in-denmark/annual-reports-on-disease-incidence/hiv-2022). The HIV-prevention myth originates from three studies that were done in Africa and were riddled with [methodological problems](https://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Birx-letter-WHO-HIV-PEPFAR-circumcision-06-29-20.pdf). The conclusions of the African studies have also been disproved by a recent Canadian study of over half a million males in Ontario, which found that there is [no correlation](https://www.auajournals.org/doi/10.1097/JU.0000000000002234) between circumcision status and risk of HIV.\n\n*It can sometimes be necessary to treat phimosis.* A tight foreskin, also known as phimosis, is normal and natural in newborns, because the foreskin is fused to the glans. The foreskin usually loosens and retracts on its own by adolescence. If not, phimosis is easily treatable with plastic phimosis rings, which gently stretch the skin over the course of a few months.\n\n*A circumcised penis is cleaner than an intact penis.* Like any other body part, a foreskin will be clean if it is washed. The hygiene claim has no relevance for people who take showers.\n\n*A circumcised penis is aesthetic.* Since aesthetic appearance is a matter of personal preference, not of medical necessity, it ought to be left to the owner of the penis, when he is old enough to decide for himself.\n\n*A circumcised penis is still functional.* This is true in the sense that a circumcised penis can achieve erection and ejaculation, but there is more to sex than being able to reproduce. The penis is a sensory organ; losing part of it will entail a loss of sensory function.\n\nInfant circumcision is bad for the baby, and for the man he will become. Its harms include the following:\n\n–The infant’s suffering both during and after the surgery, which is [traumatizing](https://www.cirp.org/library/psych/goldman1/).\n\n–Loss of erogenous [nerve endings](https://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/for-professionals/sexual-impact/).\n\n–Loss of the natural gliding motion of the foreskin over the glans during sex, causing friction and vaginal dryness.\n\n–Loss of the protective cover which keeps the glans moist, soft, and sensitive. In a circumcised penis, the glans becomes dried out and keratinized, and loses most of its [erogenous sensitivity](https://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06685.x).\n\nThe medical profession has been aware of the sexual functions of the foreskin for a long time. In fact, infant circumcision is a fossil of nineteenth-century anti-masturbation pseudo-science. In the 1870s, certain American doctors began to speculate that masturbation was the underlying cause of all sorts of maladies—syphilis, paralysis, tuberculosis, and epilepsy, to name a few. Because the foreskin is densely packed with erogenous nerve endings, these doctors knew that its excision would reduce sexual sensitivity. In 1901, Dr. E.G. Mark [wrote](http://www.noharmm.org/docswords.htm) in American Practitioner and News:\n\n\"Pleasurable sensations are elicited from the extremely sensitive mucous membrane [of the foreskin], with resultant manipulation and masturbation. The exposure of the glans penis following circumcision … lessens the sensitiveness of the organ. It therefore lies with the physicians, the family adviser in affairs hygienic and medical, to urge its acceptance.\"\n\nPut differently, it was their intention to diminish sexual sensation. That is why infant circumcision became standard practice in the United States. Modern claims that it has no impact on male sexual health are either ill-informed or disingenuous.\n\nIn other developed countries, doctors advise against infant circumcision. For example, the Royal Dutch Medical Association [states](https://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/knmg-non-therapeutic-circumcision-of-male-minors-27-05-2010.pdf) that “there is no convincing evidence that circumcision is useful or necessary in terms of prevention or hygiene.” By contrast, the United States has a for-profit medical industry, which recommends infant circumcision because it is profitable. Hospitals make money from circumcisions, then sell the foreskins to companies that harvest the keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which are used to make skin substitutes such as [Apligraf](https://apligraf.com/pdf/Apligraf-FactSheet.pdf). As long as there is a profit incentive for the American medical industry to harvest babies’ foreskins, it will continue to push the procedure on parents who don’t know any better.\n\nWhy is this a taboo topic? Circumcised men do not want to admit that their penises are missing something, because it feels emasculating. Parents do not want to admit that they allowed their sons to be harmed. Doctors do not want to admit that they have harmed baby boys. There is a general unwillingness to face uncomfortable facts.\n\nInfant circumcision is a needless surgery on a perfectly healthy baby, designed to destroy a functional, healthy part of his penis. Attempts to justify it rest upon the conceit that half of the human race requires immediate surgical alteration at birth. Because it is unnecessary and harmful, it is also indefensible.", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 251, "title": "Plenty of prostitutes are in the business because they like it. ", "article": "When you mention prostitution here on Reddit, you will instantly be bombarded by a crowd of angry people who claim that all women in prostitution are being exploited and either do it because they are forced to or because they have no way out. And that to a woman being paid for sex by a man just feels like being violated. \n\nI've in the past visited my fair share of prostitutes and erotic massage places. And frankly I have never had this experience. I remember the first time I visited a prostitute. It was a middle aged woman, living in a large house in a posh village with expensive cars in their driveway. Her husband had his own business, her kids were in college. She simply enjoyed the thrill of being a typical suburban housewife by day, while secretly being a prostitute by night. \n\nAnd those types I've seen more often. It should be said they are not the 21 year old Asian women with the tight body, but usually 40+ housewives and often a bit overweight. Their motives can be; \n\n\\- Just having a very liberal mentality towards sex with strangers and seeing it as an easy way to make a living (or an extra income). \n\n\\- Being into specific fetishes. Especially in the BDSM scene or when their partner is a cuck who liked to watch (or sometimes the husband might join). \n\n\\- Sometimes, simply being paid for sex is the fetish. \n\nAnother example would be an erotic masseuse I really liked to visit because she is very good at her job. She told me that when she came to the Netherlands, she first worked in a warehouse for 9 hours a day doing harsh physical labor and was very depressed. She finds live as an erotic massage therapist much more relaxed plus one client for 1 hour a day is enough for her to get by so she has a lot of free time. \n\nA final example was a 26 year old college student, to who being paid for sex seemed to be a bucketlist thing she wanted to try. She was very exited and actually responded genuinely disappointed when I declined a blowjob for instance. \n\nSure, I admit that I'm cherry picking here, and these are not the majority of all prostitutes. But they do exist. And when you know how to look for them, I guarantee you they offer you a much more high quality experience, with the added benefit that in the end you know both of you enjoyed it and you didn't take advantage of anyone.

{"Article Number": 252, "title": "Accepting Unattractiveness Is Like Death for a Woman", "article": "\nAdmitting you’re unattractive feels as taboo as discussing death because it forces people to confront uncomfortable truths they’d rather avoid. Society clings to platitudes like “Everyone is beautiful,” just as people use clichés to comfort the grieving, leaving no space for honest discussion.\n\nIt’s awkward because no one knows how to respond—agreeing feels cruel, but denying it feels fake. Saying you’re unattractive also exposes a vulnerability most people hide, making others confront their own insecurities about beauty. Ultimately, it feels like a social death, a loss of status and power, which society prefers to ignore rather than address.\n\n\n\nThe Stages of Grief in Accepting Unattractiveness:\n\n1. Denial\n\nAt first, you might convince yourself that beauty doesn’t matter. You tell yourself, \"It’s what’s inside that counts,\" even as the world screams otherwise. You cling to the hope that your personality, intelligence, or kindness will somehow override societal standards. Some women even fall into the \"i can't be ugly. it's because of sexism, racism, beauty standards, white people, bullies, colorist ect.\" \"It's not me, it's them\".\n\n2. Anger\n\nThis is where you confront the brutal truth: people are shallow, and the world revolves around appearances. The anger stems from cognitive dissonance—the clash between the belief that \"it’s what’s inside that counts\" and the reality that society values beauty above all else.\n\nYou’re enraged by the betrayal of ideals you grew up believing, like kindness or intelligence mattering more than looks. Watching beautiful people receive opportunities, admiration, and love while you’re overlooked feels like a slap in the face.\n\n3. Bargaining\n\nthis stage is about bargaining with reality: If I work hard enough, people will finally see me as beautiful. You think with enough effort, you can escape the prison of unattractiveness. You convince yourself that self-improvement is the key to acceptance, admiration, and love. \"Maybe it's not my looks. I just need a new hairstyle or get contact lenses\" Maybe you dive into makeup tutorials, lose weight, or overhaul your wardrobe, thinking that if you just try hard enough, you can \"fix\" yourself. You pray for a glow-up as though it’s a divine intervention, a miracle that will transform your life overnight. The pain of this stage comes from realizing that no amount of effort can guarantee the validation you’re seeking.\n\n4. Depression\n\nIn this stage, the hopelessness becomes overwhelming as you realize no amount of effort can change how society perceives you. You feel invisible, overlooked in both social and professional spaces, and lonely, disconnected from a world that seems to value beauty above all else.\n\nShame sets in, as society’s standards make you believe your appearance is a personal failing. Comparisons with others—especially on social media—fuel bitterness and self-loathing. You withdraw, avoiding situations where you feel judged or ignored, and question your worth, wondering if life will always feel this empty.\n\n5. Acceptance: The Hardest Thing a Woman Can Do In Her Life\n\nAcceptance is the most challenging stage because it requires rejecting the lifelong conditioning that ties a woman’s worth to her beauty. It means letting go of societal validation, knowing you may never receive the attention or admiration beauty affords, and instead defining your value on your own terms.\n\nYou stop chasing the beauty rat race—no more endless diets, makeup routines, or comparisons—and focus on what truly fulfills you, like your skills, relationships, and personal growth. It’s not easy; the world constantly reminds you of its obsession with appearance, and acceptance can feel isolating.\n\nBut it’s also freeing. Acceptance allows you to reclaim your identity, live authentically, and detach your worth from a shallow system. Though the pain of unfairness lingers, stepping off the hamster wheel of validation is a radical act of self-liberation.", "authorship": "human"}

People who try to make the counter argument have various ways of trying to weasel out of this basic fact.\n\nFirst off, they try to paint having that many options as a disadvantage. They try to say that now they have to sift and find the good ones. I'm not saying sifting is always easy but it's much easier than having limited options.\n\nSecondly, a lot of people say it's harder because women run the risk of pregnancy. This seems valid but crumbles very quickly. First off, every form of invisible contraception is tailored for women. Every. single. one.\n\nSo, if a woman doesn't want to be pregnant, she can just use birth control. It really isn't that difficult. Or if that fails, she can get on a flight to the West Coast or Northeast and essentially pay for not being pregnant. No, I don't think women should have to travel like this at all, but they have this option. Men can't unilaterally book a trip to Seattle, Baltimore, or Chicago to escape a pregnancy. So, if anything, pregnancy potential is more of a disadvantage to the man who can't control what happens after.\n\nIt's very clear that women have the advantage. If a man wants to date, he has to hit the gym massively and get his money way up. Not bad things for sure, but a very high bar.\n\nOh, and also, he better hope he has good looks because if he's under 5'6 or has other bad looks he's SOL even if he does the above. Ask me how I know about the height disadvantage. I've LIVED it.\n\nWomen on the other hand don't need to do anything. If she exists, she will have options approach her.

I love cats but I belief domesticated  pet cats they should be mostly indoor just like dogs, however at least they are somewhat domesticated even though they still are likely causing harm to wildlife when let outside... I think feral cats should have been included in the predator free 2025 goal. The biggest issue is actually wild, grouchy, wild feral cats that breed relentlessly. No one owns these cats, they rely basically solely on the wildlife population for sustenance and there are many of them roaming free in New Zealand.   \n  \nNZ is trying to rejuvenate the population count of wildlife that evolved without cats. They are a apex predator and flightless birds are particularly susceptible as they cannot fly away or defend themselves. NZ should have a program to reduce wild cats populations and encourage domestic cats to be mostly kept indoors. Unlike other countries, there is no other predator to minimise or balance feral cats population, otherwise this may not be as big of an issue. Their population is getting out of control and unfortunately neutering wouldn't work super well as they may not be able to breed but they can still hurt bird populations. It is hard to minimise a population of something like this as they remind us so much of our fur babies and loved pets.  I have owned and looked after many pets in my life, including domestic cats that live mostly outside (which I may or may not have owned). My opinion comes after considering the topic for over 10 years and the delicate nature of NZ's wildlife. Domesticated dogs would never be allowed to roam free in modern day without risking it getting taken to the vets, SPCA or getting potentially put down by a local farmer trying to protect their stock (potentially). Again, I love cats and enjoy their company but I am also all for growing NZ's native wildlife populations, being as at risk as they already are thus far. There already is a similar program and incentive for wild possums, unlike in Australia where they are protected.\n\nPerhaps wildlife conservationists should start with managing populations of feral cats in NZ's public reserves first, where native birds are most likely to prosper and islands :) Then work their way into more populated areas?

", "article": "I love JP and I conclude that after listening to him on his podcast or youtube I do often have to stop, rewind, and listen to what he said again to understand what he means. He does use a lot of big words. But if you claim that he just makes nonsense statements and compare him to Deepak Chopra, you probably have a gap in your understanding of different belief systems. \n\nPeterson’s framework for understanding the world is rooted in a combination of evolutionary psychology, archetypal narratives, and a Christian moral outlook. People who approach these topics from a different framework—such as postmodernism, social constructivism, or purely empirical science—may find his arguments alien or difficult to grasp. Although he does dodge the question of God, he basically starts from the perspective that God exists, or at least that objective morality exists. I think a lot of the confusion about his statements starts from there. I was raised Christian (still am, but was raised that way too), but I think if you're not really familiar with the Christian worldview, or at least an Abrahamic one, which isn't materialist, that's a stumbling block for many to understanding what he's talking about. \n\nHis ideas often also leave room for interpretation, which can lead to misunderstandings. For example, his discussions on hierarchies, order vs. chaos, and the importance of traditional structures can be interpreted in vastly different ways, depending on your perspective. What I've found with people who find him hard to understand or hate him is that he takes the perspective that hierarchies are necessary, in the sense that they will always exist because they are a part of nature, as an attempted justification of the hierarchies exactly as they are now. Peterson's definitely a conservative, but most of his work is about how we can't get rid of hierarchies in general, not that hierarchies should never be altered. \n\nIt's also true that when he talks, even about a simple question, he often starts talking about things in multiple disciplines, linking psychology to sociology, biology, and literature too (guy loves Russian literature and the Bible). This makes his arguments complex, layered arguments that require listeners to follow long trains of thought. This can be difficult if you want a simple answer, which is frustrating for even me (like you talk about God all the time Jordan, how can you possibly tell people you don't know what they mean when they ask you if you believe in Him?), but it doesn't mean he's full of shit. It makes him a university professor (try reading Lacan if you want a hard read). He deals with questions at a very deep level. \n\nBasically, you can call him totally wrong and evil if you want, I don't care that much. He's not me. But it's not like he makes no sense. I think people who think he makes no sense just want a really quick, snarky answer, and that's not always the right way to be.

Canadians have this inferiority complex that is despicable to me. Actively finding flaws in their southern neighbors, but turning a blind eye to their own.

Like the arts industry, tech, aviation, finances...even successful Canadian actors and singers wind up living in California. The Canadian economy has been stagnating at around 2 trillion. 4 years ago, the US economy was at 21 trillion. Now, it's 27 and growing fast. Plus, salaries are higher in some industries and cost of living is lower in most parts of the US excluding the top famous cities. In addition, Canadians who would like to avoid the cold such as the snowbirds, they now would have unlimited time to stay in Florida without restrictions set by immigration law.\n\nThe only downsides are healthcare and safety. But healthcare is context-dependent and a lot of Canadians assume Americans pay out of pocket which is pretty ignorant, but they'll eventually figure it out. Most people have insurance for themselves so we should learn the concept of self reliance instead of demanding freebies. Healthcare should be free only for those who can't take care of themselves due to extraordinary circumstances such being mentally disabled. But for the majority, they just have to treat it like dental insurance. It's not a significant impact really plus you get perks of privatized healthcare including short wait times and access to experimental futuristic treatments if you really want to pay for it. The current system of banning health insurance is ridiculous. Healthcare in the US functionally has the right idea. It's just the costs, but that can be solved. Finally for guns, that's controversial because a proportion of Canadians were not happy with Trudeau's actions of banning guns from law-abiding citizens in response to criminals who obtained their guns illegally. As for shootings and crime, they're mostly done by poor people. It's highly unlikely they have the finances to move up north and stir trouble if the border is removed.

{"Article Number": 316, "title": "The Truth Behind the Manipulation: A Call to Wake Up and Stand Together", "article": "We are living in a time where the truth is increasingly difficult to find, not because it’s hidden, but because the very institutions meant to inform us are the ones manipulating the narratives we’re fed. It’s time we wake up to the reality of what’s happening around us, not just in our country, but globally. The media and our government have been controlling the story for far too long, and we’ve let it happen by failing to question, by failing to critically analyze what we’re told.\n\nThe History of Propaganda and Manipulation\n\nThe manipulation we’re witnessing today isn’t new. In fact, it’s been happening for centuries. Take, for example, the story we were all taught about Christopher Columbus. We were told that he “discovered” America, that he was a brave explorer seeking new lands. But the truth is much darker. Columbus’s arrival marked the beginning of the genocide of indigenous people and the pillaging of their land. The narrative that we were fed in school was crafted to justify the horrors of colonization and to sanitize the violence and exploitation that followed. It’s a narrative that erases the real history and hides the atrocities committed in the name of expansion. The idea that we “discovered” land that was already inhabited is a complete distortion of reality and one of the oldest propaganda tactics used to maintain power and control.\n\nAnd this type of manipulation didn’t stop there. In the U.S., during World War II, the government created the Office of Wartime Information, which produced propaganda to shape how we saw the Japanese and other nations. This is the same tactic we’ve seen throughout history: an external enemy is created and exaggerated to maintain control. And this doesn’t end there. When we look at the Holocaust, it’s essential to acknowledge that there’s only one true German viewpoint documentary on the war. The rest are heavily shaped by the perspectives of the Allied forces, mainly the U.S. This isn’t to diminish the tragedy of the Holocaust, but rather to remind us that history itself can be bent to fit a narrative—and not always the one we’ve been taught.\n\nThe New Orleans Situation: Manipulation at Its Finest\n\nOne of the most recent and deeply troubling examples of media manipulation came with the tragic attack in New Orleans on New Year’s Day. A man, allegedly connected to ISIS, drove a truck into a crowd of people, killing 14. Following the attack, the FBI raided his home. The next day, New York Post reporter, Jennie Taer , was allowed to walk freely through the crime scene, which was disturbingly pristine, showing an organized bookshelf, an open Quran, a prayer rug, and a pair of shoes placed in front of them.\n\nThis alone raised numerous red flags. It didn’t take long for people to see through this blatant manipulation. The man’s home appeared meticulously staged, almost as though someone wanted to paint a picture of the attack that fit a specific narrative—one that would once again fuel anti-Muslim sentiment. In every comment section I’ve read, not one person believes this attack wasn’t staged or manipulated in some way. This is a clear example of how our government and media can engineer public perception, and it’s time we start questioning the motives behind it.\n\nMainstream Media Today: The Scripted Reality\n\nFast forward to today, and it’s clearer than ever that the media operates on a script. Have you ever noticed that no matter which news outlet you turn to, the stories are almost identical? The same talking points, the same wording, often in sync across major news stations. This is no accident. It’s the result of a controlled narrative that’s carefully curated and distributed by those in power. The media isn’t here to inform us; they’re here to shape our views, divide us, and ultimately keep us in a state of fear and confusion. This is how they keep us from seeing the bigger picture, how they distract us from the reality of our collective power.\n\nThe Role of TikTok and Censorship\n\nOne of the most glaring examples of this manipulation today is the growing push to ban TikTok in the U.S. Since its rise, TikTok has become a platform for the free exchange of ideas, knowledge, and perspectives—things the mainstream media can’t control. It’s allowed us to see behind the curtains of government and corporate control, to hear from people outside of the narrative they’ve built. And that’s why the powers that be are threatened. They don’t want us to connect with each other, to share information that challenges their narrative. They want us in the dark, dependent on their controlled media outlets to tell us what’s real.\n\nTikTok may have its fair share of misinformation, but that’s a problem we can address with critical thinking and discernment. The solution isn’t to censor it, but to encourage education and media literacy. Banning TikTok is about silencing the voices that don’t fit the narrative—voices that are challenging the status quo.\n\nPalestine and Israel: A Reflection on Our Own History\n\nThe ongoing conflict between Palestine and Israel has its own roots in territorial disputes, much like the colonial mindset that has plagued the world for centuries. But here’s the part that makes me question the role of the U.S. in supporting either side: Imagine if the roles were reversed. Imagine if, as Americans, we decided to go back to Europe and reclaim the land our ancestors once occupied simply because we feel entitled to it. We wouldn’t be well-received, and rightfully so. Just because our ancestors came from there doesn’t mean we have any rightful claim to that land now, and we’d likely be met with resistance if we tried to impose ourselves on that land.\n\nSo why are we getting involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Shouldn’t we be striving for peace and unity, not taking sides in a conflict that has nothing to do with us? We, as a nation, should be the ones leading efforts for peaceful resolution between all nations—not taking sides in conflicts that are far older and more complex than we could ever understand. Our interference in such matters only fuels further division and hatred. We should be working toward solutions that benefit humanity as a whole, not pushing one group over another. Our involvement should be focused on creating bridges, not building walls.\n\nCall to Action: Unity, Love, and Peace\n\nWe are at a crossroads. We have been manipulated, divided, and led to believe that we are powerless in the face of the powers that control us. But the truth is, if we came together—if we united in love, understanding, and peace—we would be an unstoppable force. It’s not about overthrowing anyone, but about reclaiming our collective power and creating a society where everyone, not just the elite few, has the chance to thrive.\n\nSo, I ask you: let’s wake up. Let’s stop accepting the narratives that are being fed to us. Let’s question what we’re told, challenge the systems of control, and work together to build a world that is based on truth, love, and understanding—not fear and division.??", "authorship": "human"}

That they owe it to society. But, I think that billionaires should give less to charity and spend more of it on high-impact businesses.\n\nWhat do I mean by this? Great examples are Tesla and SpaceX. Tesla, as a private corporation, has captured a large share of the global EV market. SpaceX, as a private corporation, is way ahead of any private or government entity in terms of launch price and capability. And these amazing things were accomplished without charitable donations, and they also supply thousands of jobs (OK, OK, I know you are about to open your mouths to argue about this, but just consider that charity by itself probably would not have been able to accomplish this).\n\nAnother example I like to use is diabetes.

Add to that numerous research labs (some academic, some corporate) that are all busy attacking various problems. But so much of this is just nibbling around the edges! I feel like nobody has really tried to attack the problem directly, such as with tissue regeneration. They've done it in mice. Why not just spend 50 billion dollars on some method that could directly cure the disease? I guarantee you that the first billionaire to create a company for this problem and solve it would become the first trillioniare. And probably get a horse's head in his bed. Again, you can argue with this point, but I think you get the idea.\n\nIn summary, I think the profit motive is a great way for billionaires to spend money, since they have the money to achieve escape velocity in a lot of areas, can pursue many avenues that governments are not interested in, and can employ many people.

Hordes of leftists have taken to twitter in their thousands to mock his death, posting memes/jokes and the like. This isn't there first offense either, as they did the exact same thing with the Ocean Gate submarine on the basis that those who died where billionaires. They also responded in a similar manner after the Trump assassination attempt, in anger that the shooter missed. Which begs the question, why pretend to be edgy by clowning on someone's death when you yourself get triggered over anything remotely offensive?

Persecution of Jews in Germany was legal. Marital rape was legal in most places until the late 20th Century and still is in some places). Secondly, many of the situations that result in the retort \"their house their rules\" are describing illegal situations, such as abuse via social or emotional neglect, or coercive control (in British legislation since 2015). Thirdly, even in cases where it's not clearly against the law based on the limited information given, people who use this phrase don't make any effort to first ascertain if the situation is part of a wider pattern which is against the law. All of this indicates they aren't really bothered about the legality of the situation and are only bothered about compliance with the dictum of \"my house my rules\".\n\nBased on your own words (don't deny it, take responsibility for what comes from your own mouth), you also believe that children do not have a right to a home until they're in an economic situation to live alone. So in the interest of consistency, you should also never ask children or adults living with their parents/guardians what they do at home - you should now only ask them \"what do you do in your parent's home?\"\n\nYou also do not believe in conflict resolution or attempting to negotiate compromises, if your primary response is \"their house their rules, move out if you don't like it\" to people without basic personal freedoms. Which makes you generally poor at interpersonal relationships.\n\nFurthermore, if your parents were/are so lenient that their version of \"their house their rules\" (the rule you yourself believe as gospel) allowed you to do normal things like seeing friends/family, going outdoors, going shopping, choosing clothes, cooking, having your own phone and ID, using the internet, having ordinary hobbies, making noise on floorboards etc - you should also admit to yourself and to others that you're a privileged and spoilt individual who had a privileged and spoilt beginning to your life.

{"Article Number": 365, "title": "AI might soon kill us all and nobody cares", "article": "I believe we are quite close to achieving superintelligent AI. My longest likely timeline is something on the order of 10 years. My shortest likely timeline is as little as 2 years. In any case, it seems like we are not many conceptual insights away from an AI that can automate remote work at superhuman quality and speed. This would imply that it is close to automating AI research and development itself, which is very likely to kick off a process of self-improving AI systems that rapidly get themselves to levels of intelligence that can only be described as god-like to us. It should be obvious why that is threatening. \n\nI say this because the latest models are getting impressively good scores on tests of mathematics at the highest levels and performing some abstract reasoning tasks at near-human performance (OpenAI's o3 model with the FrontierMath and ARC-AGI tests). It was only one year ago when AI models would get nearly no questions right of the types that appear on these tests. As far as those of us who do not work in a frontier AI lab can tell, it took just one conceptual insight to get AI to this level, something called chain-of-thought, the details of which are outside the scope of this post. This single technique took AI models from being mere statistical token-predictors to doing something that resembles actual reasoning. \n\nThe bleeding-edge models of today are, of course, still limited. They require extraordinary amounts of energy, are not capable of carrying out longer-term tasks, and are inferior to humans at certain kinds of reasoning. But just as one insight took AI from near-zero reasoning ability to non-trivially greater-than-zero reasoning ability, it may not take many additional insights to fix these issues. Heck, we may already have all the insights we need and just need to scale up models. After all, the difference between our brains and those of chimpanzees is not that they fundamentally differ in the kind of processing they do. We just have way more neural synapses. \n\nThe problem with rushing ahead with AI capabilities to the extent that tech companies have been is that we have no idea how to make it value keeping us alive, happy, and free. If it does not value those things, then there is a very good chance of a bad outcome when it gets to superhuman capability. If it does not care about our existence, then what would stop it from killing us in the pursuit of the things that it actually does care about? For example, why would it not boil away the Earth's oceans to power the fusion reactors that provide the energy it uses? Do not get caught up on that specific scenario. It is just meant to illustrate the basic concept. Until this problem is solved, we should not attempt to improve AI capability beyond where they are now.\n\nIt greatly frustrates me that there is no political or social will to address this issue. The government seems perfectly content with letting tech companies continue their reckless AI development. It should instead ban them from continuing this research and work on an international treaty to enforce the ban abroad, but it does not seem interested in pursuing that. If we had any hope at all, much of it was lost with the election of Trump, as he is right in the pockets of the technologists who run these companies. As for the technologists themselves, they have deluded themselves into buying into various specific scenarios for how we can make it through this alive. But these beliefs are a result of rationalizing their preferred conclusion of achieving superhuman AI while avoiding AI catastrophe than any actual forward reasoning from the underlying principles governing intelligent systems. Furthermore, much of the electorate seems blissfully unaware of where AI is headed and therefore could not care less, instead choosing to focus on more transient issues. Oh well, what can you do?

However, I am disgusted at how modern atheism has become a toxic anti-religion echo chamber online by a large minority of radicalised vocal individuals.\n\nWikipedia defines religion as \"*range of social-cultural systems, including designated behaviors and practices, morals, beliefs, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that generally relate humanity to supernatural, transcendental, and spiritual elements—although there is no scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a religion*\".\n\nTherefore, I argue that pure atheism is a standardised, stringent set of systems, behaviours, and practices that purely originate from personal conviction and worldviews. It must not originate from reactionary opposition to religious belief, nor should it be defined by the hostility that some radicalised atheists express toward religious communities. Instead, atheism in its purest form should be understood as a philosophical stance on the lack of an existence of a higher power, reached through individual reflection, not groupthink or tribalism.\n\nAtheism should not become, paradoxically, a quasi-religion of anti-religion. When atheism adopts a rigid orthodoxy of hostility toward belief, it risks becoming the very thing it seeks to oppose: an ideological system rooted in dogma and intolerance. True atheism, I believe, should not concern itself with tearing down religious traditions but instead focus on affirming a worldview based on secular ethics and rational intellectual inquiry.\n\nMany online atheist communities, particularly on certain subreddits, focus excessively on mocking the worst aspects of religion without offering a thoughtful, purist atheist perspective. Instead of exploring secular ethics or existential meaning, they reduce atheism to reactionary ridicule, turning it into a shallow opposition rather than a meaningful worldview. Members of these communities often perpetuate a bleak life-outlook of helplessness, depression, and a void of meaning, when in truth, pure atheism can offer just as much purpose, fulfillment, and moral clarity as religion.\n\nIn short, atheism should be a personal conclusion, not a crusade.\n\nTLDR: Atheism should be a personal conclusion, not an anti-religion crusade.

I think that this misunderstanding is a product of college sexual assault briefings, which cause people to blur the lines between a legal and moral conception of consent.\n\nPeople seem to not get that there's a difference between legal intoxication (or too drunk to drive) and being incapacitated. You can consent to almost anything with a BAC of 0.08 from a legal standpoint. If you are able to walk around, you can probably consent. Additionally, there is a difference between voluntary and involuntary intoxication. An adult should know that consuming an intoxicant will make them drunk.\n\nI believe that colleges do everyone a disservice by not offering some kind of disclaimer by saying that someone who has consumed alcohol is unable to give consent, because that standard has no teeth outside of the institution's policies and probably causes people to take more risky behaviors than they would otherwise.", "authorship": "human"}

I hate how slow travel is labeled as a virtue. The idea of staying in one place for weeks at a time assumes you have the resources to do so. For those on tight budgets or with limited time off, slow travel just isn't worth it.\n\nI travel when I get bored of my day to day life, and I travel to see what I want to see. By the end of my trip, I want to feel exhausted and be able to ponder what the fuck just happened for weeks on end. Travelling is almost always more expensive than not travelling - so taking one's sweet time, sleeping in and \"soaking in the destination\" is extremely inefficient. When you travel, you're paying more to be alive - so you should diversify your expenses. I hate sleeping at the same hotel for 2 nights, because you're paying double for the same experience. I hate eating at the same restaurant twice (while travelling), because no matter how good the food may be, you're paying double for a similar experience. Therefore, spending too much time in the same place is also a waste of money. Plus, most places in the world are just not interesting enough to warrant more than 1-2 days of intensive sightseeing. I have been bored out by some of the world's most lauded big cities, such as Los Angeles and Beijing, but also by some smaller destinations that backpackers spend weeks in - like Lake Atitlan - simply because I spent too much time in them.\n\nPeople say that rush trips are forgettable and that slow trips are more \"meaningful\" and \"memorable.\" On the contrary, I've found that cramming the absolute maximum amount of destinations into my limited vacation days at the lowest price possible actually makes a short amount of time feel longer. I have planned trips under this philosophy for the past 3 years and instantly stopped feeling bored. I'm headed off to Chile, Argentina and Brazil this summer (winter in SA) and have planned 1 day in Santiago, 1 day in Valparaiso, 1 day in Montevideo, 1 day in Colonia del Sacramento, 2 days in Buenos Aires, 1 day in Posadas/San Ignacio, 1 day at the Iguazu Falls, 1 day in Brasilia, 1 day in Salvador de Bahia, 1 day in Fortaleza, 2 days in Rio and 1 day in Sao Paulo. The sheer pace of the trip might look overwhelming but I find so much thrill in flying from city to city and sleeping in overnight buses every other day - at the absolute lowest cost possible, abusing long layovers, multi-city flight ticketing, and dirt cheap buses/trains.\n\nDon't get me wrong - wasting daylight hours on long buses and trains is a colossal waste of efficiency. But when you can dash from place to place while staying the minimum amount of time needed to see what you want to see, all the diverse experiences you have stack up, and you end up with more stories to tell.", "authorship": "human"}

From groceries to electronics everything is cheaper. A flat screen TV was a sign of wealth when I was a kid. Now they are so cheap people put them in their bathrooms. 30 years ago cellphones were a luxury item now they are not only standard but can do ridiculously more.\n\nThat's another thing. Our standard of living has gotten so high what was luxury 20 years ago is economy. Take your average car. Our current economy cars have navigation, power windows, power mirrors, back up cameras, Bluetooth radios, apple carplay and all that. You ever seen what cars where like even before that? My 96 is a manual and doesn't even have a techometer. I was talking to a guy a while back that had a 60's Camero.

My current car I've driven 40,000 miles and only had to do calipers. That didn't happen with 60's-80s cars or to a lesser extent 90's cars. \n\nEven with stuff that has gotten more expensive. Do realize how much bigger and better houses built in the modern age are? Just take a drive in bumfick no where and look at the size of the houses built in the 50's. A lot of y'all have apartments bigger than some of those houses.\n\n\nYes we have issues that need to be addressed. I even noted healthcare and housing for example. I'm just saying overall it's massively better today and we do not need a revolution. We can fix the problems we have peacefully. Hell the federal government has already been taken steps in the housing direction to make it more affordable.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention income has doubled since the 60's and the middle class is disappearing because so many people are joining the upper middle class.\n\nEdit 2: even with the housing issues we have right now home ownership is higher than most of US history. The peak was 2020 right before the housing crisis at 69% it's now 64%. To put that in perspective it was around 57% in the 50's. Even in that regard you are better off now than most of US history.

This is literally no different than people who become wealthy and now can afford the best things here in the US. \n\nI also notice that these people also don't tend to assimilate to the culture in those countries.

All dogs are protective and loyal.\n\nI appreciate the suggestion, however it is on the other side of one side of the family, I personally had no say in how the dogs were mated and even how the puppies got to be raised before we got my dog (till 8 weeks old) Maybe you should think twice before being a dick to somebody just because you disagree and your views don’t align with theirs.\n\nI have learned for many years how to diffuse tense situations, my dog has been attacked twice because he didn’t want to defend himself. There was another fight at the dog park (way before we stopped taking him there) when my dog was four months old and it was in the big dogs area. Two dogs were going at it and I was about ready to hop the large fence to help and break it up when others had already gotten there.\n\nThank you again for the suggestion, but I think I know plenty about dogs, how to stop breeding (as my own dog is not fixed, I don’t allow for situations like that to happen), I am always attentive and responsible because I have to be, and considering I own a Pitbull, I know a lot of what I’m talking about.\n\nAlso, don’t go uselessly assuming things about people, just from a small tidbit of information from their lives.", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 453, "title": "CANADIANS ONLY: Pierre Poilievre is going to be PM, and not only are you going to be fine, you're going to be better off than under Trudeau.", "article": "You can tell how close Poilievre is to being PM by how much Canadian reddit discussions focus on him. Now that Trudeau is screwed, and any replacements for him before an election has to be called are probably going to be Kim Campbelled, left-wing Reddit is focusing heavily on attacking him. These attacks are mostly not substantive, and this post includes a few reasons why. \n\n1. \"He has no policy/ only attacks Trudeau/ only has empty slogans!\"\n\nAs the Leader of Opposition, he doesn't have to put forth policy proposals. That isn't his job. His job is to hold the government to account. This, by nature, means that he will do more attacking the government than putting forth policy proposals. It also means he's going to do a lot of attacking Trudeau - that is his job. It's true, he's a lot more curt than other conservatives about doing it, and says mean words sometimes. This, in my view, is a good thing. Why should politics be about being nice all the time, especially when your opponent hates you, and your opponent has written the rules of engagement for the last hundred years? And considering Trudeau has done a remarkably shit job of being PM, it's good that he hits hard and plays a little dirty. Canada has had remarkably pussy-whipped conservatives for a while, and you should be thankful one of them has realized there's a market for being aggressive against a radlib Prime Minister.\n\nAlso, the slogans are working. \"Ax The Tax\" isn't the most complex piolicy proposal, but it's in your head, and you're talking about it. That's the point. Don't get mad about it, get mad that your guys aren't as good at branding. That's why Poilievre does them.\n\nAlso - he does have policy, it's just that it's not advantageous for him to reveal it now. That would make him the focus of the media cycle, and that would allow our radlib press to just deconstruct him rather than reporting on anything else.  But with that said, here's a list of policy proposals which will probably be a part of his campaign when the writ drops (sourced from ChatGPT, admittedly):\n\n**Economic Policy:**\n\n* **Balanced Budgets:** Introduce a \"pay-as-you-go\" law requiring the government to offset any new spending with equivalent cuts elsewhere to control deficits and combat inflation.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Bank of Canada Reforms:** Replace the Governor of the Bank of Canada, audit the institution, and prohibit the implementation of a central bank digital currency.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Cryptocurrency Adoption:** Promote the use of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, aiming to make Canada the \"blockchain capital of the world.\"[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Defunding the CBC:** Reduce government spending by defunding the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), except for its French-language

Canadians.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Housing and Infrastructure:**\n\n* **Increase Housing Supply:** Mandate major cities with unaffordable housing to boost new home construction by 15% annually, with federal infrastructure funding tied to these targets.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Utilize Federal Properties:** Sell 15% of under-utilized federal buildings to convert them into affordable housing units.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Airport Expansion:** Approve the expansion of the runway at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport to allow jet operations, enhancing competition in the aviation sector.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Environment and Energy:**\n\n* **Carbon Tax Repeal:** Eliminate the federal carbon tax, viewing it as detrimental to the economy.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Promote Green Technology:** Focus on technological solutions like carbon capture and storage to address climate change, rather than taxation.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Energy Independence:** Ban foreign oil imports and revisit previously canceled pipeline projects to boost domestic energy production.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Healthcare:**\n\n* **Support Public Healthcare:** Commit to maintaining Canada's public healthcare system.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Address Healthcare Shortages:** Implement interprovincial standardization for doctors and nurses through a \"Blue Seal\" program and expedite credential recognition for internationally trained health professionals.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Uphold Healthcare Funding:** Honor existing healthcare funding agreements with provinces, while advocating for increased funding.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Immigration:**\n\n* **Adjust Immigration Levels:** Link immigration numbers to housing availability and public service capacity, proposing reductions in asylum seekers and temporary residents to align with Canada's infrastructure.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Enhance Border Security:** Strengthen measures against illegal immigration, including amending the Safe Third Country Agreement and reinstating visa requirements for certain countries.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Social Issues:**\n\n* **Abortion Rights:** Support access to abortion services, pledging not to introduce or pass legislation that restricts this right, while allowing free votes on related matters.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Same-Sex Marriage:** Support same-sex marriage, acknowledging its success in Canada.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Drug Policy:** Oppose the decriminalization of hard drugs, advocating for increased treatment and recovery services for individuals with addictions, and propose legal action against pharmaceutical companies contributing to the opioid crisis.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Foreign Policy:**\n\n* **International Relations:** Criticize international organizations like the World Economic Forum, expressing opposition to their agendas, and propose banning ministers and top government officials from attending their annual summits. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Conservative_Party_of_Canada_leadership_election?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n  \n2. \"He's never had a job!\"\n\nThat would be a valid point if he were running against a party of people who had jobs. He is not. If you were willing to vote for Trudeau, who has nursed at the government teat his whole life, you cannot make this argument against voting for Poilievre.  And while government experience isn't ideal for a conservative, he's had a lot of cabinet positions.\n\n3. \"He's an extremist/He's a Nayzi!\"\n\nHe is not. The core of his campaign is getting rid of a tax. It's about as milquetoast of a conservative goal as you can get. \n\n4. \"He's gonna ban abortion!\"\n\nAbortion is pretty much Canada's second most sacred cow after healthcare. We made Mortengaler a member of the OOC. As sourced from ChatGPT, he won't personally touch abortion. I do concede that if he gets over 250 seats the Conservatives may have a free vote on some issue like banning late-term abortion and that may pass. That's as far as it's going to get. You're going to be able to kill as many babies for as long as you want.\n\n5. \"He's working for the oligarchs!\"\n\nThis is the best liberal point, and would be a good point if it weren't that the Liberals are also the oligarch party in Canada. In fact more so. Canada is basically a state of Oligarchs. Air Canada, the banks, the housing giants, the telecoms, the Irvings, the Westons; in Canada, these  groups and peopleare untouchable. I do think Poilievre will be better for the economy because he'll be better at reducing housing costs and forcing municipalities to build, and will probably reduce immigration at least somewhat, putting less strain on housing, but luckily  for him, he's running against an NDP which is regarded and the Liberals, who are the oligarchs. So this one's a wash. \n\nAnyways, even I am not super excited about him, but I'm not impressed because I think he isn't conservative enough, not because he is too conservative. I do think he's smarter and more competent than Trudeau, and I'm cautiously optimistic about him. Please discuss. ", "authorship": "human"}

Conservatively speaking, divide 44k by 0.04 as per the 4% 401k withdrawal rule, this is equivalent to a 1.1 million 401k savings. \n\nSure, your teachers will never get paid like a Google Software developer or your military field grade officers, but most people will love this pay/benefits for their jobs. \n\nNow, is the job difficult? Absolutely. But so is CDL, welding, plumbing, HVAC installation and those jobs are far more demanding physically. \n\nDoes the job require qualifications in degrees and intelligence? Sure, but I wager that mechanical/civil engineers, on average, are higher in test scores, GPA, and IQ score. Sure, you can always selectively compare STEM teachers to engineers, but I'm sorry, a math/physics degree simply isn't as marketable as any engineering ones. \n\nIs the job dangerous? Yes, it can be. But so are police, military, and mall cops.\n\nWhat I am saying is, is teaching a noble and tough profession? Absolutely. But are they underpaid? No. And the constant moaning and whining will only make the society disrespect them more when the rest of us cannot dream of a pension this generous with high job security. You can't expect the rest of us to pay even higher taxes to gift to teachers when we cannot afford our own groceries. \n\nSo teachers who feel they are underpaid should seek employment elsewhere, that is the beauty of capitalism.

These strategies are fairly trivial/easy to implement, however I doubt those within the lower percentile of IQ can deduce much of the aforementioned advice.

And unlike “trickle down economics” which doesn’t hold any water logically (the rich simply got richer period), by getting rid of illegal immigrants there is actual supply and demand forces to ensure the poorest U.S. citizens get their fair share in wages.

If the person didn't do those things it got around that they couldn't be trusted and they got a bad reputation. \n\nI feel like there isn't much emphasis put on being true to your word anymore. This has led to the culture of people ghosting, people flaking on plans, and people often saying they are going to do things when they have zero intention of doing them. This leads to a lack of trust all around that hurts society. One of the fundamental building blocks of building a cohesive society is trust. In a culture without trust people assume everyone has ill intent. \n\nI believe this started when cell phones became common. Before that if you made plans you felt obligated to carry through or the person would just be waiting for you without a way to contact you. Once cell phones became common it was easier to update people if you couldn't make it. This has slowly progressed to where we are today. \n\nI really think we need to start making it important to carry through with your word again. If you aren’t willing to do something don't say that you will do it. It really isn't that hard to be an honest person. I think this would help heal our society and bring people closer together.

{"Article Number": 497, "title": "Everyone should just tip as much or as little as they want and not feel guilty about it - servers are not entitled to tips", "article": "# Introduction\n\nIt is true that the wages of servers and waiters are usually extremely low. However, remember that people choose this work voluntarily. Any given waiter or server could have instead chosen a different profession and made a much more reasonable guaranteed wage, yet they have chosen not to. Why is that?\n\nThe opportunity to get tipped is actually the primary selling point of the profession itself. It's a big reason why lots of people actually choose to be waiters or servers instead of choosing to be a different profession.\n\nObviously, some people tip more than others, and some people don't tip at all. After all, it is the customer's choice whether or not to tip. You can't force customers to tip, the same way you can't force people to work for low wages. Servers already know this, and despite that, they still choose to be servers anyway.\n\nIt is your right to tip as much or as little as you want. You also have no obligation to tip if you don't want to tip. However, that doesn't stop servers and waiters from believing that they are entitled to tips, even though that is very much a false belief. And it also doesn't stop them from gaslighting people into thinking that people are obligated to tip, even though that is very much false.\n\n# Common Arguments\n\n\"But servers rely on tips for their livelihood! If you don't tip, then they won't be able to pay their bills!\"\n\nIf that's actually true, then they would have already lost their power and water a long time ago. Plenty of customers don't tip. Plenty of servers are still able to pay their bills anyway despite that fact.\n\nIt's not your responsibility as the customer to make sure that the waiter can pay his bills. It's the waiter's responsibility to make sure that he pays his own bills.\n\n\"If you can't afford to tip, then don't go out to eat!\"\n\nThe premise of this argument is the false belief that servers are entitled to tips and that customers must tip. If you reject that false belief, you should also reject this argument. Servers and waiters are just as obligated to serve the customers that don't tip as they are to serve the customers that do tip. If you can't afford to tip, then don't tip. Don't feel bad about it either.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBy pretending like tipping is some kind of moral obligation, and feeling like you must tip every single time, you are simply playing into what the servers want. Tipping is not simply an additional benefit for the servers and for the waiters. No, it is a tool for the customers to use to their advantage.\n\nIf your server does their job properly, then feel free to tip them, if you want to do so. If your server does their job poorly, then don't hesitate to withhold the tip. Servers are not entitled to tips, they must earn them.\n\nThe real benefit of tipping culture is the power that it gives to the customer. As a customer, you have the power to decide how much your server gets paid. Don't give up that power. The worst thing to do, in my opinion, is to just tip a fixed percentage (like 15 or 20 percent) no matter how well the server did. It completely defeats the purpose of tipping, which is to put the customer in the driver's seat.", "authorship": "human"}

In reality, most people with low self-esteem don't do this and simply have unrealistically negative opinions about themselves in their own head, without voicing them - in fact, if their self-esteem is the lowest, it means they're unlikely to voice them, because they fully believe the negative opinions are true.

Which returns nicely to my original claim; That I will be taking no action to mitigate climate change, nor reduce my carbon footprint.  \n\nIt all comes down to basic tragedy of the common's fallacy. The belief in a shared, finite resource of which all have access to (the environment/planet’s resources), and that everyone will ultimately act within their own self-interest to extract the most value possible before said resource is depleted. The driving force behind the fallacy, is that since we all expect everyone else to act dishonestly within their own self-interest, hence we too act within our self-interests, because why should we put in effort if nobody else will?

They're not only responsible for the learning and education of hundreds of adolescents per year, they're also babysitters who have an implicit goal of trying to mold how someone functions in society in a way that's beneficial. I don't think its an exaggeration to say that outside of your family, these high school teachers are the most influential adults in your life as an adolescent. They're the adults you spend the most time around in your teens, they're the ones who serve as the mentors in athletic/education pursuits, and often times they are the ones who serve as a guide on your first steps on finding out who you want to be.\n\nDespite this, many teachers are predatory weirdos and bottom of the barrel rejects. The ones who aren't are often overworked, overwhelmed, and underpaid to the point that I can only assume they're masochists for choosing the job. The job is not looked upon respectfully by society no matter what lip service is paid by celebrities and politicians. Schools are more concerned with getting a warm body to stand in a classroom than having someone qualified teach. The district overstuffs classrooms to the point of absurdity and shuffles around known bad apples to different areas because they don't have enough teachers. Why? Because being a teacher is a shit job and we as a society don't value it despite its importance.\n\nIt doesn't make sense to me that such an important job is filled with so many unqualified and dangerous hacks and the ones who are qualified are usually treated like shit. My proposed change would be to make high school teaching an actually prestigious job instead of it being seen as borderline bum job it is now. Maybe these steps could server as a start.\n\n1. Higher pay - Pretty self explanatory, teachers are paid like shit. They should be getting paid much more. In return it should be a job that requires a lot of qualification and impeccable behavior. Being a teacher should be something to aspire to because you are paid and treated well.\n2. Stricter Requirements - With more pay, more is required. Stricter background checks on teachers and stricter rules on their conduct. I've seen too many suspect teachers skirt around. We should've be having Joe Schmo be responsible for 100s of kids every year.\n3. Stricter monitoring - This applies to both students and teachers. The behaviors of both should be held to a higher standard than what we have today. Society should let students be punished or fail but on the other hand we should also be more aware of teacher misconduct so we don't let bad apples misbehave.\n\nThese would just be a start but a societal shift in the way we view teaching would massively benefit us in the long run.

Even when blue collar jobs are harder, something about the physical motion of doing the work with your hands, especially if you're an independent operator is just a far cry from the corporate world.\n\nIn the corporate world, you can sort of fly under the radar and your work ethic can often matter a lot less.\n\nIn an independent contractor type of position, your work directly determines your income.

But more to the point, the work is often a lot more abstract, and the impact is often less clear.\n\nSo, people in corporate jobs may often feel that things need to be mandated by the federal government, because it's this prescribed \"work 40 hours a week with a very inflexible schedule, doing work where the impact isn't super obvious.\"\n\nLess people should go to college. We should structure society to be more of a meritocracy; part of the problem is that we are NOT a meritocracy nearly to the degree that we should be. Because the corporate world is so abstract and political, so much of the reward tends to favor those who are politically intelligent in that structure, and that doesn't always translate into better products and services.\n\nFurthermore, the government props so many companies that should have died long ago. \"Too big to fail\" is like saying a giant tumor is too big to be removed.\n\nTL;DR - Corporate America's contrived structures and perverse incentives are misaligned with meritocracy, and this drives people to support liberal economic policies where the government regulates work.

I'm 21 and within the last 5 years I've gained and last over 5-15kg all throughout each year. Gain and lose, gain and lose. So much of my life (since I was 15) has consisted around being a food addict and stress eater. I've lost the weight multiple times and I've gained the weight multiple times. And I lose weight in a healthy way I'm just addicted to sugar so it's never enough for me. Also, once stress hits I can never sustain it. Weight loss and gain is just so mentally taxing and I'm sick of it. I know I'm not the only one who's experienced this: having their mind be mentally taxed because of food and weight. I literally missed new year's celebrations with my friends just so I could binge eat. My happiest highs in life consist of getting off on food and then having to lie to people about why I didn't show up and what I was really doing (which was bingeing lol). \n\nThe fact that people do not think about their weight ever because they don't obsess over food and have an addiction is crazy to me. \n\nThe fact that there's a drug that opens people up to this experience is amazing.

But lemme just share my opinion/experience\n\nFirst of all: THIS IS ALL ABOUT FRIENDSHIP/CONNECTIONS. NOT ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS NOR FEELINGS. IF YOU CAN'T APPROACH A FRIENDSHIP OR CONNECTION WITHOUT ASSUMING SOMETHING ELSE, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU, AND I'M GENUINELY SORRY FOR YOU\n\nI'm 17. I've been in both situations. I've always had friends both older and younger than me. People my age have been consistently hard to befriend, because in my opinion most of seem too shallow. I'm going to break it down by categories, for simplicity's sake:\n\nFirst, people older than me. Since I was little, I've always been interested in stuff, mainly science, that was way beyond my age. All about atoms and cells at 5; space, geology and geometry at 7/8, etc. While my classmates were playing tag or whatever, I was chatting with the substitute teachers about random fun facts from stuff I'd learned. This is what you can POSSIBLY have in common with a kid. I felt way more comfortable/confident with them than I did with my classmates, which would never listen to me or take me seriously.\n\nAs I grew older, the age with which I felt confident around started diminishing, but eventually I had 3 or 4 close friends that were 3-6 years older than me. These friendships were incredibly important in my life. I had some really good people to look up to.\n\n\n\nMy grandma always tells me that teaching is the best way to learn. Nowhere is that more apparent than in spending time with younger people/kids. I get to be that boy they look up to, and I get to know myself better and be more comfortable with myself\n\nMy cousins are 14 and 11. They're the closest people to me after my immediate family. I know people will say \"WELL IT DOESN'T COUNT BECAUSE THEY'RE YOUR FAMILY. Ok, some of my friends from my immediate friend group are also 12/13, and I'm close with them. How is that weird?\n\nThe amount of assumptions and projections that arise from these kinds of stories are genuinely worrying. I'm not saying that the concept of maturity is relative, which is NOT, but that shouldn't dictate the stuff that you can/can't have in common as much as overall boundaries should, obviously set by both the younger and the older persons. They should also be taught more thoroughly by parents. Another example:\n\nIn a family camp I went to last year, I met a girl about 8 which started talking to me and stuff, and we kinda became \"friends\" for the remainder of the camp. What was I supposed to do, ignore her?\n\nJust be careful and you're good, for example, I refused to tickle her when she asked me, just because I didn't feel comfortable touching her, and it was not a good lesson for her. That's a boundary that a kid might not respect, but it's inalienable\n\nWhen they saw her with me, no one batted an eye. Hell, I was talking with her mother while holding her, and she even smiled.\n\nSo yeah, that should be the norm. Doesn't matter if they're older or younger, as long as it's a genuine connection without anything else, and you set proper boundaries, you're good to go.\n\nIf you don't see it like this, I'm genuinely curious as to why, so feel free to discuss\n\n:)", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 578, "title": "Immigration is a good thing", "article": "I've been seeing a lot of nativist rhetoric on reddit ever since Elon and Vivek came out in support of H1Bs, and I figured I should do something about it. At it's core, most of the arguments for restricting H1-Bs or other forms of immigration are protectionist in nature.\n\nImmigration is a good thing because:\n\n\\-they aren't actually taking jobs.\n\n\\-it leads to a more robust economy.\n\n\\-long term American birth rate decline leading to decreased tax base and looming employee shortage.\n\nEconomists have come up with the term \"[lump of labor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lump-of-labour-fallacy.asp)\" fallacy to describe concerns about immigrants taking jobs. The starting assumption for people who make this fallacy is that there is a fixed number of jobs and allowing other people to take those jobs hurts American workers.\n\nThe reality is that the number of jobs are dynamic, and based on laws of supply and demand. Jobs are created and destroyed, but positive displacement occurs when sectors become more efficient and spur greater specialization.\n\nCounterintuitively, economists have [repeatedly](https://www.mercatus.org/research/policy-briefs/unintended-consequences-restrictions-h-1b-visas) [observed](https://www.cato.org/publications/research-briefs-economic-policy/how-do-restrictions-high-skilled-immigration-affect) positive impacts from immigration.\n\nHow can this be? The primary explanation for this has been that:\n\n&gt;high-skilled foreign workers are complements for American workers, which means that companies have some roles that they cannot fill with American workers and others that can be filled by American workers. That is, American high-skilled workers and foreign high-skilled workers may possess different skillsets that are effective when combined together. For example, to create an artificial intelligence robotics department, a company might require a highly specialized skillset that it cannot find in the United States, so it hires a foreign worker to lead the department. However, the department needs additional workers to be on the team, and these are filled by American workers. This means that when a company cannot hire high-skilled foreign workers to create the department, then the additional department jobs for Americans workers are also lost.\n\nWhat actually happens with increased immigration restrictions is that companies decide to offshore, and simply go directly to other countries to find the hires they want instead of attracting immigrants to the states. With less immigration restrictions, the long term shows greater job creation and increased productivity.\n\nBesides bring labor, immigrants bring exchange of goods and services with them and this is relevant to the next point.\n\nSeveral states are [currently facing low birth rates and will have a decreased tax base](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2022/12/the-long-term-decline-in-fertility-and-what-it-means-for-state-budgets) as a result. Simply put, a critical mass of people is needed to maintain a society and ensure that ample goods and services are provided.\n\nThat is where immigrants can come in. Immigrants don't just work, they also have to spend money on housing, food, gas, cars, clothing, etc. This also spurs economic activity.\n\nThey also pay taxes, and they can't immediately access social services. To see a practical example of how immigration helped with a population deficit, one can simply look at how [successful Singapore](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/cato-working-paper-53-update.pdf) is.\n\nSome of the above arguments, especially to those in tech, may fall flat because of layoffs. The thinking is that if there is currently an oversupply of labor, why bring in more people?\n\nTo see how ruinous this thinking be, we can look at medicine. I am simplifying the story here, but about 30 years ago there was predicted to be an oversupply of doctors. The medical field intervened, and increased the barriers to entry to try to protect physician wages.\n\nAmong many other protectionist measures in the medical field, one of those barriers entry remains how difficult it is for international medical graduates to work in the US. People who have already been trained and are competent doctors and do not need money invested in them to start contributing to the economy, often end up having to pursue allied health professions and are shut out of being doctors entirely.\n\nIn the short term, doctors succeeded. They command high wages, but this had negative consequences down the line. Today, restrictive immigration practices are one of many reasons contributing to a physician shortage. The physician shortage has wide ranging effects and looks like increased burnout, greater patient uncertainty as to when they get their next appointment, increased costs, decreased access to care for rural patients, and a general muted productivity in medicine as to what it could be.\n\nHopefully, this post addresses a lot of the arguments made on reddit.\n\n ", "authorship": "human"}

In essence they are asked to put aside their religious values in the realm of politics. The problem is, religion is an axiomatic value. Axiomatic values are the thing that supersedes all other values or to put it another way it's a first principle. These are the values that undergird all others. Here's an example of a non religious axiom. \n\nPerson A: \"I support free trade\", \nPerson B: \"why?\"\n\nPerson A \"I think it's the most efficient way to allocate resources.\" \nPerson B: \"why do you care about that?\" \n\nPerson A: \"the efficient allocation of resources makes people wealthier\" \nPerson B: \"why do you care about that?\" \n\nPerson A: \"I think people are happier when they have money\". \nPerson B:  \"why do you care about that?\" \n\nPerson A: \"I think it's good when people are as happy as possible\"\nPerson B: \"why?\" \n\nPerson A: \"happiness is good\"\nPerson B: \"why?\"\n\nPerson A: \"umm....\"\n\nPerson A has an axiom which is that happiness is good.

Hilariously, one discussion I saw today was how retail workers shouldn't have to tell customers their names because they don't owe them that information. Lol. Today's wisdom is that we are disconnected, autonomous islands, with no responsibilities towards others if we don't voluntarily take them on.\n\nI believe this is wrong in a cosmological sense and is a society-destroying if actually enacted. You can't have a society in which there are no social obligations between people. We already have that substantiated in law, but outside of legal matters it's important as well. For example, you may be able to tell I'm going through online dating, and the ghosting we have in today's age is a point of consternation for me and for many. I think this is due to a breakdown in how we see social responsibility. If you really don't have any obligation to anyone, then ghosting is totally fine...but we all know literally nobody likes it. So, if you don't want to see someone, you probably have some level of obligation to say so, **Provided they gave you the initial respect that you should receive as a human by at least showing politeness and obeying whatever the social norms are for online dating.**\n\nBecause I don't want this to be about just online dating, there are posts on reddit, typically the relationship focused ones, about cutting people off, including parents, and people will cut off parents for basically no reason, and the comments are often like \"Yeah! F those guys! You don't owe your parents shit!\". Well, no. You don't owe your parents the world, you can't pay them back for your food and education as a child, and they can't ask for that in any reasonable world, but if you're going to cut your parents off, you'd better have a good reason. \n\nThe reason I say everyone is that, for a society to function, there has to be some guarantee of mutual respect, and I think that has to go beyond \"leaving people alone\". Yes, in most cases you should leave people to their business. But as a Christian, I can't see street people and think \"Eh, not my business\". We owe them something as a society, even if they are strangers. \n\nI propose this: For a society to function, **respect is something** ***owed by you*****, to others.** Yes, it is still conditional, but it is not earned.\n\nPlease discuss.

So in exchange of removing all billionaires from society (and scaring off literally every single wealthy person by doing so (need some evidence?  Look at the rate of capital flight from the UK over the past decade)), you managed to fund the government for just over a year.  Wow.  Good job.

While the people being honored by the new names are certainly deserving of the honor, such a big 180-degree flip on the name where the new honoree is the exact opposite of the original honoree makes me think that the institution only honored them in order to make a statement about the original names, and that they didn't view them as worthy of honor in their own right by having their names placed on either a new building or place, or something that had previously been unnamed, and the existing building's being renamed for something completely unrelated.  In other words, the new honorees are being shortchanged by being a convenient way to dispose of an undesired name, and are second-best by only being chosen for the honor after bad people were removed.\n\nSame goes for the Columbus Day/Indigenous People's Day debate.  I feel like indigenous people should have a holiday recognizing their contributions to society.  But by redesignating Columbus Day as that day makes me think that they aren't considered worthy of the honor in their own right, but are only seen as a convenient way to dispose of a holiday named after an historical figure that is no saint, thus giving them Columbus' used holiday.  If you want to designate a holiday for indigenous people, great - create a new holiday on a new date, and eliminate the old holiday as a separate thing.\n\nIn other words, if someone is as worthy of an honor as you think, give them the full honor by placing their name on something new, and not as an obvious reaction to a bad name.", "authorship": "human"}

It’s the proof that, even in a world filled with greed, hatred, and suffering, there’s still something worth fighting for. But if you've never had it—never felt what it’s like to be someone's *one and only*—you're left in the dark, trying to convince yourself that your hobbies, career, or self-love are \"enough.\" Spoiler alert: they aren’t. Family and friends aren't even as important as romance.\n\nSeeing couples walk by, happy and *whole*, while you sit on the sidelines of life is a type of torment no one talks about. You’re not just lonely—you’re *less*. Less human, less important, less worthy. Everyone says, “Oh, you’ll find someone someday,” like that’s supposed to keep you going. But let’s be real: some people *don’t*. Some people die having never felt what it’s like to be loved and that's a fate worse than any deadly disease. \n\nAnd you know what? That’s a valid reason to be depressed. Love isn’t just a “bonus” to life—it’s the main event. Without it, the world is just a series of gray, pointless days, leading inevitably to death. No one’s going to remember you. No one’s going to miss you. You’re a spectator in a game you’ll never play, and when you finally leave, the world will keep spinning like you were never here.\n\nPeople will tell you, “Focus on yourself first.” Yeah, sure, but to what end? You can work out, get rich, and achieve every goal you set, but it all feels hollow if there’s no one to share it with. We’re wired to connect. Denying that need is like trying to survive without food or water. It’s unnatural.\n\nSo yeah, if you’ve never experienced romance, you have every right to feel miserable. I would too.

We have to be honest with not only those who disagree but also ourselves. \n\nFirstly, I'm a dude, so my scope is obviously limited by that factor. However, an abortion is ultimately a procedure to remove a thing that will eventually become a human being, and further, somebody's child. It is absolutely not out of the question in my view that even if a woman determines abortion is the right decision and something that is not immoral, there may be still some sense of connection and a sense of loss, shame or grief that can be experienced from losing that connection, both internally and externally from society. Pregnancy and birth are things that are highly regarded and respected universally by basically all human beings, and the body begins the production of influential hormones as soon as implantation occurs. This can be a very difficult time emotionally for a lot of people, and we shouldn't be afraid of respecting and addressing that. It may feel like ceding ground to the pro life side, but it's actually one less gotcha in their toolbelt when debates occur. \n\nAdditionally, abortion is a somewhat invasive medical procedure that can be very uncomfortable physically, and poses risks like any other procedure. From another psychological end, it's a whole drive to some clinic you might not have even been to before, it can be quite expensive, and there's probably a bunch of weird creeps screaming at you and holding signs plastered with medical gore in your face. However, and my experience here is extremely limited but to my knowledge/limited experience, I have never heard anything bad about the staff at these clinics. In basically every instance I've heard of and experienced, these people are immensely supportive, empathetic, willing to work with you on the financial side, and very professional. \n\nI don't want to knock the clinics themselves at all, especially given all the other immensely important services places like Planned Parenthood provides. But still, even if you trust your surgeon, going into surgery can be an emotionally daunting proposition and can be kinda scary because it's so infrequent for most people, and I don't see why the same wouldn't be true for an abortion.

{"Article Number": 684, "title": "Part of the reason why women are so disappointed with modern dating is because way women evaluate men doesn't work for selecting an equal relationship.", "article": "This may be confusing, and I don't mean to paint women here with an overly large brush, but some generalizing is necessary. I'll establish the points, which I believe will be mostly agreed upon. We'll start by saying that I'm talking about women seeking men. \n\n1. Women looking for men nowadays find the men they do find disappointing often. You will see \"the bar is on the floor for men\" stated often, by a certain type of person. This may be because of points 2 and 3, which are:\n\n2. Women are desiring more equal relationships than in years past where the income and household work splits are closer to 50/50.\n\n3. Women are still seeking men that will make firm relationship commitments to them. This means monogamy (except where it doesn't, but we aren't talking about those people), and men who will define the relationship firmly, without unnecessary ambiguities. We're talking about women looking for marriage here, at least eventually, which is still a lot of women. \n\n4. Outside of those things, women still want a man who is handsome, has good social skills, dresses well, is in good shape, and earns a strong income, has career drive and ambition, and wants to take care of her, all other things being equal. I may get pushback on the \"takes care of her\" point, but I think many will still find this to be true.\n\n5. Women like it when a man takes charge in the early stages of a relationship, which means asking the woman out, setting the dates, paying for them, and other things. The thing which made my thoughts click is when I saw one woman on online dating say \"Bonus points for you if you can tell me how to dress on our first date\".\n\nI haven't written it out in enough detail to state it simply enough, but I believe what I've come to understand is that women find disappointment because the things they look for in men don't translate to equal relationships. \n\nIn other words, point 1 is basically in contradiction with points 2 through 5. Take the last example I gave in point 5. Having a man tell you how to dress for your first date is pretty patriarchal, no? If you're asking for that, you are telegraphing a patriarchal relationship, and you are selecting for men who will want a more patriarchal relationship. Having a man plan things out for you and pay is 1). telegraphing that you want a man to be in charge of you, and 2), telegraphing that you are an \"item\" that needs to be paid for.\n\nOn point 4, there are a few things. A guy with better social skills will be more socially dominant and less likely to take on the woman's traditional roles in a relationship. A guy with more income will be more focused on his job and will be less inclined to do housework. Additionally, men used to be able to dress well because they had stronger male role models who told them how to dress. If you want less male dominance in society, you would have to accept that there would be fewer male role models around to morph men into the man you would want them to be, and you'll have to take on more of the responsibility. This is admittedly my weakest point. \n\nOn point 3, one of the things which has remained from patriarchy the hardest and which seems to want to go away the least is that the man defines the relationship status, once the woman lets there be one, of course. Think about this; the one thing that the man still pretty much *always* does in a relationship, even now, is be the one to ask the woman to marry him. Feminism has changed much, but it doesn't seem to have changed this. If it's the man's responsibility to do the asking, that puts the power in the man's hands to define the relationship, which is pretty patriarchal.\n\nI'm getting long winded at this point. I think I've figured out a simpler way to state it; as long as you, as a woman, are seeking a relatively modern relationship, but are using the tenets of more traditional masculinity to find a man for that relationship, you are in conflict. \n\nThis has also helped me realize that part of the animosity between men and women is that the statement \"The bar is on the floor for guys\" is sort of true...once the guy is in the relationship. It's definitely not true for  guys who aren't in a relationship already. \n\nINB4:\n\nNo, I am not an i-word.  \nNo, this does not justify i-word rhetoric.  \nNo, this does not justify hating women (or men, for that matter).   \nNo, I am not saying that women should go back to the kitchen, or that we should go back to the 1950's or before.   \nNo, men are not trash.  \nNo, women are not trash.  \nNo, I am not saying you as a woman personally want patriarchy. I am saying that many of the things you may want in a man or in a relationship may be vestiges of patriarchy.   \nNo, I am not saying patricarchy is good.\n\n  \nThank you all and Happy New Year.", "authorship": "human"}

No matter the topic—be it skepticism, joe Rogan, or gardening—someone inevitably posts an inflammatory political take that has no place in the community.

It’s about maintaining the integrity of spaces dedicated to other things. Political content might belong in subreddits designed for it, but when it invades unrelated communities, it derails conversations, drives away users, and erodes the quality of the platform.\n\nI can already hear someone furiously typing, “Everything is political!” And you know what? You’re not wrong. If someone wants to discuss how the current economy is affecting camping supplies in a camping forum, that’s completely understandable and even relevant.

These posts don’t contribute to the subreddit’s intended purpose; they just turn it into yet another echo chamber for partisan sniping.\n\nHere’s a simple solution:\n\t1.\tIf moderators consistently fail to enforce their own subreddit’s rules—especially against irrelevant political content—they should lose their ownership.\n\t2.\tOwnership should pass to active, responsible moderators, or the subreddit should be archived entirely.\n\t3.\tThis would force moderators to take their responsibilities seriously, ensuring subreddits remain focused on their original purpose and not yet another soapbox for political arguments.\n\nThis issue isn’t just annoying; it’s a rot that spreads across Reddit. The more subreddits allow themselves to be hijacked by off-topic political content, the more the platform as a whole loses its value as a space for diverse, topic-focused communities. If a subreddit can’t uphold its rules and protect its identity, it’s time for Reddit to step in.\n\nYes, this opinion might rub some people the wrong way, but subreddits are supposed to be about fostering community, not turning every discussion into the same exhausting, never-ending political argument.

And you know what? I’m *happy* it’s shaking up the art world. All those elitist, white-collar “real” artists who act like their work is some holy grail are finally getting a taste of reality—and they deserve it.\n\nFor years, these so-called “artists” have looked down their noses at everyone else, gatekeeping creativity like it’s some exclusive club. They’ve made art all about cliques, galleries, and overpriced BS that no one but rich people can afford. Meanwhile, the rest of us are left trying to make sense of a squiggle on a canvas or, better yet, a *banana duct-taped to a wall* that costs six figures. Seriously, that was their idea of \"art.\"\n\nNow AI comes along, and suddenly *anyone* can create something jaw-dropping without having to spend years learning how to hold a paintbrush or wasting money on art school. And guess what? It’s pissing off all those pretentious artists who think their “process” is more important than the actual result. Newsflash: nobody cares how many hours you spent crying over your canvas if an AI can create something ten times better in five minutes.\n\nThe funniest part? These artists are so delusional they’re out here crying about some made-up \"soul\" nonsense, as if art needs to have magical fairy dust sprinkled on it to be valid. Spoiler alert: art is about what you feel when you see it, not how much the creator suffered for it. Half the “art” hanging in galleries already feels soulless anyway, so spare us the dramatics.\n\nThey also whine about AI \"stealing\" from them, but let’s not pretend humans haven’t been ripping each other off for centuries. Every artist is inspired by someone else—it’s how creativity works. AI is just doing the same thing, but faster and without the whining.\n\nSo yeah, AI art is better. It’s faster, cooler, and way more accessible. And the fact that it’s flipping the art world on its head? That’s just the cherry on top. If you’re one of those snobby artists who’s mad about it—good. Maybe it’s time you got off your high horse and joined the rest of us in the real world.\n\nCry harder. AI isn’t going anywhere.

If you think they're doing it purely out of kindness, you’re kidding yourself. Everybody wants something in return, even if it's just the warm, fuzzy feeling of thinking they’re a \"good person.\" Most people will put on a mask, but take it off, and they’re just looking out for #1.\n\nEven the ones who claim to have \"good intentions\" or are always preaching about love and peace? They’re usually the most judgmental. They won’t hesitate to tear down someone they think is “less than” or \"not good enough.\" And let’s not even get started on those who say they don’t care about money, fame, or status. Yeah, okay. We all care. Everyone cares. It's hardwired into us. No one's above it.\n\nAnd don’t even talk about the \"heroes\" of the world—the ones who save lives, donate to charities, whatever. They’ve got their own dark corners. No one’s perfect. People are so damn quick to judge others for being selfish, but then they turn around and make excuses for their own bad behavior. Everyone’s just hiding behind some version of \"I'm a good person, I promise.\" But if you really look closely, you’ll see the cracks. You’ll see their flaws.\n\nAt the end of the day, we’re all just out here trying to survive, and in that process, we screw people over without even thinking about it sometimes.

At a faster rate than the people who are entering the work force.\n\nSo this will mean that we have to generate more money for the ageing retirees' benefits from a decreasing workforce which leads to higher and higher taxes on the working class making it unbearable for young working people to live their own lives with upward  financial movement.\n\nAnd because of the falling birth rate, it'll mean the old people are the bigger voting bloc and will force politicians to cater to their s even at young people's expense so policies that I crease tax to fund welfare will get passed.\n\nThis will lead the young working to have even less kids because they'll be overworked and the negative feedback looks will be sealed.\n\nThere are 3 solutions to this, both suck for somebody :\n\n1. Reduce the rate of people who qualify for welfare benefits by rasing the retirement age so that more peopne keep working and your system isn't strained as much.\n2. .Abolish the Retirement  SSI Sytem or reduce the number of benefits it contains for retirees so that everyone has to keep working for themselves and those that retire aren't a big  burden on the government and the young working class gets taxed less..really everyone gets taxed less here.\n3. Increase the number of people entering the work force via immigration or increasing the birth rates. Immigration is a stop gap solution that doesn't work in the long term since 2nd generation Americans follow the same birth tends as 3rd+ gen Americans.\n\nThe only way to increase the birth rate with current technology is to regulate abortion and birth control access. Advanced capitalistic nations in Scandinavia have tried all kinds of state birth incentives that failed. The only way to make people have mkre kids is to narrow the gap between sex frequency and pregnancy frequency.

Not to mention the people that watch Arcane stay far away from League, further disrespecting the source material and  not understanding the character at all. It's the over complicating of everything, it's the bastardization of everything. People love the Joker because he's just that, an embodiment of chaos, anarchy, and mayhem. He causes destruction just because he wants to see the world burn. We don't have a whole ass game focused on how he became the Joker. He just is.

So many other champions have a story genuinely worth expanding upon and exploring, but not they choose the already established and fine as is characters and give them more for no reason.

", "article": "Let me break this down for you in plain terms. Hello, former 37F - US Army Psychological Operations Specialist here. When I say I know what propaganda is, it's because I literally made it. We just don't call it propaganda—only \"the enemy\" does that.\n\n\n\nNow, let's kill some myths.\n\n\nMyth One: \"They're all brainwashed.\"\n\n\n\nWrong. I can't brainwash anyone. No one can. I can’t make you think, believe, or act in a way that's against your core nature. You know why? Because propaganda doesn’t create new beliefs—it amplifies what's already there. People don’t magically adopt ideas; propaganda works by exploiting bi@ses, fears, or inclinations that already exist. It provides justification, not transformation. People won’t act contrary to their nature, and propaganda doesn’t overwrite that—it just directs it. That’s why it’s a convenient scapegoat for bad behavior: \"It wasn’t me, it was the propaganda!\" Or, as they used to say back in the day, \"The devil made me do it!\"\n\n\n\nMyth Two: \"I’m too smart to fall for it.\"\n\n\n\n((Laughs in psy-op)). Oh, sweetheart, no. Your arrogance makes you an easy target. All I have to do is stroke that ego of yours. Flatter you. Tell you you’re special, enlightened, smarter than \"those other idiots.\" I’ll tell you you’re on the right side of history, and they’re the bad guys. Sound familiar? You’ll eat it up because it feeds your ego, and before you know it, you’re parroting the same points I designed for you.\n\n\n\nMyth Three: \"Only those people fall for propaganda.\"\n\n\n\nNope. Everyone is susceptible to it. You, me, everyone. Why? Because propaganda is just targeted marketing. It’s tailor-made to appeal to your wants, needs, fears, and desires. You think you’re immune because you’re logical, but I’m not going after your logic—I’m going for your emotions. Because if I can get you to feel, you’ll forget to think. That’s the whole game.\n\n\nFast food ads? That’s propaganda. They don’t sell burgers; they sell happiness and family moments. ASPCA commercials? Same deal—they trigger guilt and compassion. It’s all about emotional manipulation. Even neon signs are propaganda in a way—they’re designed to catch your eye. It’s everywhere, and it works because it’s made for you.\n\n\n\nThe Truth About Propaganda:\n\n\n\nI’m not trying to convert everyone. That’s not how it works. I’m not going to turn a vegetarian into a steak lover with my steakhouse ad. But that’s fine—I’m not talking to vegetarians. I’m targeting the people who already love steak. I’m showing them sizzling steaks, happy diners, and good times. I’m tapping into their existing desires. I’ve already accounted for the people I won’t reach. What matters is getting enough of the right people to bite, and I will.\n\n\nSo no, propaganda isn’t some all-powerful force that magically rewires brains.

{"Article Number": 742, "title": "Reddit is a Liberal Echo Chamber", "article": "Reddit’s upvote/downvote system creates a self-reinforcing cycle that favors popular opinions, and since Reddit leans heavily liberal, it ends up becoming a liberal echo chamber. The way the system works—by summing upvotes and downvotes—means that the most \"agreeable\" comments rise to the top. If a comment doesn’t align with the predominant viewpoint, it gets buried, regardless of how well-reasoned or factual it might be.\n\nTo make things worse, Reddit’s infrastructure itself isn’t as decentralized or democratic as it seems. Did you know that **92 of the top 500 subreddits are controlled by just 4 people**? These mods wield an immense amount of power, essentially deciding what conversations can and can’t happen in massive communities like politics, worldnews, news. The implications are obvious: this concentrated control allows for a heavy bias in content moderation, often skewing towards liberal perspectives while censoring or suppressing dissenting views. It’s like a gatekeeping mechanism disguised as a free platform.\n\nNow let’s talk about how this plays out with non-liberal polarizing figures like Elon Musk. Love him or hate him, there’s no denying that Reddit has a knack for spinning anything related to him into a negative narrative. A perfect example is the controversy surrounding Starlink in Ukraine. When SpaceX provided **free** Starlink service to Ukraine, the agreement explicitly stated that it would be used for humanitarian purposes, like providing internet to hospitals and civilians, and not for military operations. However, when Ukrainian forces couldn’t use Starlink in a specific military zone for an offensive, Reddit threads were filled with accusations that Musk deliberately sabotaged Ukraine’s efforts by \"shutting down\" Starlink.\n\nThe truth? Musk didn’t “shut down” anything—SpaceX never agreed to enable Starlink in those zones in the first place. Despite this, Reddit narratives ignored these facts and painted him as someone undermining Ukraine’s war efforts.

{"Article Number": 749, "title": "Many traits of \"emotional intelligence\" are just conditioning from a relatively privileged life experience of prior positive interpersonal experiences", "article": "I was reading Dan Goleman's book about emotional intelligence (EQ). It describes EQ as:\n\n1. *Knowing one's emotions*\n2. *Managing emotions*\n3. *Motivating oneself*\n\n*4. Recognizing emotions in others*\n\n*5. Handling relationships*\n\n**He also describes high EQ men/women as:**\n\n\\-Outgoing, cheerful, assertive, feel positive about themselves, socially poised, life holds meaning for them, adapt well to stress, express their feelings directly, not prone to fearfulness or worried rumination, sympathetic, good capacity for taking responsibility, caring in relationships.\n\n**And described low EQ men/women as:**\n\n\\-Critical, inhibited, condescending, unexpressive, detached, emotionally bland, prone to anxiety, prone to guilt, prone to rumination, hesitant to express their anger directly\n\nThe \"high EQ\" descriptors mostly sound like the result of positive previous interpersonal experiences, while the \"low EQ\" ones mostly sound like the result of negative previous interpersonal experiences. Anyone can be cheerful, assertive, feel positive about themselves, feel life has meaning and have good practice of feeling and expressing emotions, if they've been encouraged by others in the past and have a dearth of discouragment. If someone is repeatedly shamed, rejected, ridiculed, has their needs or opinions trampled on or is outright assaulted, they will not be as carefree or impassioned in life, or as well-practiced in feeling emotions or expressing emotions. Partly because they'll learn to reflexively suppress emotions due to their only emotions being painful ones and partly they'll supress their emotions and display of emotions because they need to stay safe and displaying certain emotions is not safe in their environment - but unfortunately the reality is often \"use it or lose it\" (at least temporarily).\n\nUnlike the aspects of intelligence that IQ tries to measure, the description of \"emotional intelligence\" (EQ) doesn't seem to be anything innate or even close to stable. Rather, it seems to be much more the result of a privileged upbringing or life, rather than any actual intelligence. IQ can be negatively affected by things like stress or depression, but for that we're talking about maybe a 10-15% decrease, while with EQ I'd say you could see a near-100% decrease from stress. Let's say you physically and sexually torture somebody in a prison for a few years and tell them it's what the world thinks they deserve and mock, shame or punish them for any emotional reactivity, and let's say you have their primary caregivers and family partake in it too - I think you could achieve a near 100% decrease in EQ after a while, but nowhere near the same decrease in IQ.\n\nIt would be very difficult to take a high IQ person, with innately high empathy from birth, and turn them into a low IQ person according to Goleman's description, without delivering some major physical brain damage. However, it would be quite easy to take a high EQ child or even high EQ adult, and turn them into a low EQ person, purely through harsh treatment or social rejection and without any physical brain damage.\n\nI found it a little ironic that he's calling people who are shy or have been conditioned to be emotionally closed off \"emotionally unintelligent\" - IMO this viewpoint lacks the EQ to realise that people are emotionally affected by their prior life experiences or intolerant environments or that not everyone expresses emotions or empathy in the same way, and that cultural conditioning is part of this - for example, different cultures use different amounts of verbal and non-verbal cues when talking.

Japanese also focus on different facial cues compare to Americans - [they focus more on the eyes, rather than the mouth](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103106000321) and receive more communication via the eyes (here's a Japanese language teacher [talking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MJSZn8voDo) about it).\n\n", "authorship": "human"}

The right has been using a strategy called \"The 2 Santa Strategy\" that was developed and actually put into practice during Reagan's presidency (right around when the wealth gap began and continues to explode, funny that). The \"2 Santa Strategy,\" which you can fact check me if you would like, involves recklessly spending and instituting financial policies that will offer short term boosts to economic performance in exchange for massively inflating the debt and causing long term economic harm. Then when they are no longer in power, they relentlessly point out the economic damage and blame it on the left. \n\nThere's also the \"Starve the Beast,\" Strategy that goes hand in hand with the previously mentioned. This plan revolves around intentional sabotage of government programs or departments until they are completely ineffective, then once they have gutted it to a nonfunctional shadow of its intended purpose, they can cry about how poorly these things are handled and cut it's funding for their own gain, either through the privatization of these programs or just completely erasing them to make room for new tax cuts, which oddly always benefit the rich more than the poor. \n\nImmigration: Trump got up on stage one day and started completely making shit up about immigrants, saying counties were just emptying their prisons across our border, throwing a wave of rapists and killers at us, but that's complete bullshit you guys gobbled right up. Not only do immigrants perform crimes at a lower rate than natural born US citizens, but they are essential for the continued functioning of our economy. They not only provide massive amounts of labor that US citizens do not want to do, but they pay into things like Social Security and Medicare without ever pulling any benefits from those programs for themselves.

{"Article Number": 774, "title": "Call of duty: modern warfare 2 (2022) was a good game", "article": "like the title says. I really enjoyed modern warfare 2, and I think that it was actually really good, and I will provide a couple reasons as to why\n\n1. Campaign - I thought the campaign's story was alright, but I really liked how it played out. the mission \"alone\" was one of my favorites, honestly. Recon by fire is a close second. the way they implemented the sniping, and made it so you can get a different angle to get 2 kills at once was in my opinion really good. Then we have the mission dark waters (oil rig), which i thoroughly enjoyed due to how the cqb plays out (no run-and-gun, more slower paced and methodical). and then the final mission which I thought was also pretty neat. In my opinion, it could've been better, but it was something a bit different, as you had an objective to complete while trying to hide and fight back against hassan.\n\n2. Multiplayer - easily one of the best multiplayers of the last few cods (yes, i understand OG cod is really good, but i'm talking about MW2019 and onward). the maps were alright, but I think the gunplay is what I really enjoyed (will get into it in the next point) the gamemodes were amazing. we had a co-op gamemode AND DMZ. the coop was something new, and I think honestly there should be more like it in the newer cods, as I enjoyed playing through it. being able to play as a team in a non-sweaty setting was very fun. DMZ was also something new. a softcore extraction shooter. it was something that they should've kept updating. being able to unlock weapons through DMZ gave you extra incentive to play. Not only that but it being a good way to level up your guns, as well as it just being fun in general through the side quests in the game, and the missions you take before you go in, made it really fun. it was completely different, something that no other COD had, which gave you another reason to buy the game, other than FOMO (fear of missing out).\n\n3. Gunplay - slower movement paired with lower TTK (time to kill) made the game less sweaty. people complained about campers, but I think a bigger problem with newer cods is these movement demons. it makes the game unplayable if people with no job have mastered the ability of running around you at light speed and using a finisher on you. the gunplay in this game made the possibility of that happening very unlikely. The game was also pretty beginner friendly (in my opinion atleast), because there wasn't too much of a learning curve, meaning that new players could get into the game and not die 80 times the instant they load into their first multiplayer game. the focus on realism, too, made it more fun. it wasn't a hyper-realistic tactical shooter, but it was a significant improvement than what came before (vanguard and coldwar- although, i did like coldwar's gunplay, it felt a little bit too arcade-like for me). although COD is an arcade shooter, it brought in a little bit of realism and made it into something new. it was something a little bit more serious in the era of nicki minaj and snoop dogg running around (which honestly i think people over-reacted at). the guns feel amazing to shoot, and the gunsmith, while complicated, was still (in my opinion) somewhat fair, while also being pretty detailed. an un-upgraded gun was still pretty usable, the upgrades (as the name suggests), made them better, but didn't transform them into a completely different gun (atleast from what i've seen). \n\n  \nTL;DR, MW2022 was a good game due to the campaign adding more unique missions, the multiplayer giving us new gamemodes, and the gunplay being less sweaty\n\n", "authorship": "human"}
{"Article Number": 775, "title": "You should probably be working in-office at least 3 days a week, and remote work is a disadvantage for many. ", "article": "I have the particularly odd experience of having worked in in-person environments, and for a few years in a very non-traditional field for a university graduate in Arts (think hard, outdoor labour), but almost all of my professional career has been working fully remotely. I'll put it this way; yes, I have seen the many advantages of working remotely, particularly for people with kids, but I think that for the average early-career professional, working 5 days a week in the office is better. In fact, I think that working fully remote in your early career is probably a career killer, to some degree. You simply don't maintain the same types of relationships when you work remotely. And in your early career, developing relationships that can benefit you in the long term (such as a mentor) is really crucial for giving you direction and guidance. \n\nI know that you're going to all say you can still develop these relationships online, and that's true, but I do believe there's something missing when you only do remote work. I think that Redditors will heavily underestimate the differences and advantages that come with organic interactions at work in person that don't exist when you always communicate by Zoom.\n\nAnd I think the one thing I really do believe that will be the most controversial is that there's something truly beneficial to you as an individual to being forced to wake up early, take care of your appearance, and commute, at least a bit. No, it isn't always amazing, but I think that forcing yourself to put in more effort creates a community of people more willing to put in that effort.

But then some of these same women will also act like a man so much as talking to, looking at or touching them the wrong way is a violation of their sacred chastity.\n\nNow look at the family court system. It's *still* set up as if women are totally helpless without men's money and personal property. I mean, we obviously know this isn't the case. And at the same time, we allow women to initiate a divorce because they just feel like it or \"aren't happy\". This no fault approach wS never part of the traditional structure.\n\nI think we've reached a point where feminists need to commit to one lane or the other. This cognitive dissonance needs to be called out. It's doing a lot of damage to both men and women.\n\n", "authorship": "human"}

This mythos has lasted and became embedded into the culture. Christmas movies have since followed or paid tribute to this mythos ever since. A person loses faith in humanity and becomes greedy and bitter. Through a supernatural or magical force the person is made to realize that the spirit of giving and generosity, empathy and gratitude over all else can overcome humanities struggles. This is embodied by Tiny Tim. \n\nIf you look at the all time great Christmas Movies this mythos is present. \n\n**The Grinch** is Scrooge, Cindy Who is Tiny Tim. \n\n**National Lampoons Christmas Vacation** : Clark's boss is scrooge and Clark is Tiny Tim. \n\n**Elf** : James Caan is scrooge and Will Farrell is Tiny Tim. \n\n**Office Christmas Party** : Jennifer Aniston is scrooge and TJ  Miller is Tiny Tim. \n\n\nCertain films can modify this concept but always include it.  For instance, It's a Wonderful Life. James Stewarts character is not Scrooge although he questions humanity. But Mr. Potter is Scrooge.  Tiny Tim is actually the Guardian Angel. \n\n**Christmas with the Kranks** has it.\n\n \n**The Holdovers** has it. \n\n**Trading Places**has it. \n\n**BAD SANTA** has it. \n\n\nbut **Die Hard** does NOT have it.  You could argue that Hans Gruber is the scrooge character but he isn't turned back to humanity by Bruce Willis. You could argue that Bruce Willis is scrooge but that would make Hans Gruber tiny tim?!?!?!   It doesn't make sense in the Christmas Mythos, and therefore is simply an action movie that takes place during the Holidays.   \n\nThe key clue is that the time of year plays no part in the plot of the film. It could take place any other time of year and still work. \n\nSidenote: Love Actually is also not a Christmas movie for the same reasons.", "authorship": "human"}

The way I see it is this. So many people have dietary restrictions for both religious and other reasons.\n\nFirst of all, as far as religious are concerned, so many kids have dietary restrictions here. For instance, Jews and Muslims are pescatarians except for Kosher or Halal food respectively. Or Hindus, who are often lacto vegetarians because that is their parents' faith. This is rightfully allowed because it's basic religious freedom to raise the kids under your faith. But also, it is basic freedom generally to raise kids under your values even if not religion based.\n\nAlso, there are other reasons for kids to eat a restricted diet. The biggest example I can think of is celiac. No bread, no pasta, usually no oatmeal, no crackers, no cookies, but somehow parents of kids with celiac are great and awesome but vegan parents are these demons? I don't think so. \n\nI kind of see veganism's morality as a middle ground. The case behind it is not strong enough where vegans have a right to claim that EVERYONE should be vegan but there are strong enough evidences that vegan diets can be healthy to the point I can be ok with people choosing it for themselves and their children.

{"Article Number": 27, "title": "Women don't care about male loneliness epidemic and that's okay ", "article": "Before I get to the point, I want to explain why I came to this opinion \n\nI recently watched a short on YouTube about a tiktoker who made a post \"IDGAF about male loneliness\". \n\nIt's a pretty condescending video where a woman made it about how women have it harder, how men need to grow thicker skin, how nobody cares about your feelings, how other men are the problem etc. Basically all the things that validates why men don't share their feelings with anyone (unironically also proving how it's not just other men who make fun of or weaponize men's emotions, the entire short was proof that some women do use men's emotions against them)\n\nShe basically goes into oppression olympics and says women have it harder but still persist and uses valid problems women experience to dismiss men's emotions all while having a smug look on her face. \n\nNow I explained the whole situation, let me elaborate my opinion formed. Watching some women's reaction to male loneliness epidemic, convinced me that women won't solve the male epidemic issue. \n\nBest solution to male loneliness epidemic is for men have deeper emotional connection with other men. The problem is men associate this deep emotional connection as gay or a sign of weakness. That should be removed. Men need to step up and actually take care of each other, men should be more emotionally supportive towards each other and be there for them when they need it. Have a more emotional brotherly bond, not shame your friends for being more feminine and such. \n\nBecause one thing I learned is that women are not good at solving men's problems because they simply don't understand it. They really don't get men's problems. So it shouldn't be their responsibility to help men solve men's problems. Before you say \"why should men care about women's problems then\" the thing is many men are just as dismissive as women, if not more dismissive sometimes. Women are taking care of their own issues, it's time men do the same for their own.\n\nBesides, do you really want a woman who is that dismissive and don't actually care to be involved with men's issues? \n\nYeah no, so I don't think women should be involved in this issue not should we expect them to be involved. Male loneliness epidemic is a problem that men should be able to handle themselves with the help of other men."}

I'm here to challenge those calls.\n\n\"Only US companies are allowed to steal your data!\" This is a common statement you'll see in defense of TikTok, while bits of it are true, it lacks a bit of nuance. There is a fundamental difference between a US company driven by profits selling your data vs a country driven by National interest having your data. The enemy you know vs the enemy you don't.\n\n\"All social media can be used to spread misinformation\" Yes, but again, most of that is driven by profit or engagement, not national intent. Even when political parties are themselves the one who do it, why allow 3rd party country a foothold in the space to make a bad situation worse?\n\nLet's say, hypothetically, China were to invade Taiwan. And with a snap, suddenly TikTok is spewing not pro-China messaging, but anti-Taiwan messaging. Typically America first influencers are suddenly anti-America world power? They say it's not our problem, the US is to blame for the war somehow and that we owe nothing to Taiwan to begin with. These ideas will spread to the mainstream and you'll have Fox News host going to Beijing talk about how sweet China is in comparison to the crumbling US.\n\n\"Western propaganda\" some of you may say, I would like to note this is literally what Russia has been doing since 2016, and especially since the start of the Ukraine/Russia war. https://www.npr.org/2024/09/07/nx-s1-5101895/doj-says-russia-paid-right-wing-influencers-to-spread-russian-propaganda\n\n\nAlso keep in mind, India, the country that's in BRICS, the country that should be, on paper anyway, one of China's closest allies, has also banned Tiktok, maybe having your geopolitical rival a foothold in your social media space can lead to consequences down the line.....maybe such reasoning is why US apps are banned China outright.\n\nSecondly, \"Why are we focusing on X company and not Y company?\" A good number of people who ask this seems to be completely unaware the DOJ is literally doing this already.\n\nThe DOJ a few months ago, was able prove in a court of law, that Google is a monopoly and was using monopoly powers to crush competition. The DOJ is now recommending that Google should be broken up and lose chrome. Even if you think this won't happen, the very idea of Google being legally considered a monopoly is unprecedented in the field of tech, not since Microsoft during the late 90s has something like this come up. And as the following video I'm linking shows, all tech companies are being hit with anti-trust suits. So no, the government is focusing on all tech companies.https://youtu.be/jx2dDV2eWBM?feature=shared\n\nPersonally, 50/50 on if TikTok should stay or not.

If you're an American you certainly have privilege over someone born in Somalia. Absolutely.\n\nBut if someone says \"I achieved this by years of hard diligent work\" their work ethic and other virtues imbued by a good upbringing do not make them \"privileged\" in the way it is used today: \"You can't even see your privilege.

In that sense you have *a* privilege, but you are not \"privileged\" in the common parlance of today.   Privilege in the modern parlance, as far as I'm describing here, is that sense of an unfair advantage.  The youngest partner in the history of the firm turns out that his dad is the founder? That's the parlance I'm referring to. \"Born on third base and thinks he hit a triple\" type of privilege.  Being a well-rounded person because your parents did a good job is NOT this type of privilege. \n\nThe post I saw that prompted this was full of people discounting the work required to become a cardiologist because not everyone has parents who instilled good virtuous work and study habits required. If I say \"Most people have a path to success if they apply themselves\", it's inappropriate to reply \"That's just privilege talking!

{"Article Number": 32, "title": "East Asian education systems are basically slavery ", "article": "\\* **All the information that I will present in this post came from various sources on the internet. I have read many articles about education systems in China, South Korea, and Japan before. I made this post because I care about students, parents, and teachers in East Asia. I want students, parents and teachers in East Asia to have human rights just like their counterparts in North America and Europe. I have nothing against the people of any East Asian country. Disagree with me if you want because this is a free country after all.** \n\nEast Asian Education systems are well known for being rigorous, demanding and stressful on students in East Asian countries. Many people tend to claim that this is simply due to Asian culture which empasiseses academic success. I throughly disagree with this claim. Based off the information I have gathered from reading about East Asian education, I think that East Asian education systems are they way they are because designed to produce exploitable economic tools for either large companies or the government. East Asian education systems are designed without any regard for the individualized abilities and rights of students because they are designed to make everyone into assets of the same quality. \n\nHere are all the problems with East Asian education systems that make me think that they are basically slavery\n\n\\- No regard for mental disabilities like Dyslexia, ADHD or Autism\n\n\\- No regard for the fact that every person has inherent individual strengths and weaknesses\n\n\\- No regard for the fact that every persons has a style of learning that works best for them\n\n\\- Entirely based on memorization/route learning\n\n\\- No critical thinking\n\n\\- No problem solving\n\n\\- No creativity\n\n\\- Excessive emphasis on obedience\n\n\\- Making academics completive as if they where a sport or competition\n\n\\- Extremely stressful environment\n\n\\- Excessive workload\n\n\\- Lack of motivation for students\n\n\\- Not instilling confidence in students\n\n\\- Coercing students to only pursue specific white collar careers instead of allowing them to pursue any career they want \n\n\\- Teachers abusing students for poor academic performance which they have little to no control over\n\nIn my opinion education in East Asia is like the enslavement of Jews by the Nazis or the ensalvement of Africans in pre-civil war America. In all three of these instances massive numbers of people are forced to work extremely hard in deplorable conditions for people who are more powerful than them, who give them little in return for their work, and who abuse them when they do not meet there egotistical expectations. All three of these instances are based on the idea of only viewing people who do work as assets and nothing else. The only thing that determines the value of people who work under slavery is there ability to meet there masters expectations which the master takes for granted.  \n\nSouth Korea and Japans education systems are designed to produce exploitable economic tools for the Chaebols and Keiretsus respectively. Chinas education system is designed to produce exploitable tools for the various greedy and unethical companies which work under the Chinese Communist Parties model of authoritarian capitalism. Taiwans education system is a remnant of the Japanese colonial era and the military dictatorship which has yet to be replaced with a normal ethical education system. Each East Asian countries education system is the way it is for different reasons but that does not change the fact that they violate human rights. \n\nIt's not just students who suffer from East Asian education system. Teachers also work in excessively stressful and abusive conditions. Teachers are treated by there bosses the same way they treat there students. East Asian education systems are a tiered system of mistreatment with the people in charge of teachers on the top and the students on the bottom. Each level in the system abuses the level beneath it. Many East Asian parents tend to be demanding, abusive, and entitled regarding there children's academic performance because there child's academic performance is one of the very few things in there lives which they can control. In East Asian countries, teachers and parents also do not have human rights and they utilize their students academic performance as a way to distract themselves from the fact that they do not have human rights. In addition many East Asian teachers are also underpaid (due to the greed of there employers) which is another fact of there lives that they distract themselves from with their students academic performance. \n\nEast Asian education systems do not give students better lives because the workforce in East Asian countries is just as slavery like as there education systems. In China, South Korea and Japan people work extremely long hours with no-breaks and only have one day off each week. Even if these students succeed in their education and get employed by white collar employers, they will not be able to spend the money they earn on anything they want because they simply won't have the time. Also the extremely intensive studying for the college entrance exams in East Asian education systems also causes physical and mental health issues which impair working ability. East Asian education systems are systems where students are educated in a manner where they are slaves and the job they are being forced to do is to memorize enough information to meet there teachers expectations. East Asian students are basically people who are being educated to be slaves because the work that they will be forced to do as slaves requires extensive education . There are no other instances in human history where slaves needed to be educated to do the work that their master forces them to do. In this sense education in East Asia is a step above historical instances of slavery like the Nazi enslavement of Jews or the enslavement of Africans in pre-civil war America. \n\nNorth America and Europe have proven that technological and economic progress can be made without education systems that work like slavery. If East Asian education systems where good as there supporters claim them to be then America would not have landed and man on the moon and Europe would not have made all of its progress in clean energy. Raw academic knowledge on its own will not enable actual innovation. Actual sci-tech innovation also requires critical thinking, problem solving and creativity alongside academic knowledge. It's also much easier for students to gain academic knowledge in environments that are not excessively stressful or abusive. All of the sci-tech progress made by East Asian countries is despite not because of there slavery like education systems. \n\nI hope that criticism of East Asian education systems becomes more widespread and well known. The injustices permeated by these slavery like education systems needs to be exposed to not just the public in East Asian countries but also the world. Education should be a part of life where people feel interested, motivated and respected. Slavery is does not instill interest, motivation or respect in students or anyone else involved in education. All education systems across the world should strive to unlock the different potentials in each person in a manner that adheres to human rights. "}

", "article": "To start, I understand that love is love and people are going to do what they want anyways.. \n\nHowever, I believe that given the increased importance of height in society, if you are a tall man who wants to have kids one day it’s in your best interest to also date women that are relatively close to your height. \n\nFor better or for worse height is becoming more important in society, and being tall provides advantages for so many aspects of life. Most people are meeting online now a days where height is being filtered. Social media sites are filled with people demonizing short men/talking about height, with women very openly expressing their preferences online and referring to tall men as “prime real estate”. \n\nHowever, a lot of these women who only date men significantly taller than them, and value a big “height difference”, go on to have sons with these men that are at heights they wouldn’t have deemed viable. \n\nThe estimated adult height of a boy is calculated by averaging the height of the father and adding 5” to the mother. For example, if the father is 6” and the mother is 5”7, the adult height of the boy should be 6”. \n\nThis isn’t always the case and there are outliers, how ever this average is calculated for a reason as it usually ends up being correct. \n\nI know a guy that’s 6”4 who was boasting about how he slept with a bunch of women over the last few months, and was bragging about all his matches. When I told him to remember the advantages his height gave him when settling down, he got upset and said that height doesn’t matter. The reality is that most of those women would not have swiped right on him if it wasn’t for how tall he is. \n\nI work with a guy that’s pretty tall that takes a lot of pride in his height. Even insulting other male coworkers for being “short”, when his finance is 5” tall. If they have a son together he likely will grow up to be shorter then him. \n\nYou might think this is an awful way to see dating and I agree. But unfortunately with the way we’re moving backwards as a society, it’s in your best interest to act accordingly. \n\nThe fact is, many of these women are only dating/were initially interested in these men based on their height, so therefore I think from an evolutionary standpoint it’s foolish to compromise that advantage for your offspring. \n\nI’m average height in my country (5”10), and for every one couple I see in public where the man is my height or shorter, I see at least 3-4 couples where the man’s at or over 6 feet. I’m decently taller then 80% of the women in these relationships. I’m hesitant to date a women under 5”5, and mostly date women closer to my height or taller. \n\nDoes my dating “preferences” contradict me talking about the importance height? Perhaps. But I would argue I am the exception and not the rule. Should these women I date not be doing “charity work” for dating a man under 6 feet? Perhaps. But that’s their decision and not mine. \n\nI may come off as bitter, jealous and having a fragile male ego, but the reality is that this stems from my observations of society around me. \n\nIn conclusion, people can do what they want as mentioned initially, however I believe dating shorter women as a tall man is a bad idea overall if you plan on having kids one day.

{"Article Number": 43, "title": "Anti victim blaming has gone too far", "article": "I used to think victim blaming just meant reducing the rapists moral/legal/social responsibility of the crime that they committed or lessening the victims victimhood status. I always have thought that is wrong and my opinion has not changed. But I learned recently that some consider much broader definitions, for example [link](https://www.sace.ca/learn/victim-blaming/) which includes this line: “It’s questioning people who experience violence — especially sexual violence — about their actions, and what they could have done to prevent it….” This extends victim blaming to analyzing violence to identify defenses and educating people on those defenses. Shaming this leads to more people getting assaulted. \n\nI also realize there is a time and place for this victim blaming. But this is an issue of unwanted advice which is usually simply rude and in the case of traumatic experiences is extremely insensitive. Telling a victim who wasn’t looking for advice what they could have done better in their personal situation is not acceptable. However, I recently found out that even a victim discussing what safety measures could be taken to try and educate others on safety is seen by some as victim blaming and is worthy of vitriolic personal attacks.\n\nMy opinion is that either the definition needs to be narrower, or we have to say victim blaming is a moral good when it comes to responsibly investigating and educating about safety measures. Telling others that if they want to be safe, they could take self defense classes, that they could make sure their doors are locked, that they could not be alone with people who have not earned a lot of trust is educating people on safety, not putting meaningful blame on the victim. Someone who does not do any of those steps does not deserves assault at all any more than someone who does all of them. But you can educate on safety without saying or implying that.\n\nSome of the counter arguments: \n\n1. People already know how to be safe: Any information about safety is either speculative or was learned by people looking at these violent acts and determining what worked and did not work. This fits under the broader definition of victim blaming. So no victim blaming means no building on or updating this information other than through speculation.\n\n2. We should tell potential offenders not to assault people instead as they are the morally responsible ones: Sure but this is a societal solution and you can simultaneously have a societal solution (political/cultural) that you advocate for politically and personal solution that you use to reduce your risk if you choose to. Not mutually exclusive with my view.\n\n3. Some victims did everything and still got assaulted: Safety is never guaranteed, it is about probabilities. I would never say that advocating to have a lock on your front door sucks because a bank had a full vault and someone still figured out how to crack that vault.\n\n4. The very discussion is traumatic to victims: And we have safe spaces for victims to heal, building on those seems like the correct solution to this problem. This does not mean the whole public discussion should be changed."}

And the world would be a better place if more women looked at that as a positive thing instead of casting it aside immediately. \n\nThere are so many men out there who are legitimately great people and are so lonely they are literally deteriorating. I’ve been seeing it with my own eyes the past 10 years or so. Women won’t even look their way. And these are relatively attractive, well put together, kind men. \n\nResearch has shown us loneliness can harm people’s health both mentally AND physically. For as much as women don’t owe men their love or attention, I also know some of these good men do not deserve their health to be at risk from loneliness. I’ve seen men fall into deep depression, lose job opportunities, and fail to advance in life because (in my opinion) they don’t have the wind at their backs that is a supportive, loving partner.

Im just putting this out there for consideration. \n\nThere are men out there that just one relationship could change their entire lives. Just feeling human. \n\nAnd you should give them a chance.

I felt he was mentally inept, he wasn't true to his word, botched COVID, and, with the majority of my family in the military, they and I believe he really messed up the pullout. I didn't agree with many of his approaches across various policies and believe he just fueled the divide.\n\nThe last month or so, though, I finally feel a little better about him generally, and I think it's because he finally just gave the middle finger to the Democratic Party.\n\n* He got pushed out after winning the nomination, and I think they brought a lot of Republicans to a level of sympathy for him. Additionally, for four years, we felt it was almost terrible to have him out there given his mental state. When they pushed him out, it validated all those feelings, where I went from distaste to sympathy.\n* Throughout the election, he would undermine Kamala, and it was kind of refreshing to see him just be himself and say what he means instead of being a puppet.\n* He said recently he thinks he could have beaten Trump, which is like a \"F\\*ck you\" to the Dems.\n* He admitted he couldn't have served four more years because of his health, and there is something to the fact that he finally admitted, \"Yeah, I am old, and I don't have it; you are right.\"\n* Biden pardoned his son, which, even though I think it was wrong and means he just blatantly lied, also fueled Republicans' belief that the justice system is weaponized, so everything against Trump doesn't matter. But it also humanized him, as he did it because it is his son and he is a father.\n* Then yesterday was the one that made me really think Biden is alright: when the ceasefire happened in Israel, Biden went out of his way to say the peace was implemented and pulled off thanks to Trump's team. He obviously said his team was in negotiations, but he specifically said the peace deal was \"implemented by Trump.\" I respect that he gave credit to the incoming president, especially on such a major issue, and I KNOW the Dems DID NOT want him to say that, as it basically boosts Trump majorly as the peacemaker."}

The latter is the divinely-inspired king judging everything on a case-by-case basis and what 'feels' correct, with no concern about inconsistencies or predictable outcomes based on actions.\n\nI know everyone will say that the reversal of Roe v Wade was a political decision, but answer me this: why didn't they reinterpret the Constitution to grant fetuses personhood status, thus ensuring they have the same rights as newborns? I'm sure the 6 justices who voted to overturn Roe would all prefer a nationwide ban on abortion, or, at the very least, for abortion to be illegal everywhere (even if they aren't a fan of the federal government's involvement). And yet they didn't do that; all they did was overturn abortion as a Constitutionally protected *right*, allowing states to set their own laws about abortion.\n\nThe reason for that is obvious. Because Roe v Wade was bad law. It was bad law because it was a set of judges attempting to legislate what they think is good, rather than defining what the Constitution says. The Supreme Court's job is not to achieve good ends, except insofar as following the Constitution is a good end. If the Constitution enables or guarantees bad, it is the job of legislatures to write new laws (if the Constitution does not guarantee/prohibit something that legislators believe should be guaranteed/prohibited) or new constitutional amendments (if the Constitution guarantees/prohibits something that legislators believe should not be guaranteed/prohibited).\n\nIf you look at Supreme Court rulings, the so-called 'right wing' justices are much more likely to rule against their own personal beliefs of what the law *should* be and in favor of what the law *is*, while the left wing justices are almost guaranteed to interpret the law in the exact same way that they would choose to write the law if they were legislators.\n\nSo yes, the court is political, but only insofar as one half's political beliefs inhibit them from judicial activism, while the other half's political beliefs expressly encourage them to be legislate from the bench. A court of 9 right wing justices would not result in a right wing country, but a court of 9 left wing justices almost certainly would."}
{"Article Number": 72, "title": "In the case of crimes, particularly DV and SA, police and DAs prefer to have less evidence, as more could lead an into believing there’s reasonable doubt. ", "article": "As we know, there are tons and tons of cases where people get convicted on testimony alone in the absence of any physical or circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is essentially evidence that the crime happened at all. And physical evidence includes circumstantial evidence but also evidence of the perpetrator (ie fingerprints or camera footage).\n\nTechnically, any crime can leave physical evidence and even more will leave some form of circumstantial evidence. However, cops don't want such evidence at all. \n\nSee here's the thing. Cops know that DAs,judges, and juries in the absence of a large amount of evidence will throw reasonable doubt out the window and instead just lean towards who they believe more. \n\nWith conflicting testimonies, people can't grasp reasonable doubt. They will end up voting for what they believe more. I think particularly in crimes involving victims, juries have a tough time with the reasonable doubt standard due to their emotions. They go to a default of believing the alleged victim and de facto it turns into a guilty until proven innocent scenario. \n\nAlso, it doesn't help that the alleged victim's testimony de facto carries much more weight compared to the accused, though there is absolutely no legal basis for this.\n\nWhen physical evidence gets involved, now, people are able to be more objective with it. People are more open to the idea that a specific piece of physical evidence does not lead to the accused than they are that the alleged victim's testimony is false. \n\nPeople are likely to think more critically and uphold the standard of reasonable doubt, when they have circumstantial and/or physical evidence alongside testimony than they would just with testimony alone. \n\nSo, DAs and prosecutors wouldn't exactly want any evidence outside of testimony at all. They know that in such a case they know that juror and judge emotions are much easier to manipulate than it would be with more evidence."}

{"Article Number": 87, "title": "Yes, Taka is a villain. But its not entirely his fault.", "article": "In the new 'Mufasa' movie, a prequel to 'The Lion King' live action remake, we learn the backstory of Mufasa and Taka (Scar).\n\nIn this movie we learn that Taka is the prince (and future king) of a small pride of lions. He rescues a young Mufasa who was separated from his pride by a flood.\n\nWe learn that Taka's pride is massacred by a group of outsider lions, Mufasa is tasked with protecting Taka until he can build a pride of his own.\n\nThroughout the movie, Taka saves Mufasa's life multiple times.\n\nDuring this journey, the two young males also meet Sarabi, a princess of a neighbouring pride (who eventually becomes Mufasa's mate and they have Simba).\n\nThere is no exact point at which Taka becomes a villain. It is a rhetoric that is ingrained in him since he was born. His father coaxes his entitlement.\n\n**Obasi, Taka's father, does not allow Taka to associate with the females of the pride. He claims that Taka is too good to hunt with the females, that he is the future of the pride and his bloodline must be protected. He instils an understanding that Taka is entitled to rule. (Mufasa, and outcast, is allowed to hunt with the females and thus fosters a better understanding of the struggles of the females of the pride).\n\nSo, when Sarabi is introduced, Taka falls in love, and his entitlement (fueled by his father's teachings) for a relationship with Sarabi grows. To the point where he convinces Mufasa to lie about who saved Sarabi during a stampede to make himself look better (among other things like recognising the scent of flowers on her coat).\n\nMufasa, being loyal to his brother, obeys. And it wasn't until Sarabi confronted him with evidence that he told the truth.\n\nMufasa, having had experience with interacting with female lions since his youth, is more comfortable speaking with Sarabi and they bond more quickly. Taka is not so lucky, as his father's commands meant he was unable to develop any meaningful communication skills with the females of his pride, he struggles to bond with Sarabi.\n\n**Still, Taka feels entitled to Sarabi because of his understanding that his destiny is to be king, and kings choose their mates. But, what Takas father failed to teach him is that a King without a pride is nothing, no other pride will recognise a solitary male as a king. So for a king to come from nothing, he must earn it.\n\nNow, whilst Taka does save Mufasa multiple times, he also repeatably shows himself as a coward.\n\nMufasa, on the other hand, repeatably defends others and shows little cowardace.\n\n(Many people site that Taka saved Mufasa multiple times and whilst there were few incidences where Mufasa protected Taka, there were many demonstrations of Mufasa protecting other lions such as Sarabi and Taka's mother, despite terrible odds)\n\nWhen Sarabi declared her love for Mufasa and her disinterest in Taka, Taka takes this as the last straw of \"things he's lost\" (despite Sarabi never being his to claim) and betrayed Mufasa by leading the lions that massacred his own family to Mufasa so they could have revenge on him for killing the prince of their pride (who Mufasa killed in defense of Taka's mother - Taka fled this fight instead of helping his mother and adopted brother, he didn't even go to get help, he just ran away).\n\nAlthough Taka ultimately changes his mind and saves Mufasa again, he still goes on to spend the rest of his life plotting to reclaim the throne (and Sarabi in turn).\n\n**TL;TR:\nTakas entitlement, fueled by Obasi's teachings, is what ultimately led Taka to villainhood.\n\nAnd that's not inherently Taka's fault. That's Obasi's fault for raising Taka under the assumption that he would always have the witness of the rest of the pride to speak for his claim to royalty.\n\nObasi never thought to raise his child to prepare for a world where he does not have the privilege of family to back up his claim to a throne.\n\nNot only this, but Obasi instils that Taka is somehow more entitled to becoming a king than the royalty of any other neighbouring pride displaced by the outsiders that killed Obasi's pride."}

The review of academic works and empirical data on that matter only allow us to say that the likelyness of a social media user to be ideologically isolated in an echo chamber depends mostly on the user's media consumtion practices and the plateforms they use. \n\n\"There are a number of areas where our review suggests that there is a clear \nmajority view in academic research, including most notably: \n\n● Politically partisan online news echo chambers are generally small – much smaller than is often assumed in public and policy debate. \n\n● Automated serendipity and incidental exposure mean that relying on search engines, social media, and other digital platforms using algorithmic ranking leads people to slightly more diverse news – the opposite of what the filter bubble hypothesis posits. \n\n● Self-selection, both along partisan lines and, importantly, in terms of levels of interest, plays a significant role in shaping news and media use. \n\n● There is no single uniform trend towards greater polarisation – ideological polarisation has declined in some countries, affective polarisation has increased, news audience polarisation varies greatly, and in every case, country-specific factors seem decisive, not a single global trend like the rise of the internet. \n\n● Elite cues continue to play an important role in shaping both news coverage And public opinion, with the behaviour of political parties and individual prominent politicians often contributing to polarisation, whether around Ideological issues or science issues such as climate change. \n\nGiven the amount of research on these issues arriving at broadly similar conclusions, the burden of proof now, in our view, is on those arguing for \nalternative interpretations to provide systematic evidence. \"\n\nhttps://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:6e357e97-7b16-450a-a827-a92c93729a08\n\nThe second point I wanna tackle is the idea that Reddit is a worse plateform than twitter or others social media because it's a bigger echo chamber. \n\nAccording to this study it's quite the opposite, information diffusion is less biaised on Reddit than it is on twitter or facebook. \n\n\"These results indicate that information diffusion is biased toward individuals who share a similar leaning in some social media, namely Twitter and Facebook.

You explain your reasoning thoroughly, but they ignore everything you’ve said and respond with something like, \"Just bla bla bla, simple. No need to overcomplicate. \". \n\nHere is a concrete example:\n\n**Me:** \"If we’re talking about sugar in the context of health, there are two categories of sugar to be aware of: simple sugars and complex sugars. You shouldn’t consume more than 36g of simple sugar in a day, but for complex sugars, it’s okay to eat more, as long as you’re mindful of the calories. Simple sugars are found in beverages, processed foods, etc., while complex sugars are found in fruits, rice, and similar foods. However, fruit juice should be counted as simple sugar because it’s just as damaging. In fact, we don’t need simple sugar at all.\"\n\n**The Typical:** \"Why can’t you just say sugar is bad? Simple and easy to understand.\"\n\nThen, they proceed to stop eating all kinds of sugar, rice, corn, pasta—anything with carbohydrates—and later blame \"science\" for making them sick. In reality, they are the ones who oversimplified the information, misunderstood it, and hurt themselves because of it.\n\nNext, they do a 180 flip. Since \"science\" supposedly hurt them, they turn to their like-minded peers to echo the sentiment that \"science is bad.\" Now, they go to the opposite extreme: eating all kinds of sugar without moderation. Over time, they gain additional weight and develop long-term health issues from consuming too much simple sugar.\n\nThe reality is, some concepts simply can’t be simplified without losing crucial details. It’s not complicated by choice—it’s complicated by necessity. Most things in life are not that simple.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Another Example:**  \n**Me:** \"The news is very biased. If you only listen to one side, it can brainwash you into siding with them.\"  \n**Context:** I’m talking to someone who ONLY watches Chinese media and believes China is the leader in space travel.  I'm not against China, but this is simply not true.\n\n**Them:** \"But this is international news—it’s available to everyone. They can’t lie, or there would be consequences. Everyone can see it. They wouldn’t lie.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Outright lying isn’t the only way they can manipulate you. There are many ways. For instance, they can only report their successes while showing only the failures of others. This creates the illusion that their side is winning, even though the reality could be the opposite. For example, if China highlights two of its successful launches but hides ten failures, while only reporting two U.S. failures and ignoring ten U.S. successes, you’re going to think China is ahead. But in reality, it’s just cherry-picking data. No one holds them accountable for this because they technically didn’t lie. They just omitted information to create a narrative. You can’t sue a media outlet for omitting details. And even if someone calls them out for it, you wouldn’t know, because you only get information from them.\"\n\n**Them:** They refuse to comprehend and keep repeating: \"But it’s international news. Everyone can see it. If they do anything bad, there would be consequences. They wouldn’t do that.\"\n\n**Me:** In disbelief, I try another example: \"Another way they could manipulate is by presenting allegations as if they were convictions. For instance, anyone could falsely accuse you of rape—\"\n\n**Them:** They cut me off. \"DON’T say someone might sue me for that. It’s negative! Blah blah blah.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Okay, let’s say it’s John. If someone hates John, they could arrange for a false accusation of rape. The media could title it, 'John Alleged to Have Sexually Abused a College Student.' Most people don’t care about 'innocent until proven guilty.' They’ll assume it’s true just from the headline. The majority of the population actually behave this way. Just look at Johny Dep; you're probably one as well.\n\n**Them:** \"Nah, they wouldn’t do that.\"\n\n**Me:** got mad, and start explaining it in obvious way.  \nThem: \"Why can't you just simply say the news outlet is fake\".  \nMe: BUT IT's NOT FAKE, OMG.   \n  \nThey simplify \"News can manipulate you\" into two extremes:\n\n1. \"News won’t lie because there’s accountability.\"\n2. \"News is fake, so never trust any news.\"\n\nReality is far more nuanced. The media often uses omission, selective reporting, and framing to manipulate narratives without technically lying. This isn’t \"complicating\" the issue—it’s acknowledging how manipulation works in practice. And the solution isn't to completely trust the news or completely ignore the news. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nAnother:  \n**Them:** \"Complicated math is useless outside of school.\"  \n**Me:** \"It depends on what you do! If you’re flipping burgers, playing sports, working as a lawyer, or in some subsets of business and other professions, then yes, it’s useless because you’re not going to use it. But for those interested in fields like engineering, computer science, and similar areas, this math isn’t anywhere near useless—it’s foundational. The same people who claim math is useless are never the ones designing airplanes, creating games, building bridges blueprints, or tackling complex engineering marvels.\"\n\n**Them:** \"But I’ve never had to use it, and I’m still doing fine.\"  \n**Me:** \"I know, and that’s because you’re not interested in a field that requires it. But you’re assuming that everyone’s goal is just to be 'doing fine.' What about people who are passionate about fields that depend on advanced math and want to work in those areas? If they take your advice, they’re screwed.\"\n\nThem: \"Well, just don't do those job, only money matter anyway, simple and easy to understand\".  \n\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThere’s so much more I could say, but the point is that when you simplify something, you’re inevitably dropping important details. That’s literally the only way to simplify.\n\nAnd don’t hit me with the quote, *\"If you can’t explain it to a 5-year-old, you don’t really understand it.\"* That’s complete nonsense. You absolutely can’t explain something like general relativity to a 5-year-old without skipping 90% of the details that make it functional.\n\nIf you think you understand general relativity, try simplifying it for a 5-year-old. You’ll quickly realize that what you’re presenting isn’t the real thing—it’s a dumbed-down version. People often mistake understanding a simplified version for understanding the actual concept. But knowing a watered-down explanation is not the same as truly understanding the full complexity.\n\nNow, as for the title, Simplifying complex ideas is not smart, it's the opposite. \n\nI said that because people often mistake the ability to simplify as something \"smart.\" It’s not. Simplifying is the easy part—you just omit all the details, and things become simple. That’s how most people do it, and they get praised for it. But it’s easy to do that.\n\nWhat’s hard is actually tackling the problem head-on and being willing to dig through all the nuance. That’s the smart part—being critical and thoughtful rather than a simpleton. Simplifying is easy because all you’re doing is omitting details.\n\nFor example:\n\n* It's much easier to say \"Don't eat sugar\" or \"It's okay to eat sugar\" rather than explain that there are different kind of sugar. \n* It's much easier to say \"The news is fake\" or \"The news is not fake\" rather than to explain how news can manipulate you and how you can resist it. \n* It's much easier to say \"Math is useless\" or \"Math is useful\" rather than explaining how it's subjective to individual. \n* It’s much easier to say, \"John stole because he’s a bad person,\" than to say, \"John stole. His action is wrong, but there might be a reason for it—maybe he was desperate. This doesn’t justify it, but understanding the reasoning helps.\"\n* It’s much easier to say, \"Women and men are the same,\" than to say, \"There are areas where women are better than men and areas where men are better than women. We are generally different, but we all deserve the same rights, opportunities, and treatment.\"\n* It’s much easier to say, \"You hate Black people, so you’re racist,\" than to say, \"You’re not racist. You hate John because he stole from you, and he happens to be Black. It’s not about his skin color; it’s about his actions. You would hate anyone who did that, regardless of race.\"\n\nAs you can see, simplifying things is easy. It’s not a \"smart\" skill—it’s the opposite, because it involves omitting important details. When people choose not to simplify something, it’s not because they can’t; it’s because they value accurate information and don’t want to leave out essential details. You inability to comprehend complex idea, doesn't mean your \"simplify\" everything trait is smart. "}

A subsidy is when the government gives the tax payer's money to a business (in this case, animal farmers) to prop it up.\n\nThese subsidies could instead finance cheap and healthy foods. For example, bananas, peanut butter, bread, rice and beans could become even cheaper with subsidies. This would help low income families afford food, because things like bananas would cost next to nothing (they are already pretty cheap). This would also reduce the need for programs like food stamps, because even if you make minimum wage, 5 cents bananas are not expensive. We would end up in a situation without food insecurity and without government bureaucracy to waste money on who gets benefits and who does not.\n\nIn addition, many people have ethical problems with the meat industry. Climate conscious people often try to limit their meat consumption, yet they are forced to use their money to increase emissions. Vegetarians who abstain from meat due to ethical concerns about animal rights (myself included) are also included in this group. Think about an industry that you find morally disgusting. How would you feel if the government forced you to pay taxes to help it stay alive?\n\nTLDR: meat subsidies could be used to ensure everyone can afford food and people should not be forced to contribute to something they dislike."}

{"Article Number": 109, "title": "The \"TikTok refugees on Xiaohongshu / RedNote\" narrative being pushed on both platforms and MSM right now is massively overhyped", "article": "So I'm Chinese American, I've been able to read Chinese since I was 3, and I began using RedNote (Xiaohongshu) a whole year ago. And I have to say, RedNote makes for a pretty unusual option for a TikTok substitute.\n\n- The user experience is much closer to something like Instagram than TikTok: you scroll down a whole menu of posts, the posts don't take up the entire screen, and the nature of the content aligns more closely with what you'd find on Instagram or Pinterest than on either TikTok or China's version of TikTok (Douyin).\n\n- There are other apps out there like Meta's Instagram Reels or Google's YouTube Shorts that provide the same (or better) functionality and even content, but aren't owned by China and therefore avoid the same security concerns (however valid you believe they are) as ByteDance. Like, why promote another Chinese app as the de facto \"canonical\" TikTok clone if there's a very good chance that either a)  the US government uses the same legislation to ban it in turn too, or b) the Chinese government decides to segregate the app into a walled-off ID-required version for their own citizens, and a more \"open\" one for foreigners... which is exactly how Douyin and TikTok respectively have operated?\n\n- No offense, but the design of RedNote is absolutely horrid compared to any of the others. A lot of the features aren't even functional, you're forced to select from a tiny predetermined music library, and hashtags are so buggy when trying to input English (Latin)-alphabet tags that for a while I didn't even know using them was possible. Furthermore, almost all the information is in Chinese, and I'd wager only a small fraction of TikTok's userbase speaks or understands that language (though it's great that people are trying to learn!)\n\n- Many (albeit not all) of the recent \"hi, I am a TikTok refugee from the US\" posts on RedNote are written in far inferior English than what I'd typically expect from Americans who use TikTok. I did a little scrutinization to see if any of the ones I saw were Chinese users mocking Americans, while unlike (non-Chinese) TikTok and Instagram but standard for Chinese social media, users are automatically marked with their country of residence (or province if in China), most of the posts in question do indeed indicate US provenance, but then again, location should be fairly easy to spoof if you've got an agenda on your hands. (They're also often fairly basic in quality, especially compared to TikToks, but that could be chalked to the aforementioned limitations of the platform's editor.)\n\nThere are so many confusing questions, and to me, a lot of this just simply doesn't add up. What I think could be happening is that the TikTokers jumping ship to RedNote represent only a specific subset of users whose parents, relatives, or close (IRL) friends might use RedNote out of familiarity with the platform and the Chinese language, and it's catching on to the general TikTok userbase in much smaller proportions than all those news articles are ready to admit (with most of the \"normies\" just heading over to YouTube Shorts or Instagram Reels, if they weren't there already).\n\nI'm also willing to consider the possibility that it's some government that could be behind this, but I'm just not sure which. If it's the US government, then why would they make a big fuss over one Chinese app only to prop up another? And if it's the PRC (or Russian, etc.) government, then why would they be so keen on letting foreign TikTokers - their own \"brainwashing\" victims, if you believe this, though I don't, which is another story - roam free on what generally tend to be walled-off spaces on the Chinese internet?"}

This isn’t about “local, ethical farming.” It’s about the actual system most people are funding: mass cruelty hidden behind clean packaging.\\*\\* \\*\\*The view I’m asking to be challenged is that animals are just meat. That’s what we’ve been convinced to view them as by the meat industry. We've been conditioned to believe it's okay for them to suffer in cruel conditions their whole lives because, in the end, they're just products for us to consume.\\*\\*\n\n\n\nI saw an Instagram video of a cow moments before slaughter. The most-liked comments were: \"That's kinda sad, but boy do I love burgers.\" \"The cow knows its purpose.\" \"I'll eat double the meat so the same number of animals die.\"\n\nHow do we rationalize cruelty so casually? People see a scared animal and joke about it. We’re completely desensitized to suffering — because it’s easier that way.\n\nThe meat industry has done a great job of conditioning us to see animals as products. They show us clean packaging, happy farm animals in commercials, and sell us meat as \"just food.\" It’s easy to pretend nothing suffered in the process. That an animal lived, suffered a horrible life, and was slaughtered for that steak or burger. We just don't want to think about it.\n\nAnd that’s why we make excuses: “I know it’s sad, but I love eating meat.” “I’m just one person, what difference can I make?” “It’s normal. Everyone does it.”\n\nThese are the same types of excuses people made to justify past atrocities.\n\n* During slavery, people convinced themselves it was normal because the economy relied on it.\n* During slavery, people convinced themselves that slaves were born to serve, that it was their only purpose in life.\n* During genocides, people turned a blind eye because it didn’t directly affect them.\n\nExcuses make us feel like we're not bad people. We don’t want to feel guilty. We don’t want to change our habits. So, instead of confronting the truth of our actions, we attack the people who hold up a mirror to us.\n\n\\[EDIT\\] \\*\\*I’m not equating animal agriculture with slavery or genocide. What I’m highlighting is how, throughout history, people have justified cruelty by viewing others as less valuable. We do the same with animals to make it easier to accept practices that cause them suffering\\*\\*\n\nNo one likes being reminded that their actions cause suffering. So we make jokes, dismiss activists as annoying, or label them as extremists. It’s easier than **admitting we’re complicit.** That’s cowardice. **We are cowards.**\n\n**We look back at history and wonder, “How could people allow slavery? How could they let genocide happen?” The answer is always the same: People justified it. They told themselves it was normal. They convinced themselves they weren’t to blame.**\n\nMost people know, deep down, that the way animals are treated in our current meat industry is horrific. But instead of facing it, they make excuses because it’s easier. If you think you’d never have stood by during slavery or genocide, ask yourself why you’re standing by now."}

I myself was starting to fall victim into the hate spiral, feeling no hope and that shit was just gonna get worse and worse.  But as I was watching a news story about the LA fires, I saw strangers, even in their crisis, help out other strangers for no reason other than to help.  Hell, even strangers on Reddit reach out and ask to chat to people they will never even met to help them out during a hard time. \n\nI won’t sugar coat it, the world IS in a dark time and times ARE tough. I have seen horrors, I have been through abuse and seen violence first hand, me and my loved ones have been through hell ourselves. We are so depressed because we think that’s all there is at times. However, I know the world is kind, because in spite of everything, I am kind. "}

They literally auto moderate posts that include anything regarding Tiananmen square, Chinese mistreatment of Uyghur Muslims and other general anti-CCP rhetoric. I think much of it has to do with the anti-Trump, pro-Palestine stance much of TikTok has adopted. However, I feel that's just the CCP indirectly projecting its own geopolitical interests upon western citizens. Yet somehow vast amounts of leftist's support banning/regulating sites like X and 4chan on the basis of “hate speech”.  \n\nThe double standard is hilarious when the left supported Brazil banning X; then later became outraged after the US considered a TikTok ban. I think the root cause of the issue is leftists wanting echo-chambers. The idea of migrating to a site like X after a TikTok ban and having to deal with someone whom may have a different opinion simply infuriates them. It somewhat stems from TikTok being a very politically-sheltered platform when it comes to leftists not having to deal with conservative/alt-right opinions.

{"Article Number": 174, "title": "Computer Science is the worst major you could choose.", "article": "Hey everyone, I just wanted to share an opinion on college majors and career paths. **Don’t major in Computer Science.** After you graduate with a computer science degree, it can be nearly impossible to get a job. This is because the field is oversaturated. Everyone and their grandparent is trying to get a job in computer science because of one thing: \"MONEY.\" . I majored in English, and I don’t regret it. I am in debt, but the reality is that I’m probably never going to pay it off in my lifetime. Who cares right? I went to college for the experience and to improve my writing skills.\n\nI believe an English major is better than a computer science major for three reasons:\n\n1. English teaches you communication skills and helps you become better at arguments.\n2. Language and Liberal Arts degrees are typically easier, less stressful, and less competitive than STEM degrees.\n3. Finally, the ROI (Return on Investment) isn’t very good these days.\n\nCommunication is very important, both on a casual and a professional level. You’d be surprised how many new grads in Gen Z have poor communication skills. If you read a job application, almost all of them require excellent verbal and written communication skills. These are skills that can be developed through public speaking and liberal arts classes. You might argue that English is a universal language, which is true, but you would be surprised by how many immigrants and people who come to the U.S. don’t speak English well. Developing strong communication skills can set you apart from other applicants.\n\nThere are current trends and studies suggesting that Gen Z is reading below grade level. Back in the 70s and 60s, 70% of children were reading books; now, that number has dwindled down to about 15%. This shift is due to kids spending too much time on electronics, and it will have a major impact on the workforce.\n\nI get it—difficulty is subjective. What I find difficult, you might not, and vice versa. There are many studies showing that many STEM degrees have a higher dropout rate compared to liberal arts majors. Also, grades in STEM fields are often curved, which means they depend on how the entire class does. Curving grades can create an unhealthy competitive environment, which isn’t ideal. I know that some non-STEM areas of study also have curved grades, but it’s much more common in STEM fields.\n\nROI is important when choosing a college major, and in my opinion, STEM degrees generally have a poor ROI. I know someone who happens to be my brother’s older cousin’s friend. He graduated from MIT with a computer science degree. He paid about $80K a year for his degree, had a few scholarships, but after graduating, he found himself $270K in debt. That’s not ideal. He will likely never pay it off unless he wins the lottery. The same can be true for most computer science degrees—even if you go to a state school, you could end up with over $80K in debt if you're not careful.\n\nJust a bonus reason for you folks: English and language arts majors have more job opportunities. You could become a teacher or a writer, which can earn a good amount of money. The chances of becoming the next J.K. Rowling are higher than you might think, if you consider the statistics and perform the calculations. Most importantly, an English degree can set you up for law school.\n\nFinal verdict: Stay away from computer science. It’s too hard, and it won’t help you “get women” in college or in real life. You’ll probably end up depressed in your dorm room, smoking weed and possibly even resorting to harder substances trying to finish projects. Most importantly, college isn’t just about getting a job—it’s about getting an education. There's a difference, folks. At the end of my English class, we watched a movie. How cool is that? In computer science, they just give you boring tests.\n\nI’ve noticed that many computer science majors can be rude, and they often think they’re better than others. But in reality, most of them are pretty dumb and lame.\n\nTLDR; Major in liberal arts not computer science"}

Health insurance shouldn't even need to be a thing! Everyone being forced to have health insurance doesn't help the issue, but those that set the cost of care are the problem. \n\nIf medicines and procedures were less expensive then I have no doubt that insurance companies would cover more things and/or people would pay their own medical costs without trouble. \n\nI think a way to do that (at least as far as medication goes) is to put all medications and medical discoveries made with government money in the US public domain (or whatever country is providing the tax dollars. I'm from the US so my government). That would cause the prices to drop like a rock. We the people are the ones paying for these so in my mind we the people bought access to it.\n\nThis would also increase the transparency when it comes to what is put in the medications and why. No more finding a cure and then turning it into a weaker form to only keep the illness at bay to keep people as permanent customers. No more adding sketchy/unnecessary ingredients without telling people why. No more hiding any long term side effects. No more hiding research from the public at all. We paid for it, we should have access to all of it.\n\nIf they want to keep the rights to their discoveries, then they can fund the research themselves. Without the governments help. \n\nAnd once prices are down people wouldn't need to worry about medical costs nearly as much and health insurance could be used for actual big medical emergencies like surgeries rather than paying for everyday medications."}

{"Article Number": 180, "title": "California (and all other states) should not receive federal aid for natural disasters...", "article": "Natural Disasters like the wildfires California is experiencing or Hurricane Helene earlier this year are fundamentally predictable events. No one knows exactly when or where, but it is certain that California will experience more wildfires and Florida will experience more hurricanes, especially as global warming exacerbates these climatic consequences. Considering this, states and localities should bear the burden of planning for and repairing the damage from these circumstances.\n\nIt is fundamentally unfair that people who live in more safe and sustainable regions of the country must subsidize the dangerous development patterns of those who choose to live in disaster-prone areas. It is also short-sighted because it incentivizes less resilient settlement patterns, meaning more people are harmed and displaced by disasters in the future. Many people affected by recent disasters likely wouldn't have been there and therefore would not have suffered in the first place if the risks were appropriately priced--both California and Flordia have kept home insurance artificially low for years. Or their homes wouldn't have been destroyed because the proper pricing of insurance would effectively necessitate more durable designs.\n\nTo the extent the federal government provides any aid for predictable natural disasters, it should either be as a loan to smooth out the cost shock or as an insurance plan individual states buy into which is calibrated to its region's risk level. We already intuitively understand this as fair for quasi-predictable events that affect individuals: the federal government doesn't come running to buy you a new house if you neglect to buy homeowners insurance and a pipe bursts, flooding it. For healthcare, too, we either expect individuals to buy personal insurance plans or, in countries with universal/public coverage, negative externalities on risky consumption are appropriately taxed to offset its societal cost (eg taxes on alcohol, tobacco, fat, sugar etc.).\n\nWhere I do think the federal government should offer aid is for disasters/emergencies that are truly unforeseen like a meteor strike or a terror attack. Otherwise, it is doing more harm than good to promote reckless population growth in the most disaster-prone regions of the country."}

At the same time, note also that if you were raised poorly, any unfamiliar situation is going to inherently feel weird. Your \"intuition\" is going to paint unfamiliarity as bad. Let's also acknowledge that with a 50% divorce rate, most of your intuition(s) are collectively, not that spectacular \n\n\\-Discomfort: Going off of what I just said, if you're uncomfortable, that isn't inherently a bad thing if you're living a shitty life.

It doesn't matter how many positive interactions with a group they've had, for example, a sexist man is always going to think I'm stupid no matter how much I show I'm not stupid. Even if I am impressive, I'll be seen as an \"exception\" to other women.

For example, a Mom living in the woods on Tiktok may appeal to your anxiety as a Mother by telling you a vaccines are bad and there are much better ways to help your child. However, an actual Doctor who slaved away in medical school is not going to tell you the same thing, and isn't going to appeal to your not-always-rational anxiety. \n\n\\----Universities: A general disillusionment with society makes people distrust higher-education, which is alarming, because it's literally just more information designed to make them question their world views. It's more comforting to accept that others are plotting against you than to accept your world views on a lot of important topics are limited or wrong. \n\n\\----Cities: Deeply disturbing how there is an inherent distrust of cities... places of major intellectual and economic importance.

Modern media sucks (that’s what the mainstream reviewers won’t tell you) but progressive politics is not what’s ruining things (that’s what the social media influencer reviewers won’t tell you). All the progressive things that can be done to make a story more diverse and give demographics more representation can be done well and in some cases like the Owl House or Hazbin Hotel, they have been done well. Take the live action little mermaid remake. Everyone was talking about how race-swapping Ariel ruined it, but did it? Me personally I don’t care about who played Ariel I want to know if the story itself was well written, were the characters likable? And the answer to both of these questions is of course not. It was a soulless corporate cash grab like every other Disney live action remake. And here in lies the REAL problem with modern media. The big Hollywood executives aren’t interested in art they are interested in profit margins and so what they want is to mass produce blockbusters. So they’ve made a formula but it’s lacking something a secret ingredient. They’ve wokeness is just something they’re trying to see if it’s the secret ingredient and when they finally figure out it’s not they’ll go looking for a new ingredient. They’ll probably try AI next and those movies will suck even harder. But here’s the thing the ingredient they are looking for doesn’t exist. You can’t mass produce great movies. You need to put in the effort to make movies great it’s a craft not something that can be mass produced and retain value. The video game TV and  comic book industry’s are doing the same thing trying to complete a formula by finding a secret ingredient that doesn’t exist. "}

While I am grateful for many things that the internet has provided, life was better pre-social media in so many ways.  Just in the past few minutes of random browsing here on reddit, I came across 2 posts that cut to the core of my thoughts and feelings in it.  One was \"name one annoying thing that people base their entire identity around\" and another was \"here is a specific thing that some people base their entire identity around, and why I hate it\".  This whole thing with identity and ego.  Social media amplifies this problem where you only feel good about yourself when others \"like\" you, but then there is the question of who even ARE you... which most people answer by stating things that they \"like\" e.g., crossfit, gender identity, being a childless woman, being a trad wife.  It's all so asinine.  This is not how we should be defining ourselves.  Or rather, I'd argue that we should in fact STOP being so obsessed with defining ourselves, and get to work defining how we want to treat each other, and what kind of a world we want to live in.  \n\nWhen you spend time with other humans offline, as we all used to, there is no longer this pressing need to define yourself by what you \"like\", no longer this pressing need to define your personality \"type\" in relation to others.  In-person interactions (and phone calls kids! phone calls!) leave room for nuance, grey areas, perspective shifting, and the ability to be so much more than a one-dimensional representation with entertaining \"soundbites\".  \n\nAll that said, my particular \"social media identity peeve\" is the people making the self-help posts about being your \"authentic self\".  LOL.  It reminds me of when \"alternative\" music became mainstream.  They are making \"anti-social media\" the identity that they are using to generate their likes on social media.  And then here I am, on social media, hate-posting about the people who define themselves in opposition to the very things that I hate about social media simply because they are using social media to generate likes.

Guard dogs can prevent intruders from entering your home.

They can also carry dangerous bacteria such as Salmonella and parasites like Giardia and Cryptosporidium. Hence, they should be kept in your backyard, not inside your home.\n\nFor reasons other than convenience, I believe they're no more than a nuisance. A household is not a home for animals, as the captivity limits their natural behavior and places both their mental and physical well-being at risk.\n\nThink about it. Why do people need to walk their dogs? Because they need physical exercise, it's important for their mental health and walks are a major source of sensory input for a dog. All of these problems would've been solved had we not domesticated dogs in the first place. Animals are wild creatures with needs that drastically differ from humans. We cannot emprison them inside a 2 story building (let alone a one story building) for 8 hours until we come back from work.\n\nThis also applies to fish, birds, cats, and a many more. Except that the latter don't get the benefit of occasional walks and thus will never get a taste of the life mother nature intended for them.\n\nAnd as for the argument of companionship and emotional support provided by animals, I personally believe that relationships should be with humans, not animals (and yes I don't believe humans are animals nor that we evolved from monkeys).\n\n\nThis is just my opinion obviously, I was just curious to see if anybody else had a similar viewpoint 😁"}

The app trains us to crave quick dopamine hits, shortening attention spans and replacing depth with fleeting, algorithm-driven trends. It’s like eating junk food for your brain: fun in the moment, but ultimately unfulfilling and harmful in the long run.\n\nWhile TikTok has sparked creativity, it’s also fueled toxic cycles of comparison, misinformation, and endless fo it for the Vine mentality that leave us mentally drained and more divided. Maybe a ban isn’t such a bad thing—it might force us to detox and reclaim our ability to focus on things that truly matter. Sometimes, the healthiest choice is stepping away, even if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOn the free speech angle:\nThe First Amendment guarantees that “Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech.” This provision is directed at government actions that suppress speech based on its content or viewpoint. However, the focus of a TikTok ban rest on national security and data privacy concerns, rather than the regulation of specific speech or ideas.\n\nIf the government can demonstrate that such a ban is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest—such as protecting sensitive user data from foreign surveillance—it may survive constitutional scrutiny under legal doctrines like the \"strict scrutiny test.\" Importantly, the ban would target the platform itself as a mechanism of data collection, not the content being shared on it. A ban on TikTok would not inherently prevent individuals from expressing themselves; it would merely restrict the use of a specific medium which qualify as a foreign government interaction via social media. The courts have long held that the government has the authority to regulate certain platforms or channels under specific conditions, provided alternative avenues for speech remain available. For instance, users could still express their ideas on other social media platforms, blogs, or public forums, thus preserving their ability to communicate and not trampling rights.\n"}

It has also been one of the most rewarding experiences because it has taught me how to work through those differences myself and also how to set healthy boundaries, two things that I have always struggled with in other past relationships that I wish I had worked harder at keeping.\n\nIn today's world we are so caught up with instant gratification and serving our own expectations in life that we tend to cut off or go no contact with everyone who's opinions or experiences vary from ours. In the time I have given myself to work through mine and my parents differences I have learned a lot of skills related to relationship building that I wish I had learned at a much younger age.\n\n So despite what media and influencers say online, if you're struggling while living with family and its possible to work through your differences, do it, or at least give it a shot. You will learn a lot about yourself and where your personal boundaries are and how you can maintain relationships, even when they get rocky."}

There are many instances of people (men and women) losing weight and talking about how they started being treated better, even outside of an intimate setting. Humans put a lot of focus on looks and I'm just tired of the \"Looks aren't that important\" because they are. Even when I lose all the weight I need to, I'll still be unattractive due to skin conditions and general features. Most of the people who swear they're ugly and have found love aren't ugly at all.

{"Article Number": 243, "title": "Infant Circumcision is Unnecessary and Harmful", "article": "A key component of ethical healthcare is the patient’s informed consent. Because a child is not legally competent to consent to a surgery, it is the parent’s responsibility to give or withhold consent by proxy. However, this responsibility does not mean that the parent has *carte blanche* to consent to anything they like. Forcing a permanent body modification on the body of another person is not a valid moral decision if the modification is not medically necessary. And yet, the most common body modification done in the United States–infant circumcision–comes nowhere near being necessary. Many of the reasons given in defense of infant circumcision are flawed. For example:\n\n*Circumcision lowers the risk of urinary tract infection in infants.* In fact, circumcised babies are [just as likely](https://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/mueller/) to contract UTI as intact babies.\n\n*It eliminates the risk of penile cancer.* Circumcised men can still get penile cancer. [One study](https://cdn.mdedge.com/files/s3fs-public/jfp-archived-issues/1997-volume_44-45/JFP_1997-04_v44_i4_carcinoma-in-situ-of-the-penis-in-a-76-y.pdf) in 1997 noted that Denmark, in which 1.6% of men were circumcised, had a lower rate of penile cancer than the USA, in which 60% to 80% of men were circumcised. \n\n*It lowers the risk of HIV.* If this were true, one would expect non-circumcising Denmark to have a higher HIV rate than the USA; instead, the opposite is the case. In 2022, there were 11.3 new HIV infections per 100,000 people in the [USA](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20there%20were%2031%2C800%20estimated%20new%20HIV,and%2087%25%20of%20estimated%20infections%20among%20all%20males.) compared to 1.9 per 100,000 in [Denmark](https://en.ssi.dk/surveillance-and-preparedness/surveillance-in-denmark/annual-reports-on-disease-incidence/hiv-2022). The HIV-prevention myth originates from three studies that were done in Africa and were riddled with [methodological problems](https://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Birx-letter-WHO-HIV-PEPFAR-circumcision-06-29-20.pdf). The conclusions of the African studies have also been disproved by a recent Canadian study of over half a million males in Ontario, which found that there is [no correlation](https://www.auajournals.org/doi/10.1097/JU.0000000000002234) between circumcision status and risk of HIV.\n\n*It can sometimes be necessary to treat phimosis.* A tight foreskin, also known as phimosis, is normal and natural in newborns, because the foreskin is fused to the glans. The foreskin usually loosens and retracts on its own by adolescence. If not, phimosis is easily treatable with plastic phimosis rings, which gently stretch the skin over the course of a few months.\n\n*A circumcised penis is cleaner than an intact penis.* Like any other body part, a foreskin will be clean if it is washed. The hygiene claim has no relevance for people who take showers.\n\n*A circumcised penis is aesthetic.* Since aesthetic appearance is a matter of personal preference, not of medical necessity, it ought to be left to the owner of the penis, when he is old enough to decide for himself.\n\n*A circumcised penis is still functional.* This is true in the sense that a circumcised penis can achieve erection and ejaculation, but there is more to sex than being able to reproduce. The penis is a sensory organ; losing part of it will entail a loss of sensory function.\n\nInfant circumcision is bad for the baby, and for the man he will become. Its harms include the following:\n\n–The infant’s suffering both during and after the surgery, which is [traumatizing](https://www.cirp.org/library/psych/goldman1/).\n\n–Loss of erogenous [nerve endings](https://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/for-professionals/sexual-impact/).\n\n–Loss of the natural gliding motion of the foreskin over the glans during sex, causing friction and vaginal dryness.\n\n–Loss of the protective cover which keeps the glans moist, soft, and sensitive. In a circumcised penis, the glans becomes dried out and keratinized, and loses most of its [erogenous sensitivity](https://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06685.x).\n\nThe medical profession has been aware of the sexual functions of the foreskin for a long time. In fact, infant circumcision is a fossil of nineteenth-century anti-masturbation pseudo-science. In the 1870s, certain American doctors began to speculate that masturbation was the underlying cause of all sorts of maladies—syphilis, paralysis, tuberculosis, and epilepsy, to name a few. Because the foreskin is densely packed with erogenous nerve endings, these doctors knew that its excision would reduce sexual sensitivity. In 1901, Dr. E.G. Mark [wrote](http://www.noharmm.org/docswords.htm) in American Practitioner and News:\n\n\"Pleasurable sensations are elicited from the extremely sensitive mucous membrane [of the foreskin], with resultant manipulation and masturbation. The exposure of the glans penis following circumcision … lessens the sensitiveness of the organ. It therefore lies with the physicians, the family adviser in affairs hygienic and medical, to urge its acceptance.\"\n\nPut differently, it was their intention to diminish sexual sensation. That is why infant circumcision became standard practice in the United States. Modern claims that it has no impact on male sexual health are either ill-informed or disingenuous.\n\nIn other developed countries, doctors advise against infant circumcision. For example, the Royal Dutch Medical Association [states](https://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/knmg-non-therapeutic-circumcision-of-male-minors-27-05-2010.pdf) that “there is no convincing evidence that circumcision is useful or necessary in terms of prevention or hygiene.” By contrast, the United States has a for-profit medical industry, which recommends infant circumcision because it is profitable. Hospitals make money from circumcisions, then sell the foreskins to companies that harvest the keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which are used to make skin substitutes such as [Apligraf](https://apligraf.com/pdf/Apligraf-FactSheet.pdf). As long as there is a profit incentive for the American medical industry to harvest babies’ foreskins, it will continue to push the procedure on parents who don’t know any better.\n\nWhy is this a taboo topic? Circumcised men do not want to admit that their penises are missing something, because it feels emasculating. Parents do not want to admit that they allowed their sons to be harmed. Doctors do not want to admit that they have harmed baby boys. There is a general unwillingness to face uncomfortable facts.\n\nInfant circumcision is a needless surgery on a perfectly healthy baby, designed to destroy a functional, healthy part of his penis. Attempts to justify it rest upon the conceit that half of the human race requires immediate surgical alteration at birth. Because it is unnecessary and harmful, it is also indefensible."}

And it's not like you're constantly doing 10 outfit changes on the floor.\n\nThere's this crazy invention called: LOCKERS\n\nHere’s the thing: You **never** see a scrawny skinny beginner guy doing this. But the second someone bulks up and fits the “gym bro” category, suddenly, they’re carrying a bag around. It’s all about the aesthetic, not practicality.\n\nI hit the gym frequently and I'm not skinny nor a beginner. I'm also very friendly with many regulars. One time, I asked a someone why he carried a bag everywhere, and he said most of it was just extra clothes or shoes he didn’t even use. And he doesn't trust the lockers with his valuables. I was like... wait a sec. what changed because clearly you used to have a small bag and changed in the lockers just like everyone else and now .... you're too good for that because you look like Hulk?\n\nWhy not leave it in the car? Most people drive to the gym anyway.\n\nThe reality is, this whole oversized gym bag thing screams “LOOK AT ME” My theory got confirmed when a friend dropped me off at the gym one time and said, “You look like you’re going to the library.” I was wearing a knitted sweater, glasses, and carrying a tote bag with my essentials: gym clothes, earbuds, wallet, keys, and pre-workout which I still do. And I told him that I really don't give af what people think of me. A totebag or any other bag is fine as long as it can carry my stuff.\n\nAt the end of the day, lets be real, carrying a large duffle gym bag around in the gym is nothing more than a prop to these people and they want to fit into this certain image. but they would never admit."}

The idea of sharing my life story with a stranger and reliving painful experiences that I’m actively trying to move past feels counterproductive. Instead of moving forward, I find myself dwelling on the past, reopening wounds that were already starting to heal.\n\nI think many men deal with problems differently. We’re often solution-oriented. When we face a challenge, we want practical advice, tangible steps, and ways to take action. Therapy, on the other hand, often focuses on introspection and emotional exploration."}

{"Article Number": 252, "title": "Plenty of prostitutes are in the business because they like it. ", "article": "When you mention prostitution here on Reddit, you will instantly be bombarded by a crowd of angry people who claim that all women in prostitution are being exploited and either do it because they are forced to or because they have no way out. And that to a woman being paid for sex by a man just feels like being violated. \n\nI've in the past visited my fair share of prostitutes and erotic massage places. And frankly I have never had this experience. I remember the first time I visited a prostitute. It was a middle aged woman, living in a large house in a posh village with expensive cars in their driveway. Her husband had his own business, her kids were in college. She simply enjoyed the thrill of being a typical suburban housewife by day, while secretly being a prostitute by night. \n\nAnd those types I've seen more often. It should be said they are not the 21 year old Asian women with the tight body, but usually 40+ housewives and often a bit overweight. Their motives can be; \n\n\\- Just having a very liberal mentality towards sex with strangers and seeing it as an easy way to make a living (or an extra income). \n\n\\- Being into specific fetishes. Especially in the BDSM scene or when their partner is a cuck who liked to watch (or sometimes the husband might join). \n\n\\- Sometimes, simply being paid for sex is the fetish. \n\nAnother example would be an erotic masseuse I really liked to visit because she is very good at her job. She told me that when she came to the Netherlands, she first worked in a warehouse for 9 hours a day doing harsh physical labor and was very depressed. She finds live as an erotic massage therapist much more relaxed plus one client for 1 hour a day is enough for her to get by so she has a lot of free time. \n\nA final example was a 26 year old college student, to who being paid for sex seemed to be a bucketlist thing she wanted to try. She was very exited and actually responded genuinely disappointed when I declined a blowjob for instance. \n\nSure, I admit that I'm cherry picking here, and these are not the majority of all prostitutes. But they do exist. And when you know how to look for them, I guarantee you they offer you a much more high quality experience, with the added benefit that in the end you know both of you enjoyed it and you didn't take advantage of anyone.

{"Article Number": 253, "title": "Accepting Unattractiveness Is Like Death for a Woman", "article": "\nAdmitting you’re unattractive feels as taboo as discussing death because it forces people to confront uncomfortable truths they’d rather avoid. Society clings to platitudes like “Everyone is beautiful,” just as people use clichés to comfort the grieving, leaving no space for honest discussion.\n\nIt’s awkward because no one knows how to respond—agreeing feels cruel, but denying it feels fake. Saying you’re unattractive also exposes a vulnerability most people hide, making others confront their own insecurities about beauty. Ultimately, it feels like a social death, a loss of status and power, which society prefers to ignore rather than address.\n\n\n\nThe Stages of Grief in Accepting Unattractiveness:\n\n1. Denial\n\nAt first, you might convince yourself that beauty doesn’t matter. You tell yourself, \"It’s what’s inside that counts,\" even as the world screams otherwise. You cling to the hope that your personality, intelligence, or kindness will somehow override societal standards. Some women even fall into the \"i can't be ugly. it's because of sexism, racism, beauty standards, white people, bullies, colorist ect.\" \"It's not me, it's them\".\n\n2. Anger\n\nThis is where you confront the brutal truth: people are shallow, and the world revolves around appearances. The anger stems from cognitive dissonance—the clash between the belief that \"it’s what’s inside that counts\" and the reality that society values beauty above all else.\n\nYou’re enraged by the betrayal of ideals you grew up believing, like kindness or intelligence mattering more than looks. Watching beautiful people receive opportunities, admiration, and love while you’re overlooked feels like a slap in the face.\n\n3. Bargaining\n\nthis stage is about bargaining with reality: If I work hard enough, people will finally see me as beautiful. You think with enough effort, you can escape the prison of unattractiveness. You convince yourself that self-improvement is the key to acceptance, admiration, and love. \"Maybe it's not my looks. I just need a new hairstyle or get contact lenses\" Maybe you dive into makeup tutorials, lose weight, or overhaul your wardrobe, thinking that if you just try hard enough, you can \"fix\" yourself. You pray for a glow-up as though it’s a divine intervention, a miracle that will transform your life overnight. The pain of this stage comes from realizing that no amount of effort can guarantee the validation you’re seeking.\n\n4. Depression\n\nIn this stage, the hopelessness becomes overwhelming as you realize no amount of effort can change how society perceives you. You feel invisible, overlooked in both social and professional spaces, and lonely, disconnected from a world that seems to value beauty above all else.\n\nShame sets in, as society’s standards make you believe your appearance is a personal failing. Comparisons with others—especially on social media—fuel bitterness and self-loathing. You withdraw, avoiding situations where you feel judged or ignored, and question your worth, wondering if life will always feel this empty.\n\n5. Acceptance: The Hardest Thing a Woman Can Do In Her Life\n\nAcceptance is the most challenging stage because it requires rejecting the lifelong conditioning that ties a woman’s worth to her beauty. It means letting go of societal validation, knowing you may never receive the attention or admiration beauty affords, and instead defining your value on your own terms.\n\nYou stop chasing the beauty rat race—no more endless diets, makeup routines, or comparisons—and focus on what truly fulfills you, like your skills, relationships, and personal growth. It’s not easy; the world constantly reminds you of its obsession with appearance, and acceptance can feel isolating.\n\nBut it’s also freeing. Acceptance allows you to reclaim your identity, live authentically, and detach your worth from a shallow system. Though the pain of unfairness lingers, stepping off the hamster wheel of validation is a radical act of self-liberation."}

Women have it a LOT easier in the dating world.\n\nThe reason is simple. Women have many, MANY more options. People who try to make the counter argument have various ways of trying to weasel out of this basic fact.\n\nFirst off, they try to paint having that many options as a disadvantage. They try to say that now they have to sift and find the good ones. I'm not saying sifting is always easy but it's much easier than having limited options.\n\nSecondly, a lot of people say it's harder because women run the risk of pregnancy. This seems valid but crumbles very quickly. First off, every form of invisible contraception is tailored for women. Every. single. one.\n\nSo, if a woman doesn't want to be pregnant, she can just use birth control. It really isn't that difficult. Or if that fails, she can get on a flight to the West Coast or Northeast and essentially pay for not being pregnant. No, I don't think women should have to travel like this at all, but they have this option. Men can't unilaterally book a trip to Seattle, Baltimore, or Chicago to escape a pregnancy. So, if anything, pregnancy potential is more of a disadvantage to the man who can't control what happens after.\n\nIt's very clear that women have the advantage. If a man wants to date, he has to hit the gym massively and get his money way up. Not bad things for sure, but a very high bar.\n\nOh, and also, he better hope he has good looks because if he's under 5'6 or has other bad looks he's SOL even if he does the above. Ask me how I know about the height disadvantage. I've LIVED it.\n\nWomen on the other hand don't need to do anything. If she exists, she will have options approach her. Also, she can literally just wear short shorts or a really short skirt and the amount of men approaching her will skyrocket. All she has to do is pick one of them."}

I love cats but I belief domesticated  pet cats they should be mostly indoor just like dogs, however at least they are somewhat domesticated even though they still are likely causing harm to wildlife when let outside... I think feral cats should have been included in the predator free 2025 goal. The biggest issue is actually wild, grouchy, wild feral cats that breed relentlessly. No one owns these cats, they rely basically solely on the wildlife population for sustenance and there are many of them roaming free in New Zealand.   \n  \nNZ is trying to rejuvenate the population count of wildlife that evolved without cats. They are a apex predator and flightless birds are particularly susceptible as they cannot fly away or defend themselves. NZ should have a program to reduce wild cats populations and encourage domestic cats to be mostly kept indoors. Unlike other countries, there is no other predator to minimise or balance feral cats population, otherwise this may not be as big of an issue. Their population is getting out of control and unfortunately neutering wouldn't work super well as they may not be able to breed but they can still hurt bird populations. It is hard to minimise a population of something like this as they remind us so much of our fur babies and loved pets.  I have owned and looked after many pets in my life, including domestic cats that live mostly outside (which I may or may not have owned). My opinion comes after considering the topic for over 10 years and the delicate nature of NZ's wildlife. Domesticated dogs would never be allowed to roam free in modern day without risking it getting taken to the vets, SPCA or getting potentially put down by a local farmer trying to protect their stock (potentially). Again, I love cats and enjoy their company but I am also all for growing NZ's native wildlife populations, being as at risk as they already are thus far. There already is a similar program and incentive for wild possums, unlike in Australia where they are protected.\n\nPerhaps wildlife conservationists should start with managing populations of feral cats in NZ's public reserves first, where native birds are most likely to prosper and islands :) Then work their way into more populated areas? No one ever said it was fun, but something simply must be done about it or local wildlife will suffer and likely already do."}

They maintain their own sphere of influence mostly formed of former French colonies and intervene there when they deem necessary.They will defy the US and everyone else when they don't agree. Most notably the US invasion of Iraq, pulling out of the Breton Woods system and even pulling out of NATOs command structure at one point. \n\nWhile doing all of this they work with everyone around them because they know nothing goods gonna come out of bullying your neighbors and plenty of benefits can come out of working together. They found organizations like NATO and the EU because they knew it would get them more powerful not less.\n\nIf Russia worked with the West instead of threatening them when they do stuff like install missile defense systems or invading countries that don't bend to their will they would have had massive benefits from trade and would have been way more powerful diplomatically. They could have kept their sphere of influence, their own independent foreign policy and all that jazz. Even doing the odd intervention here and there without much condemnation. They could have keep a lot of soft power presenting themselves as the land of hard bass, Masha and the Bear and Tetris. Even in Ukraine before they started bullying them in 2013, Ukraine had something like 70% of the TV programs in Russian. They lost all of that because of being overly aggressive.\n\n"}

", "article": "I love JP and I conclude that after listening to him on his podcast or youtube I do often have to stop, rewind, and listen to what he said again to understand what he means. He does use a lot of big words. But if you claim that he just makes nonsense statements and compare him to Deepak Chopra, you probably have a gap in your understanding of different belief systems. \n\nPeterson’s framework for understanding the world is rooted in a combination of evolutionary psychology, archetypal narratives, and a Christian moral outlook. People who approach these topics from a different framework—such as postmodernism, social constructivism, or purely empirical science—may find his arguments alien or difficult to grasp. Although he does dodge the question of God, he basically starts from the perspective that God exists, or at least that objective morality exists. I think a lot of the confusion about his statements starts from there. I was raised Christian (still am, but was raised that way too), but I think if you're not really familiar with the Christian worldview, or at least an Abrahamic one, which isn't materialist, that's a stumbling block for many to understanding what he's talking about. \n\nHis ideas often also leave room for interpretation, which can lead to misunderstandings. For example, his discussions on hierarchies, order vs. chaos, and the importance of traditional structures can be interpreted in vastly different ways, depending on your perspective. What I've found with people who find him hard to understand or hate him is that he takes the perspective that hierarchies are necessary, in the sense that they will always exist because they are a part of nature, as an attempted justification of the hierarchies exactly as they are now. Peterson's definitely a conservative, but most of his work is about how we can't get rid of hierarchies in general, not that hierarchies should never be altered. \n\nIt's also true that when he talks, even about a simple question, he often starts talking about things in multiple disciplines, linking psychology to sociology, biology, and literature too (guy loves Russian literature and the Bible). This makes his arguments complex, layered arguments that require listeners to follow long trains of thought. This can be difficult if you want a simple answer, which is frustrating for even me (like you talk about God all the time Jordan, how can you possibly tell people you don't know what they mean when they ask you if you believe in Him?), but it doesn't mean he's full of shit. It makes him a university professor (try reading Lacan if you want a hard read). He deals with questions at a very deep level. \n\nBasically, you can call him totally wrong and evil if you want, I don't care that much. He's not me. But it's not like he makes no sense. I think people who think he makes no sense just want a really quick, snarky answer, and that's not always the right way to be.

Canadians have this inferiority complex that is despicable to me. Actively finding flaws in their southern neighbors, but turning a blind eye to their own. All rooted in resentment and jealousy because not only does the USA have a larger economy, but is successful in growing it and producing successful contributions to the world. Like the arts industry, tech, aviation, finances...even successful Canadian actors and singers wind up living in California. The Canadian economy has been stagnating at around 2 trillion. 4 years ago, the US economy was at 21 trillion. Now, it's 27 and growing fast. Plus, salaries are higher in some industries and cost of living is lower in most parts of the US excluding the top famous cities. In addition, Canadians who would like to avoid the cold such as the snowbirds, they now would have unlimited time to stay in Florida without restrictions set by immigration law.\n\nThe only downsides are healthcare and safety. But healthcare is context-dependent and a lot of Canadians assume Americans pay out of pocket which is pretty ignorant, but they'll eventually figure it out. Most people have insurance for themselves so we should learn the concept of self reliance instead of demanding freebies. Healthcare should be free only for those who can't take care of themselves due to extraordinary circumstances such being mentally disabled. But for the majority, they just have to treat it like dental insurance. It's not a significant impact really plus you get perks of privatized healthcare including short wait times and access to experimental futuristic treatments if you really want to pay for it. The current system of banning health insurance is ridiculous. Healthcare in the US functionally has the right idea. It's just the costs, but that can be solved. Finally for guns, that's controversial because a proportion of Canadians were not happy with Trudeau's actions of banning guns from law-abiding citizens in response to criminals who obtained their guns illegally. As for shootings and crime, they're mostly done by poor people. It's highly unlikely they have the finances to move up north and stir trouble if the border is removed. For mass shootings, besides Detroit and Buffalo, the other American cities that are considered dangerous are pretty far away.

The CCP uses visual techniques to make Chinese infrastructure projects like Chinese bridges, highways or tunnels look emotionally appeasing to the gullible and dissaloussioned.

If filming people without consent is the issue, they can always blur faces, and most people in the background don’t stand out anyway. The issue is completely gone if you record in your own home, ***yet some cities still require permits for private property.***\n\nThe law is vague enough that monetizing your channel, or even just uploading at all, makes you required to let the city council know two weeks in advance (which isn’t good for spontaneity), potentially get the county involved too, cough up the money, and recognize that they think it’s fair to stea-confiscate your camera and cen-destroy your footage if you don’t follow.

{"Article Number": 318, "title": "The Truth Behind the Manipulation: A Call to Wake Up and Stand Together", "article": "We are living in a time where the truth is increasingly difficult to find, not because it’s hidden, but because the very institutions meant to inform us are the ones manipulating the narratives we’re fed. It’s time we wake up to the reality of what’s happening around us, not just in our country, but globally. The media and our government have been controlling the story for far too long, and we’ve let it happen by failing to question, by failing to critically analyze what we’re told.\n\nThe History of Propaganda and Manipulation\n\nThe manipulation we’re witnessing today isn’t new. In fact, it’s been happening for centuries. Take, for example, the story we were all taught about Christopher Columbus. We were told that he “discovered” America, that he was a brave explorer seeking new lands. But the truth is much darker. Columbus’s arrival marked the beginning of the genocide of indigenous people and the pillaging of their land. The narrative that we were fed in school was crafted to justify the horrors of colonization and to sanitize the violence and exploitation that followed. It’s a narrative that erases the real history and hides the atrocities committed in the name of expansion. The idea that we “discovered” land that was already inhabited is a complete distortion of reality and one of the oldest propaganda tactics used to maintain power and control.\n\nAnd this type of manipulation didn’t stop there. In the U.S., during World War II, the government created the Office of Wartime Information, which produced propaganda to shape how we saw the Japanese and other nations. This is the same tactic we’ve seen throughout history: an external enemy is created and exaggerated to maintain control. And this doesn’t end there. When we look at the Holocaust, it’s essential to acknowledge that there’s only one true German viewpoint documentary on the war. The rest are heavily shaped by the perspectives of the Allied forces, mainly the U.S. This isn’t to diminish the tragedy of the Holocaust, but rather to remind us that history itself can be bent to fit a narrative—and not always the one we’ve been taught.\n\nThe New Orleans Situation: Manipulation at Its Finest\n\nOne of the most recent and deeply troubling examples of media manipulation came with the tragic attack in New Orleans on New Year’s Day. A man, allegedly connected to ISIS, drove a truck into a crowd of people, killing 14. Following the attack, the FBI raided his home. The next day, New York Post reporter, Jennie Taer , was allowed to walk freely through the crime scene, which was disturbingly pristine, showing an organized bookshelf, an open Quran, a prayer rug, and a pair of shoes placed in front of them.\n\nThis alone raised numerous red flags. It didn’t take long for people to see through this blatant manipulation. The man’s home appeared meticulously staged, almost as though someone wanted to paint a picture of the attack that fit a specific narrative—one that would once again fuel anti-Muslim sentiment. In every comment section I’ve read, not one person believes this attack wasn’t staged or manipulated in some way. This is a clear example of how our government and media can engineer public perception, and it’s time we start questioning the motives behind it.\n\nMainstream Media Today: The Scripted Reality\n\nFast forward to today, and it’s clearer than ever that the media operates on a script. Have you ever noticed that no matter which news outlet you turn to, the stories are almost identical? The same talking points, the same wording, often in sync across major news stations. This is no accident. It’s the result of a controlled narrative that’s carefully curated and distributed by those in power. The media isn’t here to inform us; they’re here to shape our views, divide us, and ultimately keep us in a state of fear and confusion. This is how they keep us from seeing the bigger picture, how they distract us from the reality of our collective power.\n\nThe Role of TikTok and Censorship\n\nOne of the most glaring examples of this manipulation today is the growing push to ban TikTok in the U.S. Since its rise, TikTok has become a platform for the free exchange of ideas, knowledge, and perspectives—things the mainstream media can’t control. It’s allowed us to see behind the curtains of government and corporate control, to hear from people outside of the narrative they’ve built. And that’s why the powers that be are threatened. They don’t want us to connect with each other, to share information that challenges their narrative. They want us in the dark, dependent on their controlled media outlets to tell us what’s real.\n\nTikTok may have its fair share of misinformation, but that’s a problem we can address with critical thinking and discernment. The solution isn’t to censor it, but to encourage education and media literacy. Banning TikTok is about silencing the voices that don’t fit the narrative—voices that are challenging the status quo.\n\nPalestine and Israel: A Reflection on Our Own History\n\nThe ongoing conflict between Palestine and Israel has its own roots in territorial disputes, much like the colonial mindset that has plagued the world for centuries. But here’s the part that makes me question the role of the U.S. in supporting either side: Imagine if the roles were reversed. Imagine if, as Americans, we decided to go back to Europe and reclaim the land our ancestors once occupied simply because we feel entitled to it. We wouldn’t be well-received, and rightfully so. Just because our ancestors came from there doesn’t mean we have any rightful claim to that land now, and we’d likely be met with resistance if we tried to impose ourselves on that land.\n\nSo why are we getting involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Shouldn’t we be striving for peace and unity, not taking sides in a conflict that has nothing to do with us? We, as a nation, should be the ones leading efforts for peaceful resolution between all nations—not taking sides in conflicts that are far older and more complex than we could ever understand. Our interference in such matters only fuels further division and hatred. We should be working toward solutions that benefit humanity as a whole, not pushing one group over another. Our involvement should be focused on creating bridges, not building walls.\n\nCall to Action: Unity, Love, and Peace\n\nWe are at a crossroads. We have been manipulated, divided, and led to believe that we are powerless in the face of the powers that control us. But the truth is, if we came together—if we united in love, understanding, and peace—we would be an unstoppable force. It’s not about overthrowing anyone, but about reclaiming our collective power and creating a society where everyone, not just the elite few, has the chance to thrive.\n\nSo, I ask you: let’s wake up.

That they owe it to society. But, I think that billionaires should give less to charity and spend more of it on high-impact businesses.\n\nWhat do I mean by this? Great examples are Tesla and SpaceX. Tesla, as a private corporation, has captured a large share of the global EV market. SpaceX, as a private corporation, is way ahead of any private or government entity in terms of launch price and capability. And these amazing things were accomplished without charitable donations, and they also supply thousands of jobs (OK, OK, I know you are about to open your mouths to argue about this, but just consider that charity by itself probably would not have been able to accomplish this).\n\nAnother example I like to use is diabetes. When you think of trying to cure diabetes, it is usually in the case of detection (blood sugar), mitigations, or some kind of drug that moderates blood sugar. Add to that numerous research labs (some academic, some corporate) that are all busy attacking various problems. But so much of this is just nibbling around the edges! I feel like nobody has really tried to attack the problem directly, such as with tissue regeneration. They've done it in mice. Why not just spend 50 billion dollars on some method that could directly cure the disease? I guarantee you that the first billionaire to create a company for this problem and solve it would become the first trillioniare. And probably get a horse's head in his bed. Again, you can argue with this point, but I think you get the idea.\n\nIn summary, I think the profit motive is a great way for billionaires to spend money, since they have the money to achieve escape velocity in a lot of areas, can pursue many avenues that governments are not interested in, and can employ many people. It's just a much better proposition, and there are numerous ideas one could use."}

I’d say this is perfectly reasonable grounds to remove posts and even ban the user if the behavior continues. \n\nSecond example let’s say you have a political organization that builds a website for like minded individuals to come together and discuss their ideas. But users from different ideologies come in to pick fights. Once again I think it’s perfectly reasonable to ban people here. The purpose of the website isn’t to be a free market of ideas, it’s meant to be a place for people of a specific ideology to discuss ideas with each other. \n\nFinal example let’s say you build a website for people to make connections, discuss their interests, and share interesting things with each other. Like a social media site. However, you want it to be a welcoming place for the vast majority of people so you decide that certain ideas that might make certain groups feel unwelcome aren’t allowed. You realize that this will make people who want to express those ideas feel unwelcome, but this is your platform and they are free to go somewhere else. \n\nBasically what I’m trying to say is if y’all want to say whatever you want on Twitter that’s fine, but there are a lot of people who don’t want to hear it, and they shouldn’t be forced to hear it either. There’s nothing wrong with a platform like Bluesky or Reddit to have more restrictive rules for people who’d rather not hear whatever it is you have to say.

Persecution of Jews in Germany was legal. Marital rape was legal in most places until the late 20th Century and still is in some places). Secondly, many of the situations that result in the retort \"their house their rules\" are describing illegal situations, such as abuse via social or emotional neglect, or coercive control (in British legislation since 2015). Thirdly, even in cases where it's not clearly against the law based on the limited information given, people who use this phrase don't make any effort to first ascertain if the situation is part of a wider pattern which is against the law. All of this indicates they aren't really bothered about the legality of the situation and are only bothered about compliance with the dictum of \"my house my rules\".\n\nBased on your own words (don't deny it, take responsibility for what comes from your own mouth), you also believe that children do not have a right to a home until they're in an economic situation to live alone. So in the interest of consistency, you should also never ask children or adults living with their parents/guardians what they do at home - you should now only ask them \"what do you do in your parent's home?\"\n\nYou also do not believe in conflict resolution or attempting to negotiate compromises, if your primary response is \"their house their rules, move out if you don't like it\" to people without basic personal freedoms. Which makes you generally poor at interpersonal relationships.\n\nFurthermore, if your parents were/are so lenient that their version of \"their house their rules\" (the rule you yourself believe as gospel) allowed you to do normal things like seeing friends/family, going outdoors, going shopping, choosing clothes, cooking, having your own phone and ID, using the internet, having ordinary hobbies, making noise on floorboards etc - you should also admit to yourself and to others that you're a privileged and spoilt individual who had a privileged and spoilt beginning to your life.

My longest likely timeline is something on the order of 10 years. My shortest likely timeline is as little as 2 years. In any case, it seems like we are not many conceptual insights away from an AI that can automate remote work at superhuman quality and speed. This would imply that it is close to automating AI research and development itself, which is very likely to kick off a process of self-improving AI systems that rapidly get themselves to levels of intelligence that can only be described as god-like to us. It should be obvious why that is threatening. \n\nI say this because the latest models are getting impressively good scores on tests of mathematics at the highest levels and performing some abstract reasoning tasks at near-human performance (OpenAI's o3 model with the FrontierMath and ARC-AGI tests). It was only one year ago when AI models would get nearly no questions right of the types that appear on these tests. As far as those of us who do not work in a frontier AI lab can tell, it took just one conceptual insight to get AI to this level, something called chain-of-thought, the details of which are outside the scope of this post. This single technique took AI models from being mere statistical token-predictors to doing something that resembles actual reasoning. \n\nThe bleeding-edge models of today are, of course, still limited. They require extraordinary amounts of energy, are not capable of carrying out longer-term tasks, and are inferior to humans at certain kinds of reasoning. But just as one insight took AI from near-zero reasoning ability to non-trivially greater-than-zero reasoning ability, it may not take many additional insights to fix these issues. Heck, we may already have all the insights we need and just need to scale up models. After all, the difference between our brains and those of chimpanzees is not that they fundamentally differ in the kind of processing they do. We just have way more neural synapses. \n\nThe problem with rushing ahead with AI capabilities to the extent that tech companies have been is that we have no idea how to make it value keeping us alive, happy, and free. If it does not value those things, then there is a very good chance of a bad outcome when it gets to superhuman capability. If it does not care about our existence, then what would stop it from killing us in the pursuit of the things that it actually does care about? For example, why would it not boil away the Earth's oceans to power the fusion reactors that provide the energy it uses? Do not get caught up on that specific scenario. It is just meant to illustrate the basic concept. Until this problem is solved, we should not attempt to improve AI capability beyond where they are now.\n\nIt greatly frustrates me that there is no political or social will to address this issue. The government seems perfectly content with letting tech companies continue their reckless AI development. It should instead ban them from continuing this research and work on an international treaty to enforce the ban abroad, but it does not seem interested in pursuing that. If we had any hope at all, much of it was lost with the election of Trump, as he is right in the pockets of the technologists who run these companies. As for the technologists themselves, they have deluded themselves into buying into various specific scenarios for how we can make it through this alive. But these beliefs are a result of rationalizing their preferred conclusion of achieving superhuman AI while avoiding AI catastrophe than any actual forward reasoning from the underlying principles governing intelligent systems. Furthermore, much of the electorate seems blissfully unaware of where AI is headed and therefore could not care less, instead choosing to focus on more transient issues. Oh well, what can you do? I can only try and make people aware of these issues and hope it has some sort of impact. "}

However, I am disgusted at how modern atheism has become a toxic anti-religion echo chamber online by a large minority of radicalised vocal individuals.\n\nWikipedia defines religion as \"*range of social-cultural systems, including designated behaviors and practices, morals, beliefs, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that generally relate humanity to supernatural, transcendental, and spiritual elements—although there is no scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a religion*\".\n\nTherefore, I argue that pure atheism is a standardised, stringent set of systems, behaviours, and practices that purely originate from personal conviction and worldviews. It must not originate from reactionary opposition to religious belief, nor should it be defined by the hostility that some radicalised atheists express toward religious communities. Instead, atheism in its purest form should be understood as a philosophical stance on the lack of an existence of a higher power, reached through individual reflection, not groupthink or tribalism.\n\nAtheism should not become, paradoxically, a quasi-religion of anti-religion. When atheism adopts a rigid orthodoxy of hostility toward belief, it risks becoming the very thing it seeks to oppose: an ideological system rooted in dogma and intolerance. True atheism, I believe, should not concern itself with tearing down religious traditions but instead focus on affirming a worldview based on secular ethics and rational intellectual inquiry.\n\nMany online atheist communities, particularly on certain subreddits, focus excessively on mocking the worst aspects of religion without offering a thoughtful, purist atheist perspective. Instead of exploring secular ethics or existential meaning, they reduce atheism to reactionary ridicule, turning it into a shallow opposition rather than a meaningful worldview. Members of these communities often perpetuate a bleak life-outlook of helplessness, depression, and a void of meaning, when in truth, pure atheism can offer just as much purpose, fulfillment, and moral clarity as religion.\n\nIn short, atheism should be a personal conclusion, not a crusade.\n\nTLDR: Atheism should be a personal conclusion, not an anti-religion crusade. Many online atheist communities focus on mocking religion, promoting a bleak outlook, but pure atheism can offer just as much purpose and meaning as religion when rooted in secular ethics and rational inquiry."}

Men seem to not get the emotional connection they want from a straight relationship, as so many have experienced women not having empathy for them. \n\n2. Men can understand other men’s issues better than women can, due to being able to empathize, rather than just sympathize. They have experienced some of these issues, so it would be easier to understand and relate to their partners issues if their partner was also a man. \n\n3. (DISCLAIMER: THIS IS IN MY EXPERIENCE) Men seem to naturally give solutions/want solutions to a problem rather than just supporting the person or being supported. Whereas women will just support the person/or want support going through a problem. The solution to this is men being with other men, because this would allow them to get the solution to the problem without a woman in the relationship wanting only support, not a solution. They fit like puzzle pieces. \n\n4. Men seem to be happier with other men. I have seen many gay relationships and I have seen many straight relationships. The gay ones seem much happier, and in general I see men being more comfortable around other men; especially if traditional/toxic masculinity is expelled from the zeitgeist. \n\n\nIn conclusion, be gay, do gay things.

Or the other larger institutions holding large amounts of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency? The XRPL isn't owned by Ripple Labs, its a project of a nonprofit foundation. Do you somehow think that a currency that isn't directly associated with a central creator and developer cannot be used for profit in the same way? Do you think people cannot use other \"good\" cryptocurrencies for nefarious purposes? Technologies are not good and evil. \n\nMicrostrategy may turn out to be successful, but it is just as possible for it to crash and burn and hurt a lot of people along with it. The more of the assets larger entities amass, the less different of a world it will be as the entities with assets continue to have assets and to control and manipulate their movement, value, exchange, and perception. So too is it true that so long as we are willing to pay for, sell for, and exchange these coins at the prices set by those holding the largest liquidity, they still maintain control over the currency.   \n  \nMuch like how a magnate of oil might monopolize an oil supply and then set the price, so too can people amass vast quantities of cryptocurrencies and achieve the same. Mayhaps this is what you want but that would seem to betray the core tenet of decentralization of cryptocurrency. With the way that global finance is planning to wrap cryptocurrencies into its own custom ecosystem of multiple ledgers/blockchains, I don't imagine this to be much different than the world we have now."}

You can consent to almost anything with a BAC of 0.08 from a legal standpoint. If you are able to walk around, you can probably consent. Additionally, there is a difference between voluntary and involuntary intoxication. An adult should know that consuming an intoxicant will make them drunk.\n\nI believe that colleges do everyone a disservice by not offering some kind of disclaimer by saying that someone who has consumed alcohol is unable to give consent, because that standard has no teeth outside of the institution's policies and probably causes people to take more risky behaviors than they would otherwise."}

{"Article Number": 423, "title": "Rush Trip are Superior to Slow Trips", "article": "Coming from a middle class perspective, I believe that rush trips are vastly superior to slow trips. I hate how slow travel is labeled as a virtue. The idea of staying in one place for weeks at a time assumes you have the resources to do so. For those on tight budgets or with limited time off, slow travel just isn't worth it.\n\nI travel when I get bored of my day to day life, and I travel to see what I want to see. By the end of my trip, I want to feel exhausted and be able to ponder what the fuck just happened for weeks on end. Travelling is almost always more expensive than not travelling - so taking one's sweet time, sleeping in and \"soaking in the destination\" is extremely inefficient. When you travel, you're paying more to be alive - so you should diversify your expenses. I hate sleeping at the same hotel for 2 nights, because you're paying double for the same experience. I hate eating at the same restaurant twice (while travelling), because no matter how good the food may be, you're paying double for a similar experience. Therefore, spending too much time in the same place is also a waste of money. Plus, most places in the world are just not interesting enough to warrant more than 1-2 days of intensive sightseeing. I have been bored out by some of the world's most lauded big cities, such as Los Angeles and Beijing, but also by some smaller destinations that backpackers spend weeks in - like Lake Atitlan - simply because I spent too much time in them.\n\nPeople say that rush trips are forgettable and that slow trips are more \"meaningful\" and \"memorable.\" On the contrary, I've found that cramming the absolute maximum amount of destinations into my limited vacation days at the lowest price possible actually makes a short amount of time feel longer. I have planned trips under this philosophy for the past 3 years and instantly stopped feeling bored. I'm headed off to Chile, Argentina and Brazil this summer (winter in SA) and have planned 1 day in Santiago, 1 day in Valparaiso, 1 day in Montevideo, 1 day in Colonia del Sacramento, 2 days in Buenos Aires, 1 day in Posadas/San Ignacio, 1 day at the Iguazu Falls, 1 day in Brasilia, 1 day in Salvador de Bahia, 1 day in Fortaleza, 2 days in Rio and 1 day in Sao Paulo. The sheer pace of the trip might look overwhelming but I find so much thrill in flying from city to city and sleeping in overnight buses every other day - at the absolute lowest cost possible, abusing long layovers, multi-city flight ticketing, and dirt cheap buses/trains.\n\nDon't get me wrong - wasting daylight hours on long buses and trains is a colossal waste of efficiency. But when you can dash from place to place while staying the minimum amount of time needed to see what you want to see, all the diverse experiences you have stack up, and you end up with more stories to tell."}

From groceries to electronics everything is cheaper. A flat screen TV was a sign of wealth when I was a kid. Now they are so cheap people put them in their bathrooms. 30 years ago cellphones were a luxury item now they are not only standard but can do ridiculously more.\n\nThat's another thing. Our standard of living has gotten so high what was luxury 20 years ago is economy. Take your average car. Our current economy cars have navigation, power windows, power mirrors, back up cameras, Bluetooth radios, apple carplay and all that. You ever seen what cars where like even before that? My 96 is a manual and doesn't even have a techometer. I was talking to a guy a while back that had a 60's Camero. He had to retro fit everything from seatbelts to the passenger side mirror.\n\nIn terms of reliability cars unless you are dumb enough to buy a Land Rover are heads and shoulders more reliable. Back in the day you drove around with tools in your glove box because they broke down so much you had to fix them regularly on the side of the road. My current car I've driven 40,000 miles and only had to do calipers. That didn't happen with 60's-80s cars or to a lesser extent 90's cars. \n\nEven with stuff that has gotten more expensive. Do realize how much bigger and better houses built in the modern age are? Just take a drive in bumfick no where and look at the size of the houses built in the 50's. A lot of y'all have apartments bigger than some of those houses.\n\n\nYes we have issues that need to be addressed. I even noted healthcare and housing for example. I'm just saying overall it's massively better today and we do not need a revolution. We can fix the problems we have peacefully. Hell the federal government has already been taken steps in the housing direction to make it more affordable.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention income has doubled since the 60's and the middle class is disappearing because so many people are joining the upper middle class.\n\nEdit 2: even with the housing issues we have right now home ownership is higher than most of US history. The peak was 2020 right before the housing crisis at 69% it's now 64%. To put that in perspective it was around 57% in the 50's. Even in that regard you are better off now than most of US history.

This is literally no different than people who become wealthy and now can afford the best things here in the US. \n\nI also notice that these people also don't tend to assimilate to the culture in those countries. They live among other expats, are content creators or \"entrepreneurs\". They aren't working for the same wages as the people there so they don't understand how hard/easy life can be there. \n\nI also notice many of these people never lived anywhere but the city/suburb/small town they were in and will bash America based on things they never saw. Seeing people talk about \"There's fruit with seeds in these countries\" is so crazy, especially if they're in a country the US exports fruits and vegetables to. These people seem to have never heard of a farmer's market or anything. \n\nI think it's great that people get to move and live where they want. We're not all stuck in the same place we were born. But I don't like ignorant statements being put out there for people to think is true. Moving out of your home country (or any country) is a huge step. I think we should be open and honest about how it is. I'd rather someone go \"Hey, I moved to Bali and I love it compared to (home country) but here are the pros and cons\". \n\nNonetheless, the biggest reason these countries are good for them is because they come with USD, salaries that are normal for the US, etc. Of course your life will be better.

A nation where on 9/11 people were recorded chanting “death to America”, and yet the media isn’t even concerned! I personally think supporting Palestine makes you just as big a puppet as supporting Russia; as constantly trying to push foreign interests to the detriment of your own nation is shameful. Also, who’s to say Hamas doesn’t directly fund western politicians into supporting them? Hamas is surprisingly well funded, due to their vast foreign real estate, cryptocurrency and fraudulent charity networks; as well as aid from the likes of Iran and North Korea. Hence in my opinion, any western leader who supports Palestine warrants an immediate investigation into their finances/donors. I personally believe that at least 70% of western politicians whom support Palestine have some sort of indirect funding incentives, curtesy of Hamas and its partners. "}

I own a pitbull. \n\nI can understand on the one hand how everyone wants them gone, but I really think they shouldn’t be banned but instead people should have licenses (or some other type of proof that they have an actual well mannered pitbull. \n\nWhen it comes down to it. It’s mostly backyard breeding or in household breeding. Or people who only get pitbulls just to say they can/have owned one. \n\nNobody really ever takes the time to learn and understand pitbull language.\n\nI really think if more people were aware or if more people understood dogs and pitbulls (the purebreds are the scary ones, their sizes alone intimidate but not every purebred is aggressive either) it is literally down to the owners/people who want the dogs. \n\nThe people who actually get pitbulls for the right reasons should not have to suffer. If pitbulls were to ever get banned in the US as a whole (I live in a state where they’re not banned) I would be devastated. \n\nBecause of a handful of reckless and ignorant people who don’t deserve the breed the right owners are hurt in the end. \n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nSince you wanted to instantly block me after being so disrespectful this is what I have to say to you @ProbablyLongComment \n\nI *am* a victim of assault and rape, I really appreciate you being an ass and assuming things you have no business assuming though, thank you. I was 21 and that was my first experience with a guy that I called a friend. Yay, I absolutely deserved it because I didn’t notice the signs. That’s absolutely not one of the big reasons why I go to therapy.\n\nPitbulls are territorial, they are protective, they are loyal and they are loving, not every pitbull you see or meet will want to bite your hand off.\n\nDon’t give me the “no other breed does this”, I’ve seen Golden Retriever’s aggressive, I’ve seen plenty of smaller dogs aggressive, I’ve seen other big dogs that you wouldn’t even guess they’re aggressive but they are. It’s not the breed, it’s all dogs. All dogs have issues. All dogs are protective and loyal.\n\nI appreciate the suggestion, however it is on the other side of one side of the family, I personally had no say in how the dogs were mated and even how the puppies got to be raised before we got my dog (till 8 weeks old) Maybe you should think twice before being a dick to somebody just because you disagree and your views don’t align with theirs.\n\nI have learned for many years how to diffuse tense situations, my dog has been attacked twice because he didn’t want to defend himself. There was another fight at the dog park (way before we stopped taking him there) when my dog was four months old and it was in the big dogs area. Two dogs were going at it and I was about ready to hop the large fence to help and break it up when others had already gotten there.\n\nThank you again for the suggestion, but I think I know plenty about dogs, how to stop breeding (as my own dog is not fixed, I don’t allow for situations like that to happen), I am always attentive and responsible because I have to be, and considering I own a Pitbull, I know a lot of what I’m talking about.\n\nAlso, don’t go uselessly assuming things about people, just from a small tidbit of information from their lives."}

The fact they're confidently posting about it on social media, often at a young age, shows us this. They have experienced hardship, but my issue is that these people become THE spokespeople about these issues and act as if they have some amazing insight into hardship or trauma, when they truly do not. It's like someone who lives in the suburbs and saw a crime once claiming to know how it is to grow up in a violent hood, or some woman I knew who argued that hitting kids is ok and that she got it growing up - then it turned out she got slapped on the back of the hand, but was claiming to talk like she had real experience of corporal punishment (hard to imagine a guy trying to claim this, tbh, if I'm allowed to say that).

{"Article Number": 456, "title": "CANADIANS ONLY: Pierre Poilievre is going to be PM, and not only are you going to be fine, you're going to be better off than under Trudeau.", "article": "You can tell how close Poilievre is to being PM by how much Canadian reddit discussions focus on him. Now that Trudeau is screwed, and any replacements for him before an election has to be called are probably going to be Kim Campbelled, left-wing Reddit is focusing heavily on attacking him. These attacks are mostly not substantive, and this post includes a few reasons why. \n\n1. \"He has no policy/ only attacks Trudeau/ only has empty slogans!\"\n\nAs the Leader of Opposition, he doesn't have to put forth policy proposals. That isn't his job. His job is to hold the government to account. This, by nature, means that he will do more attacking the government than putting forth policy proposals. It also means he's going to do a lot of attacking Trudeau - that is his job. It's true, he's a lot more curt than other conservatives about doing it, and says mean words sometimes. This, in my view, is a good thing. Why should politics be about being nice all the time, especially when your opponent hates you, and your opponent has written the rules of engagement for the last hundred years? And considering Trudeau has done a remarkably shit job of being PM, it's good that he hits hard and plays a little dirty. Canada has had remarkably pussy-whipped conservatives for a while, and you should be thankful one of them has realized there's a market for being aggressive against a radlib Prime Minister.\n\nAlso, the slogans are working. \"Ax The Tax\" isn't the most complex piolicy proposal, but it's in your head, and you're talking about it. That's the point. Don't get mad about it, get mad that your guys aren't as good at branding. That's why Poilievre does them.\n\nAlso - he does have policy, it's just that it's not advantageous for him to reveal it now. That would make him the focus of the media cycle, and that would allow our radlib press to just deconstruct him rather than reporting on anything else.  But with that said, here's a list of policy proposals which will probably be a part of his campaign when the writ drops (sourced from ChatGPT, admittedly):\n\n**Economic Policy:**\n\n* **Balanced Budgets:** Introduce a \"pay-as-you-go\" law requiring the government to offset any new spending with equivalent cuts elsewhere to control deficits and combat inflation.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Bank of Canada Reforms:** Replace the Governor of the Bank of Canada, audit the institution, and

cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, aiming to make Canada the \"blockchain capital of the world.\"[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Defunding the

Canadians.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Housing and Infrastructure:**\n\n* **Increase Housing Supply:** Mandate major cities with unaffordable housing to boost new home construction by 15% annually, with federal infrastructure funding tied to these targets.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Utilize Federal Properties:** Sell 15% of under-utilized federal buildings to convert them into affordable housing units.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Airport Expansion:** Approve the expansion of the runway at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport to allow jet operations, enhancing competition in the aviation sector.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Environment and Energy:**\n\n* **Carbon Tax Repeal:** Eliminate the federal carbon tax, viewing it as detrimental to the economy.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Promote Green Technology:** Focus on technological solutions like carbon capture and storage to address climate change, rather than taxation.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Energy Independence:** Ban foreign oil imports and revisit previously canceled pipeline projects to boost domestic energy production.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Healthcare:**\n\n* **Support Public Healthcare:** Commit to maintaining Canada's public healthcare system.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Address Healthcare Shortages:** Implement interprovincial standardization for doctors and nurses through a \"Blue Seal\" program and expedite credential recognition for internationally trained health professionals.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Uphold Healthcare Funding:** Honor existing healthcare funding agreements with provinces, while advocating for increased funding.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Immigration:**\n\n* **Adjust Immigration Levels:** Link immigration numbers to housing availability and public service capacity, proposing reductions in asylum seekers and temporary residents to align with Canada's infrastructure.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Enhance Border Security:** Strengthen measures against illegal immigration, including amending the Safe Third Country Agreement and reinstating visa requirements for certain countries.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Social Issues:**\n\n*

matters.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Same-Sex Marriage:** Support same-sex marriage, acknowledging its success in Canada.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Drug Policy:** Oppose the decriminalization of hard drugs, advocating for increased treatment and recovery services for individuals with addictions, and propose legal action against pharmaceutical companies contributing to the opioid crisis.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Foreign Policy:**\n\n* **International Relations:** Criticize international organizations like the World Economic Forum, expressing opposition to their agendas, and propose banning ministers and top government officials from attending their annual summits. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Conservative_Party_of_Canada_leadership_election?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n  \n2. \"He's never had a job!\"\n\nThat would be a valid point if he were running against a party of people who had jobs. He is not. If you were willing to vote for Trudeau, who has nursed at the government teat his whole life, you cannot make this argument against voting for Poilievre.  And while government experience isn't ideal for a conservative, he's had a lot of cabinet positions.\n\n3. \"He's an extremist/He's a Nayzi!\"\n\nHe is not. The core of his campaign is getting rid of a tax. It's about as milquetoast of a conservative goal as you can get. \n\n4. \"He's gonna ban abortion!\"\n\nAbortion is pretty much Canada's second most sacred cow after healthcare. We made Mortengaler a member of the OOC. As sourced from ChatGPT, he won't personally touch abortion. I do concede that if he gets over 250 seats the Conservatives may have a free vote on some issue like banning late-term abortion and that may pass. That's as far as it's going to get. You're going to be able to kill as many babies for as long as you want.\n\n5. \"He's working for the oligarchs!\"\n\nThis is the best liberal point, and would be a good point if it weren't that the Liberals are also the oligarch party in Canada. In fact more so. Canada is basically a state of Oligarchs. Air Canada, the banks, the housing giants, the telecoms, the Irvings, the Westons; in Canada, these  groups and peopleare untouchable. I do think Poilievre will be better for the economy because he'll be better at reducing housing costs and forcing municipalities to build, and will probably reduce immigration at least somewhat, putting less strain on housing, but luckily  for him, he's running against an NDP which is regarded and the Liberals, who are the oligarchs. So this one's a wash. \n\nAnyways, even I am not super excited about him, but I'm not impressed because I think he isn't conservative enough, not because he is too conservative. I do think he's smarter and more competent than Trudeau, and I'm cautiously optimistic about him. Please discuss. "}

Don't worry about strategy, tactics, or skill, just hold l1 and tap r1, that's it.\n* preform a highly scripted mission sequence that does not offer any player agency or creative problem solving. Solve the problem exactly as rockstar intended\n* get rewarded with in game currency that you will never actually spend because you used cheat codes to get all the stuff you wanted already\n* Drive around a non linear sandbox indiscriminately murdering NPC's with no real character progression.\n\nAs someone who has been gaming for almost 30 years, this is just boring to me. I know GTA 6 will be no different from this. I know these games perform well with the general public, but for anyone with a refined palette towards gaming, these games are just boring."}

I've heard that at enough large scale the universe is uniform and therefore, any part of it is not different than another. Given that I do believe that there could be planets like of ours and life too; the opposite notion that we're the only species of intelligent life in the whole universe contradicts mentioned observation.\n\nThe problem lies in hypothetical interaction which we lack means of it. We can't get into spaceship and go to the aliens home as a guest. We can't communicate them through radiowaves because it takes too long in practical sense. Science fiction set the expectation bar too high. I intentionally combined two characteristics of aliens in terms of requiring them be both alive and intelligent. If we find life and it's not intelligent it could be still useful in our understanding of universe and perhaps it may help in designing environment and materials that would benefit our survival in space conditions. But it still be one way process - a man explores his surroundings, just like millions of years ago; there's no involvement of aliens as sentient beings. "}

If you calculate the pension payout, you are looking at 54% to 60% of salary replacement upon retirement. If you retire with a final income of say 80k, that is 44k per year even at 55%. Conservatively speaking, divide 44k by 0.04 as per the 4% 401k withdrawal rule, this is equivalent to a 1.1 million 401k savings. \n\nSure, your teachers will never get paid like a Google Software developer or your military field grade officers, but most people will love this pay/benefits for their jobs. \n\nNow, is the job difficult? Absolutely. But so is CDL, welding, plumbing, HVAC installation and those jobs are far more demanding physically. \n\nDoes the job require qualifications in degrees and intelligence? Sure, but I wager that mechanical/civil engineers, on average, are higher in test scores, GPA, and IQ score. Sure, you can always selectively compare STEM teachers to engineers, but I'm sorry, a math/physics degree simply isn't as marketable as any engineering ones. \n\nIs the job dangerous? Yes, it can be. But so are police, military, and mall cops.\n\nWhat I am saying is, is teaching a noble and tough profession? Absolutely. But are they underpaid? No. And the constant moaning and whining will only make the society disrespect them more when the rest of us cannot dream of a pension this generous with high job security. You can't expect the rest of us to pay even higher taxes to gift to teachers when we cannot afford our own groceries. \n\nSo teachers who feel they are underpaid should seek employment elsewhere, that is the beauty of capitalism.

This is where the root cause of 1^(st) world poverty lies; not social injustice, not lack of investment, but mere stupidity. If I were earning below $30,000 in annual income, I would cut my living expenses, switch to a high-yield savings account, utilise the S&P 500/index funds to grow my capital via compound interest; and invest smaller amounts of capital into emerging companies (such as Palantir and Nvidia). These strategies are fairly trivial/easy to implement, however I doubt those within the lower percentile of IQ can deduce much of the aforementioned advice. Low perspicacity is commonly attributed to low-intellect, making it difficult to grasp new concepts with potential to improve quality of life (such as financial knowledge/concepts). This is why I believe 1^(st) world poverty is so difficult to tackle; as the unintelligent are required to turn the cogs of capitalism, all whilst the middle and upper classes enjoy a far greater quality of life. There exists no class war, simply an intelligence war."}

Simultaneously, infusing tech workers with H1B will speed up the process of automation, R&D thereby making the United States a better, more efficient country as a whole and slowly eliminating the need for blue collar jobs that pay $10 an hour. Combined, they create the incentives to lift everyone in the United States up. Yes, the rich will become richer, but so will the United States as a whole. And unlike “trickle down economics” which doesn’t hold any water logically (the rich simply got richer period), by getting rid of illegal immigrants there is actual supply and demand forces to ensure the poorest U.S. citizens get their fair share in wages. Also true: this all hinges on theory coming together nicely in practice, but I think it stands a chance. Long story short: yes people will be screwed but these are the people that will land on their feet, at the same time we address key U.S. issues and the whole of the U.S. will be better for it."}

Subtle.\n\nBut here’s the kicker: I’m pretty sure the bottled water industry is *behind this*. Think about it. They’ve infiltrated Hollywood, turning every action hero into a hydration role model. These movies aren’t just entertainment; they’re *hydration propaganda*. Why else would a rom-com protagonist bring a water bottle to their therapy session? Or a villain pause mid-monologue to take a delicate sip of artisan spring water?\n\nAnd it’s not just the quantity...it’s the *timing*. Characters always chug water right before something dramatic happens. Are they trying to tell us that the key to surviving a car chase is preemptive hydration? Are we supposed to believe that the only thing keeping the world safe from aliens is a well-timed electrolyte boost?\n\nMeanwhile, European movies have people surviving entire plots on nothing but espresso and existential dread. No one’s running around Paris clutching a BPA-free water bottle like their life depends on it.\n\nSo, next time you watch an American blockbuster, pay attention. Spot the bottles. Count the sips.

There was a jar to leave the money and people would pay and not take the money that others left. If someone told you they would help you they would show up. If you made plans with someone they showed up. If someone said they were going to do something they would. If the person didn't do those things it got around that they couldn't be trusted and they got a bad reputation. \n\nI feel like there isn't much emphasis put on being true to your word anymore. This has led to the culture of people ghosting, people flaking on plans, and people often saying they are going to do things when they have zero intention of doing them. This leads to a lack of trust all around that hurts society. One of the fundamental building blocks of building a cohesive society is trust. In a culture without trust people assume everyone has ill intent. \n\nI believe this started when cell phones became common. Before that if you made plans you felt obligated to carry through or the person would just be waiting for you without a way to contact you. Once cell phones became common it was easier to update people if you couldn't make it. This has slowly progressed to where we are today. \n\nI really think we need to start making it important to carry through with your word again.

{"Article Number": 500, "title": "Everyone should just tip as much or as little as they want and not feel guilty about it - servers are not entitled to tips", "article": "# Introduction\n\nIt is true that the wages of servers and waiters are usually extremely low. However, remember that people choose this work voluntarily. Any given waiter or server could have instead chosen a different profession and made a much more reasonable guaranteed wage, yet they have chosen not to. Why is that?\n\nThe opportunity to get tipped is actually the primary selling point of the profession itself. It's a big reason why lots of people actually choose to be waiters or servers instead of choosing to be a different profession.\n\nObviously, some people tip more than others, and some people don't tip at all. After all, it is the customer's choice whether or not to tip. You can't force customers to tip, the same way you can't force people to work for low wages. Servers already know this, and despite that, they still choose to be servers anyway.\n\nIt is your right to tip as much or as little as you want. You also have no obligation to tip if you don't want to tip. However, that doesn't stop servers and waiters from believing that they are entitled to tips, even though that is very much a false belief. And it also doesn't stop them from gaslighting people into thinking that people are obligated to tip, even though that is very much false.\n\n# Common Arguments\n\n\"But servers rely on tips for their livelihood! If you don't tip, then they won't be able to pay their bills!\"\n\nIf that's actually true, then they would have already lost their power and water a long time ago. Plenty of customers don't tip. Plenty of servers are still able to pay their bills anyway despite that fact.\n\nIt's not your responsibility as the customer to make sure that the waiter can pay his bills. It's the waiter's responsibility to make sure that he pays his own bills.\n\n\"If you can't afford to tip, then don't go out to eat!\"\n\nThe premise of this argument is the false belief that servers are entitled to tips and that customers must tip. If you reject that false belief, you should also reject this argument. Servers and waiters are just as obligated to serve the customers that don't tip as they are to serve the customers that do tip. If you can't afford to tip, then don't tip. Don't feel bad about it either.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBy pretending like tipping is some kind of moral obligation, and feeling like you must tip every single time, you are simply playing into what the servers want. Tipping is not simply an additional benefit for the servers and for the waiters. No, it is a tool for the customers to use to their advantage.\n\nIf your server does their job properly, then feel free to tip them, if you want to do so. If your server does their job poorly, then don't hesitate to withhold the tip. Servers are not entitled to tips, they must earn them.\n\nThe real benefit of tipping culture is the power that it gives to the customer. As a customer, you have the power to decide how much your server gets paid. Don't give up that power. The worst thing to do, in my opinion, is to just tip a fixed percentage (like 15 or 20 percent) no matter how well the server did. It completely defeats the purpose of tipping, which is to put the customer in the driver's seat."}

I, for example, cannot think critically about the anthropology and origins of the Australian Aboriginals, because I know nothing about them. Are they related to the Sami people? Are they the same as Pepolonesion, however you spell that? I don't know. \n\nSimilarly, I can't think critically about the things we were given in needles around 2021-2022. I know nothing about the science of them and I'm not a doctor. So, I have to trust authorities about them, and that's why I took them. I shouldn't think critically about them.\n\nPremise 2: If you don't have the domain-specific knowledge, you shouldn't think critically within that domain.  \n  \nFor example, if you don't know the science of astronomy and planets, you shouldn't think critically about the shape of the world, because you'll probably come to the wrong conclusion if you rely on your own experience. If I look outside, and base my cosmology on what I can personally experience, the world looks pretty flat most of the time. I would end up coming to the wrong conclusion. I shouldn't think for myself on this issue.\n\nPremise 3: When we ask people to think for themselves about things they don't have the requisite knowledge of, many will naturally come to the wrong conclusions. \n\nWhen you say something, for example, such as \"trust the science\" or \"I believe in Science\", you are really saying \"I believe in the authorities which taught me facts about the world\" unless you are actually a scientist engaging in the field at an academic level, which you are probably not. \n\nWhen combined with actual skepticism of authority, you will get people who will think for themselves, and then will not know how to distinguish between the most basic facts of a certain issue, especially when it comes to an issue such as planetary cosmology.\n\nThink about it - you can't actually observe the curvature of the earth on your own. Neither can you see the curvature or orbit of other planets. Neither can you go anywhere near a star and observe that it is made of gas and isn't simply a CD underwater (there are people who believe this). So, if you think critically within this domain, and don't trust what you were taught in school, or the authorities who decided what you were going to be taught, you're going to go to people with....other ideas. Yes, I know the Greeks found the earth was round and it's curvature and radius, but you won't necessarily be that good at math.\n\nSo, in other words, you probably shouldn't think for yourself, because you can't, in most situations.\n\nPS: I believe the earth is in fact round, in case you were starting to wonder.

Maybe there's some complicated aspect of wrongful termination lawsuits that I'm not understanding, or maybe it's just my erroneous perception that companies and organizations are indeed afraid of them.\n\nWith that out of the way, everywhere I've worked for the last twenty years has had at least one irresponsible, highly ineffective individual that does not get fired or even reprimanded, and the popular explanation around the office is that the company or organization is reportedly afraid of wrongful termination lawsuits related to that employees demographic makeup. This lowers morale for anyone who cares about their work and is genuinely trying to do a good job, not to mention that anyone around these people usually has to work harder in ways that aren't even measurable to management.\n\nThere are two things I don't understand about this phenomena:  \n\nA) Companies don't want to fire staff. They want their staff to work hard, do a good job, and help the company succeed. Turnover sucks. It costs a lot of money to find and hire new employees, and you're less efficient overall when you have high turnover rates. Yet for some reason the tone of these wrongful termination lawsuits seems to be \"You wanted to fire me!\" Or \"You fired me bc I'm \\[insert demographic\\]!\" (This ties into my next point.)\n\nB) If the company or organization didn't want a certain type of person working there, then why would they hire them in the first place? \n\nThe best workplaces are the ones where everyone is working their hardest, and it's difficult to achieve this type of environment when certain people feel like they'll never get fired. Therefore, companies and organizations should not have to fear wrongful termination lawsuits, and they should be trusted to fire whoever they want, whenever they want provided they have good cause.

He never hit me, but he lied to me, cheated on me, degraded me, and played mind games. He told me that he hated me and didn't want to be with me, while also saying that he would kill himself if I left him. He was always high, and would rarely do anything unless it was something he wanted to do, or go anywhere unless he vould get stoned while there. He was an emotional toddler and I felt like he wanted me to be his mommy. He would never compromise, it was always about him and what he wanted to do. I financially supported him several times throughout our relationship, and he expected me to cover things like groceries until I finally asked him to pitch in. I could go on, but I wanted to give a little background.\n\nWhen I left him, he thought it was because I had someone else (I didnt), or because he had gained some weight (that wasn't it). He told me I was going to regret leaving him. Since then he has lost weight, and has posted his whole \"journey\" on Facebook. To everyone else, it looks like he has done well, but I know that the only reason he started to work out was for some weird kind of revenge thing.\n\nTo make it worse, I got him a job at the place I worked. He wanted to quit after being there for only 2 years because one of the people \"cleared his throat too much\" and it annoyed him. After I left him, he continued to work there, and would try to talk to me about relationship stuff when no one else was around. I ended up leaving my job because I was so sick of seeing him and having to deal with his weird manipulative tactics. For someone who likes to post online about how he was the victim, he was trying incredibly hard to get back together. I've heard through mutuals that he's now talking about leaving the job too.\n\nAll of this to say, don't judge a relationship based on the post-breakup-glow-up, because it's easy to fake personal growth online, and working out doesn't mean that the person is in any way emotionally mature."}

And yet, you do nothing—or worse, you double down.\n\nYour leaders are clowns. You’ve handed the keys to your future to sociopaths and con artists who care more about their yachts than your survival. And you let them. Why? Because deep down, most of you are too scared, lazy, or apathetic to demand better. You cling to the status quo like a life raft, even as it sinks beneath you.\n\nYou bury your heads in distractions: social media, celebrity gossip, outrage culture. You act like liking a tweet or posting a hashtag is activism, as if performative wokeness can replace real, gut-wrenching effort. You’re not changing the system—you’re just giving it a fresh coat of paint.\n\nYou let corporations poison your planet and sell you the cure.

You could overthrow the system that’s killing you, but no, let’s buy another electric car and pretend it’s enough.\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on your tribalism. Left, right, center—it doesn’t matter. You’re all so busy tearing each other apart that you can’t see the bigger picture. The elites laugh at you while you fight over scraps, too blind and bitter to realize you’re all in the same sinking ship.\n\nHere’s the kicker: You have all the tools to fix this.

Hence the only difference between you and me, is that I’m honest about my inaction and you aren't. Which returns nicely to my original claim; That I will be taking no action to mitigate climate change, nor reduce my carbon footprint.  \n\nIt all comes down to basic tragedy of the common's fallacy. The belief in a shared, finite resource of which all have access to (the environment/planet’s resources), and that everyone will ultimately act within their own self-interest to extract the most value possible before said resource is depleted. The driving force behind the fallacy, is that since we all expect everyone else to act dishonestly within their own self-interest, hence we too act within our self-interests, because why should we put in effort if nobody else will?

{"Article Number": 569, "title": "Education in the U.S. sucks because high school teaching isn't seen as a prestigious job. ", "article": "Highschool teachers may be one of the most important jobs in our society. They're not only responsible for the learning and education of hundreds of adolescents per year, they're also babysitters who have an implicit goal of trying to mold how someone functions in society in a way that's beneficial. I don't think its an exaggeration to say that outside of your family, these high school teachers are the most influential adults in your life as an adolescent. They're the adults you spend the most time around in your teens, they're the ones who serve as the mentors in athletic/education pursuits, and often times they are the ones who serve as a guide on your first steps on finding out who you want to be.\n\nDespite this, many teachers are predatory weirdos and bottom of the barrel rejects. The ones who aren't are often overworked, overwhelmed, and underpaid to the point that I can only assume they're masochists for choosing the job. The job is not looked upon respectfully by society no matter what lip service is paid by celebrities and politicians. Schools are more concerned with getting a warm body to stand in a classroom than having someone qualified teach. The district overstuffs classrooms to the point of absurdity and shuffles around known bad apples to different areas because they don't have enough teachers. Why? Because being a teacher is a shit job and we as a society don't value it despite its importance.\n\nIt doesn't make sense to me that such an important job is filled with so many unqualified and dangerous hacks and the ones who are qualified are usually treated like shit. My proposed change would be to make high school teaching an actually prestigious job instead of it being seen as borderline bum job it is now. Maybe these steps could server as a start.\n\n1. Higher pay - Pretty self explanatory, teachers are paid like shit. They should be getting paid much more. In return it should be a job that requires a lot of qualification and impeccable behavior. Being a teacher should be something to aspire to because you are paid and treated well.\n2. Stricter Requirements - With more pay, more is required. Stricter background checks on teachers and stricter rules on their conduct. I've seen too many suspect teachers skirt around. We should've be having Joe Schmo be responsible for 100s of kids every year.\n3. Stricter monitoring - This applies to both students and teachers. The behaviors of both should be held to a higher standard than what we have today. Society should let students be punished or fail but on the other hand we should also be more aware of teacher misconduct so we don't let bad apples misbehave.\n\nThese would just be a start but a societal shift in the way we view teaching would massively benefit us in the long run. Unfortunately this would probably cost billions of dollars and we all know funds won't be moved towards education and even if funds were moved it would probably be embezzled by school district presidents.

But more to the point, the work is often a lot more abstract, and the impact is often less clear.\n\nSo, people in corporate jobs may often feel that things need to be mandated by the federal government, because it's this prescribed \"work 40 hours a week with a very inflexible schedule, doing work where the impact isn't super obvious.\"\n\nLess people should go to college. We should structure society to be more of a meritocracy; part of the problem is that we are NOT a meritocracy nearly to the degree that we should be. Because the corporate world is so abstract and political, so much of the reward tends to favor those who are politically intelligent in that structure, and that doesn't always translate into better products and services.\n\nFurthermore, the government props so many companies that should have died long ago. \"Too big to fail\" is like saying a giant tumor is too big to be removed.\n\nTL;DR - Corporate America's contrived structures and perverse incentives are misaligned with meritocracy, and this drives people to support liberal economic policies where the government regulates work. If more people were independent business owners and freelancers (which I think is the ideal), the meritocracy would be more linear."}

I'm 21 and within the last 5 years I've gained and last over 5-15kg all throughout each year. Gain and lose, gain and lose.

And I lose weight in a healthy way I'm just addicted to sugar so it's never enough for me. Also, once stress hits I can never sustain it. Weight loss and gain is just so mentally taxing and I'm sick of it. I know I'm not the only one who's experienced this: having their mind be mentally taxed because of food and weight. I literally missed new year's celebrations with my friends just so I could binge eat.

But lemme just share my opinion/experience\n\nFirst of all: THIS IS ALL ABOUT FRIENDSHIP/CONNECTIONS. NOT ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS NOR FEELINGS. IF YOU CAN'T APPROACH A FRIENDSHIP OR CONNECTION WITHOUT ASSUMING SOMETHING ELSE, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU, AND I'M GENUINELY SORRY FOR YOU\n\nI'm 17. I've been in both situations. I've always had friends both older and younger than me. People my age have been consistently hard to befriend, because in my opinion most of seem too shallow. I'm going to break it down by categories, for simplicity's sake:\n\nFirst, people older than me. Since I was little, I've always been interested in stuff, mainly science, that was way beyond my age. All about atoms and cells at 5; space, geology and geometry at 7/8, etc. While my classmates were playing tag or whatever, I was chatting with the substitute teachers about random fun facts from stuff I'd learned. This is what you can POSSIBLY have in common with a kid. I felt way more comfortable/confident with them than I did with my classmates, which would never listen to me or take me seriously.\n\nAs I grew older, the age with which I felt confident around started diminishing, but eventually I had 3 or 4 close friends that were 3-6 years older than me. These friendships were incredibly important in my life. I had some really good people to look up to.\n\n\n\nMy grandma always tells me that teaching is the best way to learn. Nowhere is that more apparent than in spending time with younger people/kids. I get to be that boy they look up to, and I get to know myself better and be more comfortable with myself\n\nMy cousins are 14 and 11. They're the closest people to me after my immediate family. I know people will say \"WELL IT DOESN'T COUNT BECAUSE THEY'RE YOUR FAMILY. Ok, some of my friends from my immediate friend group are also 12/13, and I'm close with them. How is that weird?\n\nThe amount of assumptions and projections that arise from these kinds of stories are genuinely worrying. I'm not saying that the concept of maturity is relative, which is NOT, but that shouldn't dictate the stuff that you can/can't have in common as much as overall boundaries should, obviously set by both the younger and the older persons. They should also be taught more thoroughly by parents. Another example:\n\nIn a family camp I went to last year, I met a girl about 8 which started talking to me and stuff, and we kinda became \"friends\" for the remainder of the camp. What was I supposed to do, ignore her?\n\nJust be careful and you're good, for example, I refused to tickle her when she asked me, just because I didn't feel comfortable touching her, and it was not a good lesson for her. That's a boundary that a kid might not respect, but it's inalienable\n\nWhen they saw her with me, no one batted an eye. Hell, I was talking with her mother while holding her, and she even smiled.\n\nSo yeah, that should be the norm. Doesn't matter if they're older or younger, as long as it's a genuine connection without anything else, and you set proper boundaries, you're good to go.\n\nIf you don't see it like this, I'm genuinely curious as to why, so feel free to discuss\n\n:)"}

{"Article Number": 582, "title": "Immigration is a good thing", "article": "I've been seeing a lot of nativist rhetoric on reddit ever since Elon and Vivek came out in support of H1Bs, and I figured I should do something about it. At it's core, most of the arguments for restricting H1-Bs or other forms of immigration are protectionist in nature.\n\nImmigration is a good thing because:\n\n\\-they aren't actually taking jobs.\n\n\\-it leads to a more robust economy.\n\n\\-long term American birth rate decline leading to decreased tax base and looming employee shortage.\n\nEconomists have come up with the term \"[lump of labor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lump-of-labour-fallacy.asp)\" fallacy to describe concerns about immigrants taking jobs. The starting assumption for people who make this fallacy is that there is a fixed number of jobs and allowing other people to take those jobs hurts American workers.\n\nThe reality is that the number of jobs are dynamic, and based on laws of supply and demand. Jobs are created and destroyed, but positive displacement occurs when sectors become more efficient and spur greater specialization.\n\nCounterintuitively, economists have [repeatedly](https://www.mercatus.org/research/policy-briefs/unintended-consequences-restrictions-h-1b-visas) [observed](https://www.cato.org/publications/research-briefs-economic-policy/how-do-restrictions-high-skilled-immigration-affect) positive impacts from immigration.\n\nHow can this be? The primary explanation for this has been that:\n\n>high-skilled foreign workers are complements for American workers, which means that companies have some roles that they cannot fill with American workers and others that can be filled by American workers. That is, American high-skilled workers and foreign high-skilled workers may possess different skillsets that are effective when combined together. For example, to create an artificial intelligence robotics department, a company might require a highly specialized skillset that it cannot find in the United States, so it hires a foreign worker to lead the department. However, the department needs additional workers to be on the team, and these are filled by American workers. This means that when a company cannot hire high-skilled foreign workers to create the department, then the additional department jobs for Americans workers are also lost.\n\nWhat actually happens with increased immigration restrictions is that companies decide to offshore, and simply go directly to other countries to find the hires they want instead of attracting immigrants to the states. With less immigration restrictions, the long term shows greater job creation and increased productivity.\n\nBesides bring labor, immigrants bring exchange of goods and services with them and this is relevant to the next point.\n\nSeveral states are [currently facing low birth rates and will have a decreased tax base](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2022/12/the-long-term-decline-in-fertility-and-what-it-means-for-state-budgets) as a result. Simply put, a critical mass of people is needed to maintain a society and ensure that ample goods and services are provided.\n\nThat is where immigrants can come in. Immigrants don't just work, they also have to spend money on housing, food, gas, cars, clothing, etc. This also spurs economic activity.\n\nThey also pay taxes, and they can't immediately access social services. To see a practical example of how immigration helped with a population deficit, one can simply look at how [successful Singapore](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/cato-working-paper-53-update.pdf) is.\n\nSome of the above arguments, especially to those in tech, may fall flat because of layoffs. The thinking is that if there is currently an oversupply of labor, why bring in more people?\n\nTo see how ruinous this thinking be, we can look at medicine. I am simplifying the story here, but about 30 years ago there was predicted to be an oversupply of doctors. The medical field intervened, and increased the barriers to entry to try to protect physician wages.\n\nAmong many other protectionist measures in the medical field, one of those barriers entry remains how difficult it is for international medical graduates to work in the US. People who have already been trained and are competent doctors and do not need money invested in them to start contributing to the economy, often end up having to pursue allied health professions and are shut out of being doctors entirely.\n\nIn the short term, doctors succeeded. They command high wages, but this had negative consequences down the line. Today, restrictive immigration practices are one of many reasons contributing to a physician shortage. The physician shortage has wide ranging effects and looks like increased burnout, greater patient uncertainty as to when they get their next appointment, increased costs, decreased access to care for rural patients, and a general muted productivity in medicine as to what it could be.\n\nHopefully, this post addresses a lot of the arguments made on reddit.\n\n "}

In essence they are asked to put aside their religious values in the realm of politics. The problem is, religion is an axiomatic value. Axiomatic values are the thing that supersedes all other values or to put it another way it's a first principle. These are the values that undergird all others. Here's an example of a non religious axiom. \n\nPerson A: \"I support free trade\", \nPerson B: \"why?\"\n\nPerson A \"I think it's the most efficient way to allocate resources.\" \nPerson B: \"why do you care about that?\" \n\nPerson A: \"the efficient allocation of resources makes people wealthier\" \nPerson B: \"why do you care about that?\" \n\nPerson A: \"I think people are happier when they have money\". \nPerson B:  \"why do you care about that?\" \n\nPerson A: \"I think it's good when people are as happy as possible\"\nPerson B: \"why?\" \n\nPerson A: \"happiness is good\"\nPerson B: \"why?\"\n\nPerson A: \"umm....\"\n\nPerson A has an axiom which is that happiness is good. There's nothing more underlying that position. In the same sense if you're a Christian your underlying value is obedience to Christ above All Else. Every political decision, every policy, every ideology, must serve that end. If you really believe that what you do is in the service of God then considerations like human rights or the free market or whatever else we're debating kind of become irrelevant. The question then just becomes what would God want. And I don't really see how that's any different in principle from a non-religious axiom like \"happiness is good\". "}

This person varies, but often it goes as far as someone's parents or close relatives (except children). Hilariously, one discussion I saw today was how retail workers shouldn't have to tell customers their names because they don't owe them that information. Lol. Today's wisdom is that we are disconnected, autonomous islands, with no responsibilities towards others if we don't voluntarily take them on.\n\nI believe this is wrong in a cosmological sense and is a society-destroying if actually enacted. You can't have a society in which there are no social obligations between people. We already have that substantiated in law, but outside of legal matters it's important as well. For example, you may be able to tell I'm going through online dating, and the ghosting we have in today's age is a point of consternation for me and for many. I think this is due to a breakdown in how we see social responsibility. If you really don't have any obligation to anyone, then ghosting is totally fine...but we all know literally nobody likes it. So, if you don't want to see someone, you probably have some level of obligation to say so, **Provided they gave you the initial respect that you should receive as a human by at least showing politeness and obeying whatever the social norms are for online dating.**\n\nBecause I don't want this to be about just online dating, there are posts on reddit, typically the relationship focused ones, about cutting people off, including parents, and people will cut off parents for basically no reason, and the comments are often like \"Yeah! F those guys! You don't owe your parents shit!\". Well, no. You don't owe your parents the world, you can't pay them back for your food and education as a child, and they can't ask for that in any reasonable world, but if you're going to cut your parents off, you'd better have a good reason. \n\nThe reason I say everyone is that, for a society to function, there has to be some guarantee of mutual respect, and I think that has to go beyond \"leaving people alone\". Yes, in most cases you should leave people to their business. But as a Christian, I can't see street people and think \"Eh, not my business\". We owe them something as a society, even if they are strangers. \n\nI propose this: For a society to function, **respect is something** ***owed by you*****, to others.** Yes, it is still conditional, but it is not earned.\n\nPlease discuss.

However I disagree.  Not because the sentiment is bad, but because there is no point in taxing the rich because the math just doesn't work out.\n\nSo, let's do some math.  There are currently 801 billionaires in the US.  This represents 28.8% of all billionaires in the world, a substantial number given that the US only makes up 4.2% of the worlds population.  The 801 billionaires have a combined net worth of 6.22 trillion.  And because I'm not screwing around, let's seize all their assets.  All 6.22 trillion of them.\n\nThat is enough money to fund the US government for roughly 1.05 years.  That's it.  The US Government spends 6 trillion per year currently (and keep in mind this number historically has only been going up).  So in exchange of removing all billionaires from society (and scaring off literally every single wealthy person by doing so (need some evidence?  Look at the rate of capital flight from the UK over the past decade)), you managed to fund the government for just over a year.  Wow.  Good job.  And this is assuming you somehow not only manage to get this passed but also manage to successfully seize all their assets, which is in stocks, bonds, companies, cash, overseas accounts, real estate, and more.\n\nThere isn't any point to it.  The US spends too much.  The only feasible way out is reducing government spending enough to balance the budget (which means cutting 1.5 trillion a year), and that's never going to happen."}

While the people being honored by the new names are certainly deserving of the honor, such a big 180-degree flip on the name where the new honoree is the exact opposite of the original honoree makes me think that the institution only honored them in order to make a statement about the original names, and that they didn't view them as worthy of honor in their own right by having their names placed on either a new building or place, or something that had previously been unnamed, and the existing building's being renamed for something completely unrelated.  In other words, the new honorees are being shortchanged by being a convenient way to dispose of an undesired name, and are second-best by only being chosen for the honor after bad people were removed.\n\nSame goes for the Columbus Day/Indigenous People's Day debate.  I feel like indigenous people should have a holiday recognizing their contributions to society.  But by redesignating Columbus Day as that day makes me think that they aren't considered worthy of the honor in their own right, but are only seen as a convenient way to dispose of a holiday named after an historical figure that is no saint, thus giving them Columbus' used holiday.  If you want to designate a holiday for indigenous people, great - create a new holiday on a new date, and eliminate the old holiday as a separate thing.\n\nIn other words, if someone is as worthy of an honor as you think, give them the full honor by placing their name on something new, and not as an obvious reaction to a bad name."}

I honestly don’t blame you for feeling like existence itself is a cruel joke. Because it is.\n\nRomance is what makes life bearable. It’s the proof that, even in a world filled with greed, hatred, and suffering, there’s still something worth fighting for. But if you've never had it—never felt what it’s like to be someone's *one and only*—you're left in the dark, trying to convince yourself that your hobbies, career, or self-love are \"enough.\" Spoiler alert: they aren’t. Family and friends aren't even as important as romance.\n\nSeeing couples walk by, happy and *whole*, while you sit on the sidelines of life is a type of torment no one talks about. You’re not just lonely—you’re *less*. Less human, less important, less worthy. Everyone says, “Oh, you’ll find someone someday,” like that’s supposed to keep you going. But let’s be real: some people *don’t*. Some people die having never felt what it’s like to be loved and that's a fate worse than any deadly disease. \n\nAnd you know what? That’s a valid reason to be depressed. Love isn’t just a “bonus” to life—it’s the main event. Without it, the world is just a series of gray, pointless days, leading inevitably to death. No one’s going to remember you. No one’s going to miss you. You’re a spectator in a game you’ll never play, and when you finally leave, the world will keep spinning like you were never here.\n\nPeople will tell you, “Focus on yourself first.” Yeah, sure, but to what end? You can work out, get rich, and achieve every goal you set, but it all feels hollow if there’s no one to share it with. We’re wired to connect. Denying that need is like trying to survive without food or water. It’s unnatural.\n\nSo yeah, if you’ve never experienced romance, you have every right to feel miserable. I would too.

In fact, you could very easily make your problem worse by assuming this, or offering advice to this effect.\n\nIntimidation will only get a bully so far. Eventually, they have to back it up. And if they're still bullying people later in life, it's pretty safe to assume they know how to back it up.

It's when the show calls out the poor people who think they can magically become rich. Honestly, I think it's one of the most truthful messages I've seen in any show, especially one that’s aimed at a wider audience.\n\nIn real life, your dreams won’t come true. Sure, we all hear about the lucky few who hit the jackpot or get that big break, but that’s rare. It’s not something that just happens to most people. People aren’t out here to be your friends or to help you either. Everyone’s just out for themselves, and you’re left scrambling for what you can get. If you’re lucky, you might get a hand up, but don’t count on it.\n\nLet’s face it, you’re probably destined to have a pretty shitty life. You’ll struggle to get by, and things won’t always work out the way you want them to. Marriage? Who knows. Maybe you’ll get married, maybe you won’t. But that’s just another part of life that might disappoint you. At the end of it all, you’ll die, and all those big dreams, the goals you thought you could achieve, will probably seem kind of ridiculous.\n\nGood things won’t just happen to you, and success? That’s something that’s just out of reach for most. That’s the harsh truth of life that I think people, especially kids, need to hear. Too many shows paint this picture of hope and success that’s simply not realistic. *Squid Game* is one of the few that’s keeping it real, telling you that the odds are stacked against you, and you have to learn to deal with that. Kids need to understand that, instead of constantly being fed lies about how everything will work out in the end. Real life isn’t about being handed opportunities—it’s about surviving and making do with what you’ve got."}

Women I’ve dated or invited over are shocked at how neat and clean my home is, with many expressing how ashamed they are of their own space in comparison.\n\nThat made me realise that it was not me being irresponsible that caused my ex-wife’s mental load, but my ex-wife’s expectation on me being able to read her mind when she was wanted things to be done. I was perfectly capable of doing every single chore, and I would have done more than my fair share when I needed to, but there was no way I could consistently anticipated her needs and when she wanted things to be done.\n\nSo when I read yet another article about wives and girlfriends complaining about their mental load or how they do more at home, all I need to look at is at the state of my home versus the state of most single women’s to get my answer.

In reality, our cruelties and kindnesses are ordinary and the central reasons for our behavior is no different than any other life form. All life struggles for limited resources and we as humans are just another among billions in that competition. Chimps and ants fight, hunt, and struggle for food, territory, safety, and comforts. Despite all the sophistication of our modern society, we do the same. We perform labor for money (a social representation of resources) and use that money to buy territory, food, luxury, and the necessities of nature. \n\nSci-fi media in particular is especially egregious with this delusion, often times having humans be the nexus point of an entire galaxy filled with alien species who jerk off how special human beings are.

", "article": "Apologies for the tired subject but I felt like I wanted to put this thought into words somewhere. \n\nOftentimes I get the impression that other pro choice advocates either don't want to talk about this at all or significantly downplay its impact. We have to be honest with not only those who disagree but also ourselves. \n\nFirstly, I'm a dude, so my scope is obviously limited by that factor. However, an abortion is ultimately a procedure to remove a thing that will eventually become a human being, and further, somebody's child. It is absolutely not out of the question in my view that even if a woman determines abortion is the right decision and something that is not immoral, there may be still some sense of connection and a sense of loss, shame or grief that can be experienced from losing that connection, both internally and externally from society. Pregnancy and birth are things that are highly regarded and respected universally by basically all human beings, and the body begins the production of influential hormones as soon as implantation occurs. This can be a very difficult time emotionally for a lot of people, and we shouldn't be afraid of respecting and addressing that. It may feel like ceding ground to the pro life side, but it's actually one less gotcha in their toolbelt when debates occur. \n\nAdditionally, abortion is a somewhat invasive medical procedure that can be very uncomfortable physically, and poses risks like any other procedure. From another psychological end, it's a whole drive to some clinic you might not have even been to before, it can be quite expensive, and there's probably a bunch of weird creeps screaming at you and holding signs plastered with medical gore in your face. However, and my experience here is extremely limited but to my knowledge/limited experience, I have never heard anything bad about the staff at these clinics. In basically every instance I've heard of and experienced, these people are immensely supportive, empathetic, willing to work with you on the financial side, and very professional. \n\nI don't want to knock the clinics themselves at all, especially given all the other immensely important services places like Planned Parenthood provides. But still, even if you trust your surgeon, going into surgery can be an emotionally daunting proposition and can be kinda scary because it's so infrequent for most people, and I don't see why the same wouldn't be true for an abortion.

You could get STDs without being a sex worker.\n\nPeople say, \"You wouldn't want your daughter/mom/sister to be a sex worker/porn star.\" Well, most people probably wouldn't want their kid to work at McDonald's their whole life either. But it's not like it should be illegal to work at McDonald's. And part of that is probably because sex work is stigmatized/unsafe anyway. Maybe people wouldn't care as much if it was seen as a respectable job. Also, a lot of the people saying that, are probably the same people watching porn themselves ironically.\n\nThe last argument I've heard people make is that, if you are a sex worker/pornstar, you are contributing to an immoral industry that hurts society. But this could go for a lot of jobs. If you work for McDonald's, you are helping make people fat. If you work for a healthcare company, you are helping them take advantage of sick people financially. If you work for big pharma, you are helping people get addicted. Etc. Also, it seems kind of hypocritical to say this but consume porn yourself since the demand drives the supply. (There would be no sex workers without customers.)\n\nIf anything, prostitution seems like an easier job for more money compared to most jobs (if you're a high-end sex worker, that is). I don't see how it's much worse than someone having to do construction or join the military or something."}
{"Article Number": 674, "title": "Most Palestine supporters just want to vent their underlying antisemitic views.", "article": "First, I would like to mention that not all Palestine protestors are antisemitic; although I do believe around 60% of Palestine protestors hold some form of antisemitic viewpoint. The basis of my argument, is that for as far as I can remember, gaining any form of political traction as an antisemite was almost impossible. Hence, they were shunned to the sidelines, with only the most fringe of political ideologies backing them and failed to mount any serious support. However, the near overnight rise of the pro-Palestine movement has effectively enabled these previously fringe groups, access to the mainstream media/public eye. This has created a strange dynamic, by which we witness both leftists (e.g. antifa, AOC, B LM) protesting alongside the likes of Alex Jones and Nick Fuentes. I for one can’t think of a time in recent history where it was socially acceptable to share any of the opinions held by Alex Jones, except for now. What’s next, leftists watching info-wars and screaming about how sandy hook was a fraud? I also find issue with a statement commonly passed around in leftists circles that “it’s not antisemitic to be anti-Zionist\". By extension, said leftists are supporting the abolition of the world's only Jewish state, yet simultaneously claim there not antisemites? Anyone who holds this belief clearly either doesn’t properly understand what Zionism is/it's implications; or most likely hold some form of underlying antisemitic views. Hence why I believe that if you support Palestine, there is a likelihood you hold antisemitic views. "}

{"Article Number": 686, "title": "Life in solitary confinement is a better punishment than death penalty", "article": "Death penalty is both extremely cruel and extremely lenient in my opinion. It is cruel to those who have ended up on a false conviction as you can not reverse a decision once the falsely convicted has been executed and lenient for people who actually commited a horrible crime.

And besides, horrible criminals show no mercy and would not care if they were executed.\n\nWhich is why life in solitary confinement is a more suitable punishment for the worst of crimes. Not just any solitary confinement though, It has to be a white room with padding all around so they don't hurt themselves, lights on 24/7, soundproof room, white clothing, white bland food and nothing inside. basically anything to completely deprive their senses. It is lenient because at the very least if you are falsely convicted, You have a chance to get out and it is suitable for a punishment for actual criminals as they get to feel the consequences for their actions without them actually getting physically hurt in the process.\n\n\"But the CIA does that to interrogate people!

{"Article Number": 689, "title": "Part of the reason why women are so disappointed with modern dating is because way women evaluate men doesn't work for selecting an equal relationship.", "article": "This may be confusing, and I don't mean to paint women here with an overly large brush, but some generalizing is necessary. I'll establish the points, which I believe will be mostly agreed upon. We'll start by saying that I'm talking about women seeking men. \n\n1. Women looking for men nowadays find the men they do find disappointing often. You will see \"the bar is on the floor for men\" stated often, by a certain type of person. This may be because of points 2 and 3, which are:\n\n2. Women are desiring more equal relationships than in years past where the income and household work splits are closer to 50/50.\n\n3. Women are still seeking men that will make firm relationship commitments to them. This means monogamy (except where it doesn't, but we aren't talking about those people), and men who will define the relationship firmly, without unnecessary ambiguities. We're talking about women looking for marriage here, at least eventually, which is still a lot of women. \n\n4. Outside of those things, women still want a man who is handsome, has good social skills, dresses well, is in good shape, and earns a strong income, has career drive and ambition, and wants to take care of her, all other things being equal. I may get pushback on the \"takes care of her\" point, but I think many will still find this to be true.\n\n5. Women like it when a man takes charge in the early stages of a relationship, which means asking the woman out, setting the dates, paying for them, and other things. The thing which made my thoughts click is when I saw one woman on online dating say \"Bonus points for you if you can tell me how to dress on our first date\".\n\nI haven't written it out in enough detail to state it simply enough, but I believe what I've come to understand is that women find disappointment because the things they look for in men don't translate to equal relationships. \n\nIn other words, point 1 is basically in contradiction with points 2 through 5. Take the last example I gave in point 5. Having a man tell you how to dress for your first date is pretty patriarchal, no? If you're asking for that, you are telegraphing a patriarchal relationship, and you are selecting for men who will want a more patriarchal relationship. Having a man plan things out for you and pay is 1). telegraphing that you want a man to be in charge of you, and 2), telegraphing that you are an \"item\" that needs to be paid for.\n\nOn point 4, there are a few things. A guy with better social skills will be more socially dominant and less likely to take on the woman's traditional roles in a relationship. A guy with more income will be more focused on his job and will be less inclined to do housework. Additionally, men used to be able to dress well because they had stronger male role models who told them how to dress. If you want less male dominance in society, you would have to accept that there would be fewer male role models around to morph men into the man you would want them to be, and you'll have to take on more of the responsibility. This is admittedly my weakest point. \n\nOn point 3, one of the things which has remained from patriarchy the hardest and which seems to want to go away the least is that the man defines the relationship status, once the woman lets there be one, of course. Think about this; the one thing that the man still pretty much *always* does in a relationship, even now, is be the one to ask the woman to marry him. Feminism has changed much, but it doesn't seem to have changed this. If it's the man's responsibility to do the asking, that puts the power in the man's hands to define the relationship, which is pretty patriarchal.\n\nI'm getting long winded at this point. I think I've figured out a simpler way to state it; as long as you, as a woman, are seeking a relatively modern relationship, but are using the tenets of more traditional masculinity to find a man for that relationship, you are in conflict. \n\nThis has also helped me realize that part of the animosity between men and women is that the statement \"The bar is on the floor for guys\" is sort of true...once the guy is in the relationship. It's definitely not true for  guys who aren't in a relationship already. \n\nINB4:\n\nNo, I am not an i-word.  \nNo, this does not justify i-word rhetoric.  \nNo, this does not justify hating women (or men, for that matter).   \nNo, I am not saying that women should go back to the kitchen, or that we should go back to the 1950's or before.   \nNo, men are not trash.  \nNo, women are not trash.  \nNo, I am not saying you as a woman personally want patriarchy. I am saying that many of the things you may want in a man or in a relationship may be vestiges of patriarchy.   \nNo, I am not saying patricarchy is good.\n\n  \nThank you all and Happy New Year."}

{"Article Number": 695, "title": "Subreddits that don’t enforce their own rules should be banned or have their ownership relinquished", "article": "Reddit is absolutely drowning in political bickering to the point where it's borderline unusable.

If a subreddit can’t maintain its intended purpose, it shouldn’t exist in its current form.\n\nEvery subreddit seems destined to fall into the same trap. No matter the topic—be it skepticism, joe Rogan, or gardening—someone inevitably posts an inflammatory political take that has no place in the community. And when moderators turn a blind eye, these posts become normalized. Instead of thoughtful discussions or niche expertise, the subreddit turns into yet another battleground for partisan shouting matches and links to partisan news articles.\n\nLet’s be clear: this isn’t about censorship or saying politics doesn’t matter. It’s about maintaining the integrity of spaces dedicated to other things. Political content might belong in subreddits designed for it, but when it invades unrelated communities, it derails conversations, drives away users, and erodes the quality of the platform.\n\nI can already hear someone furiously typing, “Everything is political!” And you know what? You’re not wrong. If someone wants to discuss how the current economy is affecting camping supplies in a camping forum, that’s completely understandable and even relevant. But let’s be honest—that’s not what actually happens.\n\nInstead, half the site ends up recycling the same worn-out jokes, memes, and takes that boil down to little more than, “The other team is bad.” It’s lazy, it’s off-topic, and it adds nothing to the discussion. These posts don’t contribute to the subreddit’s intended purpose; they just turn it into yet another echo chamber for partisan sniping.\n\nHere’s a simple solution:\n\t1.\tIf moderators consistently fail to enforce their own subreddit’s rules—especially against irrelevant political content—they should lose their ownership.\n\t2.\tOwnership should pass to active, responsible moderators, or the subreddit should be archived entirely.\n\t3.\tThis would force moderators to take their responsibilities seriously, ensuring subreddits remain focused on their original purpose and not yet another soapbox for political arguments.\n\nThis issue isn’t just annoying; it’s a rot that spreads across Reddit. The more subreddits allow themselves to be hijacked by off-topic political content, the more the platform as a whole loses its value as a space for diverse, topic-focused communities. If a subreddit can’t uphold its rules and protect its identity, it’s time for Reddit to step in.\n\nYes, this opinion might rub some people the wrong way, but subreddits are supposed to be about fostering community, not turning every discussion into the same exhausting, never-ending political argument.

It has laid bare the deep-seated hatred toward immigrants (Indians in this case) the majority of Americans have, which is largely not economically motivated, no matter how much people would like you to believe it is."}

You get what you perceive as a good work ethic from your hires... ok sure, they work long hours because deportation is the alternative usually. But even if it is a little exploitative it's not as exploitative as like child slave labor or anything. They sign up, work like dogs for the ability to live like kings back home usually, it's cheaper. No pesky expectations from the worker like with US based ones trying to push salaries or benefits up. They want to get in, get theirs, and get gone most of the time. You can see them in that office, no work from home demands here. Or they're providing for a family back home, same logic but longer term hire there. Or they actually want in? Perfect storm, someone who aspires to citizenship will work like that dog and not go away.\n\nBelow that line? Whether you can explain how or not you can tell the program lowered wages in your industry in the short term at least, probably killed some upward mobility for you, and you view it just like open borders is viewed by the working class. Same with outsourcing. It is nothing but down side for you. You know it's not about high skilled labor they can't find because your younger relatives just graduated with some useful degrees and can't even get interviews. And the tech sector laid off gajillions of people not long ago anyway, it's not like they disappeared into space. They want \"hunger\" and instead of paying properly for it they want to import it on the cheap. Your grandson isn't hungry enough. He has expectations like getting his own apartment, having days off, and maybe some are even unrealistic expectations... like never having to deal with being on call. But instead of meeting in that middle and both sides benefitting they just kicked him out.\n\nThe class divide on this one is really really going to make the next term interesting. MAGA is going to find out... who will Trump listen to when he has no re-election to worry about? The donor class? Or the base? As this issue goes so goes the whole 4 years I'd guess.\n\nThat's about all I had to say on that. It's one to keep an eye on."}

And you know what? I’m *happy* it’s shaking up the art world. All those elitist, white-collar “real” artists who act like their work is some holy grail are finally getting a taste of reality—and they deserve it.\n\nFor years, these so-called “artists” have looked down their noses at everyone else, gatekeeping creativity like it’s some exclusive club. They’ve made art all about cliques, galleries, and overpriced BS that no one but rich people can afford. Meanwhile, the rest of us are left trying to make sense of a squiggle on a canvas or, better yet, a *banana duct-taped to a wall* that costs six figures. Seriously, that was their idea of \"art.\"\n\nNow AI comes along, and suddenly *anyone* can create something jaw-dropping without having to spend years learning how to hold a paintbrush or wasting money on art school. And guess what? It’s pissing off all those pretentious artists who think their “process” is more important than the actual result. Newsflash: nobody cares how many hours you spent crying over your canvas if an AI can create something ten times better in five minutes.\n\nThe funniest part? These artists are so delusional they’re out here crying about some made-up \"soul\" nonsense, as if art needs to have magical fairy dust sprinkled on it to be valid. Spoiler alert: art is about what you feel when you see it, not how much the creator suffered for it. Half the “art” hanging in galleries already feels soulless anyway, so spare us the dramatics.\n\nThey also whine about AI \"stealing\" from them, but let’s not pretend humans haven’t been ripping each other off for centuries. Every artist is inspired by someone else—it’s how creativity works. AI is just doing the same thing, but faster and without the whining.\n\nSo yeah, AI art is better. It’s faster, cooler, and way more accessible. And the fact that it’s flipping the art world on its head? That’s just the cherry on top. If you’re one of those snobby artists who’s mad about it—good. Maybe it’s time you got off your high horse and joined the rest of us in the real world.\n\nCry harder. AI isn’t going anywhere.

But dig a little deeper, and they’re just as selfish, petty, and self-serving as everyone else.\n\nTake those people who are always talking about how they \"just want to help others.\" Yeah, they *might* do some nice things, but half the time, they do it because it makes them feel good about themselves or gives them some social points. If you think they're doing it purely out of kindness, you’re kidding yourself. Everybody wants something in return, even if it's just the warm, fuzzy feeling of thinking they’re a \"good person.\" Most people will put on a mask, but take it off, and they’re just looking out for #1.\n\nEven the ones who claim to have \"good intentions\" or are always preaching about love and peace? They’re usually the most judgmental. They won’t hesitate to tear down someone they think is “less than” or \"not good enough.\" And let’s not even get started on those who say they don’t care about money, fame, or status. Yeah, okay. We all care. Everyone cares. It's hardwired into us. No one's above it.\n\nAnd don’t even talk about the \"heroes\" of the world—the ones who save lives, donate to charities, whatever. They’ve got their own dark corners. No one’s perfect. People are so damn quick to judge others for being selfish, but then they turn around and make excuses for their own bad behavior. Everyone’s just hiding behind some version of \"I'm a good person, I promise.\" But if you really look closely, you’ll see the cracks. You’ll see their flaws.\n\nAt the end of the day, we’re all just out here trying to survive, and in that process, we screw people over without even thinking about it sometimes.

At a faster rate than the people who are entering the work force.\n\nSo this will mean that we have to generate more money for the ageing retirees' benefits from a decreasing workforce which leads to higher and higher taxes on the working class making it unbearable for young working people to live their own lives with upward  financial movement.\n\nAnd because of the falling birth rate, it'll mean the old people are the bigger voting bloc and will force politicians to cater to their s even at young people's expense so policies that I crease tax to fund welfare will get passed.\n\nThis will lead the young working to have even less kids because they'll be overworked and the negative feedback looks will be sealed.\n\nThere are 3 solutions to this, both suck for somebody :\n\n1. Reduce the rate of people who qualify for welfare benefits by rasing the retirement age so that more peopne keep working and your system isn't strained as much.\n2. .Abolish the Retirement  SSI Sytem or reduce the number of benefits it contains for retirees so that everyone has to keep working for themselves and those that retire aren't a big  burden on the government and the young working class gets taxed less..really everyone gets taxed less here.\n3. Increase the number of people entering the work force via immigration or increasing the birth rates. Immigration is a stop gap solution that doesn't work in the long term since 2nd generation Americans follow the same birth tends as 3rd+ gen Americans.\n\nThe only way to increase the birth rate with current technology is to regulate abortion and birth control access. Advanced capitalistic nations in Scandinavia have tried all kinds of state birth incentives that failed. The only way to make people have mkre kids is to narrow the gap between sex frequency and pregnancy frequency.

The only extra lore bits is that she has an even crazier sister. We despise Arcane and everything it stands for. It's flawed from the concept. I despise Arcane because it's another example of people having to make every villain \" UWU I'M SYMPATHIC FEEL BAD FOR MEEE! \", and it's so extremely tiring. What happened to characters just being crazy or chaos loving for the sake of it? Jinx was Riot's version of Harley Quinn. And she worked. Simple, crazy, and that's it, nothing else needed. But now she can't be seen as anything other than the giant shadow the series casts on her. Not to mention the people that watch Arcane stay far away from League, further disrespecting the source material and  not understanding the character at all. It's the over complicating of everything, it's the bastardization of everything. People love the Joker because he's just that, an embodiment of chaos, anarchy, and mayhem. He causes destruction just because he wants to see the world burn. We don't have a whole ass game focused on how he became the Joker. He just is. And any development he's given is AFTER he's the Joker and it's focused on his relationship with Batman and how they both need each other to give each other purpose, it's the Yin and the Yang, it's deep and worth exploring. And what's worse is League is INFAMOUS for neglecting about half of their cast in favor of a select few popular favorites, and the characters of Arcane are just that, Jinx, Caitlyn, are very popular characters. So many other champions have a story genuinely worth expanding upon and exploring, but not they choose the already established and fine as is characters and give them more for no reason.  Side Note: I despise the Joker film because it tries to make you sympathize with Joker, but..he's just a guy that society treated him like shit, but so fucking what? Society treats MILLIONS like shit but you don't see millions going around murdering people do you? No. So he has absolutely no excuse, especially because countless people have had it so much worse than him, so he's just a pathetic sorry excuse of a human lashing out with no justifiable reason.

{"Article Number": 744, "title": "You all need to stop using the word propaganda because you fundamentally don't understand what propaganda is or how it works. ", "article": "Let me break this down for you in plain terms. Hello, former 37F - US Army Psychological Operations Specialist here. When I say I know what propaganda is, it's because I literally made it. We just don't call it propaganda—only \"the enemy\" does that.\n\n\n\nNow, let's kill some myths.\n\n\nMyth One: \"They're all brainwashed.\"\n\n\n\nWrong. I can't brainwash anyone. No one can. I can’t make you think, believe, or act in a way that's against your core nature. You know why? Because propaganda doesn’t create new beliefs—it amplifies what's already there. People don’t magically adopt ideas; propaganda works by exploiting bi@ses, fears, or inclinations that already exist. It provides justification, not transformation. People won’t act contrary to their nature, and propaganda doesn’t overwrite that—it just directs it. That’s why it’s a convenient scapegoat for bad behavior: \"It wasn’t me, it was the propaganda!\" Or, as they used to say back in the day, \"The devil made me do it!\"\n\n\n\nMyth Two: \"I’m too smart to fall for it.\"\n\n\n\n((Laughs in psy-op)). Oh, sweetheart, no. Your arrogance makes you an easy target. All I have to do is stroke that ego of yours. Flatter you. Tell you you’re special, enlightened, smarter than \"those other idiots.\" I’ll tell you you’re on the right side of history, and they’re the bad guys. Sound familiar? You’ll eat it up because it feeds your ego, and before you know it, you’re parroting the same points I designed for you.\n\n\n\nMyth Three: \"Only those people fall for propaganda.\"\n\n\n\nNope. Everyone is susceptible to it. You, me, everyone. Why? Because propaganda is just targeted marketing. It’s tailor-made to appeal to your wants, needs, fears, and desires. You think you’re immune because you’re logical, but I’m not going after your logic—I’m going for your emotions. Because if I can get you to feel, you’ll forget to think. That’s the whole game.\n\n\nFast food ads? That’s propaganda. They don’t sell burgers; they sell happiness and family moments. ASPCA commercials? Same deal—they trigger guilt and compassion. It’s all about emotional manipulation. Even neon signs are propaganda in a way—they’re designed to catch your eye. It’s everywhere, and it works because it’s made for you.\n\n\n\nThe Truth About Propaganda:\n\n\n\nI’m not trying to convert everyone. That’s not how it works. I’m not going to turn a vegetarian into a steak lover with my steakhouse ad. But that’s fine—I’m not talking to vegetarians. I’m targeting the people who already love steak. I’m showing them sizzling steaks, happy diners, and good times. I’m tapping into their existing desires. I’ve already accounted for the people I won’t reach. What matters is getting enough of the right people to bite, and I will.\n\n\nSo no, propaganda isn’t some all-powerful force that magically rewires brains. It’s just psychology, marketing, and knowing how to push the buttons you already have. Everyone is vulnerable to it—especially those who think they aren’t."}

{"Article Number": 748, "title": "Reddit is a Liberal Echo Chamber", "article": "Reddit’s upvote/downvote system creates a self-reinforcing cycle that favors popular opinions, and since Reddit leans heavily liberal, it ends up becoming a liberal echo chamber. The way the system works—by summing upvotes and downvotes—means that the most \"agreeable\" comments rise to the top. If a comment doesn’t align with the predominant viewpoint, it gets buried, regardless of how well-reasoned or factual it might be.\n\nTo make things worse, Reddit’s infrastructure itself isn’t as decentralized or democratic as it seems. Did you know that **92 of the top 500 subreddits are controlled by just 4 people**? These mods wield an immense amount of power, essentially deciding what conversations can and can’t happen in massive communities like politics, worldnews, news. The implications are obvious: this concentrated control allows for a heavy bias in content moderation, often skewing towards liberal perspectives while censoring or suppressing dissenting views. It’s like a gatekeeping mechanism disguised as a free platform.\n\nNow let’s talk about how this plays out with non-liberal polarizing figures like Elon Musk. Love him or hate him, there’s no denying that Reddit has a knack for spinning anything related to him into a negative narrative. A perfect example is the controversy surrounding Starlink in Ukraine. When SpaceX provided **free** Starlink service to Ukraine, the agreement explicitly stated that it would be used for humanitarian purposes, like providing internet to hospitals and civilians, and not for military operations. However, when Ukrainian forces couldn’t use Starlink in a specific military zone for an offensive, Reddit threads were filled with accusations that Musk deliberately sabotaged Ukraine’s efforts by \"shutting down\" Starlink.\n\nThe truth? Musk didn’t “shut down” anything—SpaceX never agreed to enable Starlink in those zones in the first place. Despite this, Reddit narratives ignored these facts and painted him as someone undermining Ukraine’s war efforts. This kind of narrative framing conveniently skips over the massive humanitarian contribution Musk’s Starlink made in the region while focusing solely on a misleading spin. Redditors also speculated that Musk was Pro-Russia. It was later revealed Russia was trying to hack Ukraine's starlink systems but this was defended by SpaceX.\n\n**This isn’t about whether you support Musk or not—it’s about how the system amplifies certain viewpoints while demonizing others. When you combine the upvote/downvote mechanics with concentrated mod control, you get an echo chamber where alternative perspectives struggle to gain traction.**\n\nReddit isn’t the bastion of open discussion it pretends to be, and the sooner we acknowledge that, the better.\n\nPrediction: This post gets deleted or heavily downvoted. Please remember this sub is for \"unpopular opinions\"."}

{"Article Number": 755, "title": "Many traits of \"emotional intelligence\" are just conditioning from a relatively privileged life experience of prior positive interpersonal experiences", "article": "I was reading Dan Goleman's book about emotional intelligence (EQ). It describes EQ as:\n\n1. *Knowing one's emotions*\n2. *Managing emotions*\n3. *Motivating oneself*\n\n*4. Recognizing emotions in others*\n\n*5. Handling relationships*\n\n**He also describes high EQ men/women as:**\n\n\\-Outgoing, cheerful, assertive, feel positive about themselves, socially poised, life holds meaning for them, adapt well to stress, express their feelings directly, not prone to fearfulness or worried rumination, sympathetic, good capacity for taking responsibility, caring in relationships.\n\n**And described low EQ men/women as:**\n\n\\-Critical, inhibited, condescending, unexpressive, detached, emotionally bland, prone to anxiety, prone to guilt, prone to rumination, hesitant to express their anger directly\n\nThe \"high EQ\" descriptors mostly sound like the result of positive previous interpersonal experiences, while the \"low EQ\" ones mostly sound like the result of negative previous interpersonal experiences. Anyone can be cheerful, assertive, feel positive about themselves, feel life has meaning and have good practice of feeling and expressing emotions, if they've been encouraged by others in the past and have a dearth of discouragment. If someone is repeatedly shamed, rejected, ridiculed, has their needs or opinions trampled on or is outright assaulted, they will not be as carefree or impassioned in life, or as well-practiced in feeling emotions or expressing emotions. Partly because they'll learn to reflexively suppress emotions due to their only emotions being painful ones and partly they'll supress their emotions and display of emotions because they need to stay safe and displaying certain emotions is not safe in their environment - but unfortunately the reality is often \"use it or lose it\" (at least temporarily).\n\nUnlike the aspects of intelligence that IQ tries to measure, the description of \"emotional intelligence\" (EQ) doesn't seem to be anything innate or even close to stable. Rather, it seems to be much more the result of a privileged upbringing or life, rather than any actual intelligence. IQ can be negatively affected by things like stress or depression, but for that we're talking about maybe a 10-15% decrease, while with EQ I'd say you could see a near-100% decrease from stress. Let's say you physically and sexually torture somebody in a prison for a few years and tell them it's what the world thinks they deserve and mock, shame or punish them for any emotional reactivity, and let's say you have their primary caregivers and family partake in it too - I think you could achieve a near 100% decrease in EQ after a while, but nowhere near the same decrease in IQ.\n\nIt would be very difficult to take a high IQ person, with innately high empathy from birth, and turn them into a low IQ person according to Goleman's description, without delivering some major physical brain damage. However, it would be quite easy to take a high EQ child or even high EQ adult, and turn them into a low EQ person, purely through harsh treatment or social rejection and without any physical brain damage.\n\nI found it a little ironic that he's calling people who are shy or have been conditioned to be emotionally closed off \"emotionally unintelligent\" - IMO this viewpoint lacks the EQ to realise that people are emotionally affected by their prior life experiences or intolerant environments or that not everyone expresses emotions or empathy in the same way, and that cultural conditioning is part of this - for example, different cultures use different amounts of verbal and non-verbal cues when talking. For example, native Japanese-speakers tend to [backchannel more frequently](https://www.reading.ac.uk/elal/-/media/project/uor-main/schools-departments/elal/lswp/lswp-3/ell_language_6_cutrone_vol_3.pdf?la=en&hash=778C39577A775742F47009ACDEAA81B3) (ie say things like \"I see\" or \"hmm\" while listening to speech) than English-speakers during conversations, whether speaking in either Japanese or English. Japanese also focus on different facial cues compare to Americans - [they focus more on the eyes, rather than the mouth](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103106000321) and receive more communication via the eyes (here's a Japanese language teacher [talking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MJSZn8voDo) about it).\n\n"}

Does the TSA confiscate cell phones and never give them back? Also, I believe that policies around phone use in school should be enforced by teachers during the only time where it directly matters, not during breaks as some kind of apprehensive move around brain development. \n\nPermanent confiscation is civil asset forfeiture for the crime of being young. \n\nThe rules aren’t the rules.

The right has been using a strategy called \"The 2 Santa Strategy\" that was developed and actually put into practice during Reagan's presidency (right around when the wealth gap began and continues to explode, funny that). The \"2 Santa Strategy,\" which you can fact check me if you would like, involves recklessly spending and instituting financial policies that will offer short term boosts to economic performance in exchange for massively inflating the debt and causing long term economic harm. Then when they are no longer in power, they relentlessly point out the economic damage and blame it on the left. \n\nThere's also the \"Starve the Beast,\" Strategy that goes hand in hand with the previously mentioned. This plan revolves around intentional sabotage of government programs or departments until they are completely ineffective, then once they have gutted it to a nonfunctional shadow of its intended purpose, they can cry about how poorly these things are handled and cut it's funding for their own gain, either through the privatization of these programs or just completely erasing them to make room for new tax cuts, which oddly always benefit the rich more than the poor. \n\nImmigration: Trump got up on stage one day and started completely making shit up about immigrants, saying counties were just emptying their prisons across our border, throwing a wave of rapists and killers at us, but that's complete bullshit you guys gobbled right up. Not only do immigrants perform crimes at a lower rate than natural born US citizens, but they are essential for the continued functioning of our economy. They not only provide massive amounts of labor that US citizens do not want to do, but they pay into things like Social Security and Medicare without ever pulling any benefits from those programs for themselves. And if you want to point out that they are undercutting the wages of US citizens, who's fault is that really? I know you are smart enough to figure out that they aren't in charge of their own wages, it's big companies that are more than happy to shaft their employees and pay poverty wages to these people seeking a better life.

{"Article Number": 780, "title": "Call of duty: modern warfare 2 (2022) was a good game", "article": "like the title says. I really enjoyed modern warfare 2, and I think that it was actually really good, and I will provide a couple reasons as to why\n\n1. Campaign - I thought the campaign's story was alright, but I really liked how it played out. the mission \"alone\" was one of my favorites, honestly. Recon by fire is a close second. the way they implemented the sniping, and made it so you can get a different angle to get 2 kills at once was in my opinion really good. Then we have the mission dark waters (oil rig), which i thoroughly enjoyed due to how the cqb plays out (no run-and-gun, more slower paced and methodical). and then the final mission which I thought was also pretty neat. In my opinion, it could've been better, but it was something a bit different, as you had an objective to complete while trying to hide and fight back against hassan.\n\n2. Multiplayer - easily one of the best multiplayers of the last few cods (yes, i understand OG cod is really good, but i'm talking about MW2019 and onward). the maps were alright, but I think the gunplay is what I really enjoyed (will get into it in the next point) the gamemodes were amazing. we had a co-op gamemode AND DMZ. the coop was something new, and I think honestly there should be more like it in the newer cods, as I enjoyed playing through it. being able to play as a team in a non-sweaty setting was very fun. DMZ was also something new. a softcore extraction shooter. it was something that they should've kept updating. being able to unlock weapons through DMZ gave you extra incentive to play. Not only that but it being a good way to level up your guns, as well as it just being fun in general through the side quests in the game, and the missions you take before you go in, made it really fun. it was completely different, something that no other COD had, which gave you another reason to buy the game, other than FOMO (fear of missing out).\n\n3. Gunplay - slower movement paired with lower TTK (time to kill) made the game less sweaty. people complained about campers, but I think a bigger problem with newer cods is these movement demons. it makes the game unplayable if people with no job have mastered the ability of running around you at light speed and using a finisher on you. the gunplay in this game made the possibility of that happening very unlikely. The game was also pretty beginner friendly (in my opinion atleast), because there wasn't too much of a learning curve, meaning that new players could get into the game and not die 80 times the instant they load into their first multiplayer game. the focus on realism, too, made it more fun. it wasn't a hyper-realistic tactical shooter, but it was a significant improvement than what came before (vanguard and coldwar- although, i did like coldwar's gunplay, it felt a little bit too arcade-like for me). although COD is an arcade shooter, it brought in a little bit of realism and made it into something new. it was something a little bit more serious in the era of nicki minaj and snoop dogg running around (which honestly i think people over-reacted at). the guns feel amazing to shoot, and the gunsmith, while complicated, was still (in my opinion) somewhat fair, while also being pretty detailed. an un-upgraded gun was still pretty usable, the upgrades (as the name suggests), made them better, but didn't transform them into a completely different gun (atleast from what i've seen). \n\n  \nTL;DR, MW2022 was a good game due to the campaign adding more unique missions, the multiplayer giving us new gamemodes, and the gunplay being less sweaty\n\n"}

I'll put it this way; yes, I have seen the many advantages of working remotely, particularly for people with kids, but I think that for the average early-career professional, working 5 days a week in the office is better. In fact, I think that working fully remote in your early career is probably a career killer, to some degree. You simply don't maintain the same types of relationships when you work remotely. And in your early career, developing relationships that can benefit you in the long term (such as a mentor) is really crucial for giving you direction and guidance. \n\nI know that you're going to all say you can still develop these relationships online, and that's true, but I do believe there's something missing when you only do remote work. I think that Redditors will heavily underestimate the differences and advantages that come with organic interactions at work in person that don't exist when you always communicate by Zoom.\n\nAnd I think the one thing I really do believe that will be the most controversial is that there's something truly beneficial to you as an individual to being forced to wake up early, take care of your appearance, and commute, at least a bit. No, it isn't always amazing, but I think that forcing yourself to put in more effort creates a community of people more willing to put in that effort. I know you're going to rage on me for this, those of you that will; I don't care.\n\nNote that I don't think there aren't benefits to remote work, but I think they're overstated, especially on Reddit. \n\nAlso I think if you're in-office the executives should be in office as well.\n\nAnyways, that's my 2c.\n\nPS: Posted to Unpopularopionon, removed immediately.

But then some of these same women will also act like a man so much as talking to, looking at or touching them the wrong way is a violation of their sacred chastity.\n\nNow look at the family court system. It's *still* set up as if women are totally helpless without men's money and personal property. I mean, we obviously know this isn't the case. And at the same time, we allow women to initiate a divorce because they just feel like it or \"aren't happy\". This no fault approach wS never part of the traditional structure.\n\nI think we've reached a point where feminists need to commit to one lane or the other.

This mythos has lasted and became embedded into the culture. Christmas movies have since followed or paid tribute to this mythos ever since. A person loses faith in humanity and becomes greedy and bitter. Through a supernatural or magical force the person is made to realize that the spirit of giving and generosity, empathy and gratitude over all else can overcome humanities struggles. This is embodied by Tiny Tim. \n\nIf you look at the all time great Christmas Movies this mythos is present. \n\n**The Grinch** is Scrooge, Cindy Who is Tiny Tim. \n\n**National Lampoons Christmas Vacation** : Clark's boss is scrooge and Clark is Tiny Tim. \n\n**Elf** : James Caan is scrooge and Will Farrell is Tiny Tim. \n\n**Office Christmas Party** : Jennifer Aniston is scrooge and TJ  Miller is Tiny Tim. \n\n\nCertain films can modify this concept but always include it.  For instance, It's a Wonderful Life. James Stewarts character is not Scrooge although he questions humanity. But Mr. Potter is Scrooge.  Tiny Tim is actually the Guardian Angel. \n\n**Christmas with the Kranks** has it.\n\n \n**The Holdovers** has it. \n\n**Trading Places**has it. \n\n**BAD SANTA** has it. \n\n\nbut **Die Hard** does NOT have it.  You could argue that Hans Gruber is the scrooge character but he isn't turned back to humanity by Bruce Willis. You could argue that Bruce Willis is scrooge but that would make Hans Gruber tiny tim?!?!?!   It doesn't make sense in the Christmas Mythos, and therefore is simply an action movie that takes place during the Holidays.   \n\nThe key clue is that the time of year plays no part in the plot of the film. It could take place any other time of year and still work. \n\nSidenote: Love Actually is also not a Christmas movie for the same reasons."}

The way I see it is this. So many people have dietary restrictions for both religious and other reasons.\n\nFirst of all, as far as religious are concerned, so many kids have dietary restrictions here. For instance, Jews and Muslims are pescatarians except for Kosher or Halal food respectively. Or Hindus, who are often lacto vegetarians because that is their parents' faith. This is rightfully allowed because it's basic religious freedom to raise the kids under your faith. But also, it is basic freedom generally to raise kids under your values even if not religion based.\n\nAlso, there are other reasons for kids to eat a restricted diet. The biggest example I can think of is celiac. No bread, no pasta, usually no oatmeal, no crackers, no cookies, but somehow parents of kids with celiac are great and awesome but vegan parents are these demons? I don't think so. \n\nI kind of see veganism's morality as a middle ground. The case behind it is not strong enough where vegans have a right to claim that EVERYONE should be vegan but there are strong enough evidences that vegan diets can be healthy to the point I can be ok with people choosing it for themselves and their children.

Even if you're in the top 10% of human memory capabilities, your memory sucks.\n\nThere's too many cases where you tell someone something like \"hey, can you bring plates to the potluck that's 3 weeks away?\" They agree, then completely forget because they didn't write it down anywhere. They were completely dependent on someone else reminding them or just hoping they remembered it themselves as the date got closer.\n\nIt can be anything, like here's some examples:\n\n* Returning borrowed items (e.g., books, tools, or containers).\n* Replacing a lightbulb or fixing a minor repair.\n* Getting your tires rotated or changed.\n* Calling or texting someone back.\n* Paying a bill before the due date.\n* Submitting a report or project by a deadline.\n* Booking or rescheduling a doctor’s or dentist appointment.\n* Filing expense reports or timesheets.\n* Bringing snacks or drinks for a kids’ activity or sports event.\n* Picking up dry cleaning or alterations.\n* Sending a thank-you note or follow-up after a gathering.\n* Vacuuming, sweeping, or tidying up a space.\n* Scheduling an oil change or car inspection.\n* Replacing batteries in smoke detectors or remotes.\n* Backing up data or saving work before shutting down a computer.\n* Returning a library book or rental.\n* Mailing a letter or package.\n* Bringing materials for a presentation or discussion.\n* Ordering or restocking supplies.\n* Picking up groceries or specific ingredients for dinner.\n\nNearly everyone screws up these basic tasks because \"woops I forgot\". And the only consequence is inconveniencing other people, so they don't care to change their ways.\n\nThe solution is extremely simple. Just have a go to place to reference for things you need to get done. Like a phone calendar, or alarms, or go old-school with a physical pen and notebook. It really doesn't matter what your method is, as long as it's not your memory, because brains suck at remembering things on their own. And by doing this, you drastically increase your reliability. Not only as a co-worker, family member, friend, but just an overall person.", "authorship": "human"}
{"Article Number": 27, "title": "\"Just Do It\" is actually pretty great advice.", "article": "I feel like every week I get some kind of personal development email that starts with \"tHeY tell you to 'just do it' as if it were that easy, but you and I know that never works, and that you need a new, deeper approach that gets to the heart of the problem.\"  And then follows whatever random thing about scheduling, intention setting, coaching, community, or whatnot is for them the secret sauce.\n\nThe fact is, \"just do it\" actually works really well.  For example, if you think about the workplace.  I've worked in a variety of industries.  Some places had good training.  Some had none.  Some employees were highly motivated and had a samurai like mentality of excellence.  Some literally did not give a shit except for money.  However, the vast majority of employees who just showed up and did their job for six months or more became skilled at their jobs.  Simply the fact of showing up and doing something almost every day, where you have an obvious incentive to master it to at least some extant, and unlimited opportunities to observe what works and what doesn't, gets most people to a point where they can do something decently.\n\nWhen I think about things in my life I wanted to do and either something happened or not, the secret sauce usually was \"just doing it\".  For example, I had a period where I was really interested in chess.  I decided to \"just do it\" and start playing in tournaments.  This meant that I was now talking to other chess players (community), getting coached by better players, hearing others talk about their routine.  Interacting with others, I got clearer about my intentions.  After a while, talking to one of my coaches, I realized that I wasn't that passionate about chess as I'd hoped and felt a need to take care of other priorities, which while sad, was again learning about my real needs and priorities.\n\nSo in essence, \"just do it\" contains everything in a nutshell, because when you really make your mind up to do something difficult for you and start putting in the work, you will learn all the other things.\n\nWhereas honestly, for me usually when I fail to make progress, it's because I make excuses, either just normal \"it's not the right time\" type excuses, or for me, engaging in an infinite number of preliminary personal development exercises, reading, psychologizing, or otherwise searching for some magic key (including magic) that will make things simple.", "authorship": "human"}

If you crash going 150mph no matter what you’re fucked, but if you do it in a 2 ton mustang everybody around you is also fucked. \nAlso the fact that you likely won’t have passengers. It’s way too common for some idiots to think they can race with their friends in the car and wrap it around a tree.\nReason 2: (Debatable) More fun\nMotorcycles are so much more visceral than cars. The feeling of the wind, manoeuvring your whole body to corner.

{"Article Number": 148, "title": "Splitting expenses relative to income level (or merging incomes and expenses, which is basically the same) is not fair", "article": "*Disclaimer:* ***I'm not saying that splitting 50/50 is fair.*** *It's also unfair, for other reasons. I think that there is no fair system. I just think that the argument \"it's only fair for the person who earns more to pay more of the expenses\" is wrong.*\n\nI'll use an extreme example just to illustrate my point. Let's consider person A and person B. When they were 20 years old, both had a passion for art. Both had the exact same opportunities open to them. Let's even say both are the same gender, same race and same socio-economic background to eliminate any argument about systemic discrimination.\n\nPerson A decided that pursuing a career in art was too risky because it's very unlikely that you would make a good living out of it. So they decided on another life plan. They chose to sacrifice their twenties. They started to study finance: they enrolled in a prestigious school, took on tons of st\\*dent d\\*bt (had to censor that because of automod), and spent 5 years studying very hard. They then got a soul-crushing job at 25. By the time they're 30, they have changed employers twice because that was the best way to get a raise. They didn't care about getting a fulfilling job; they only cared about making as much money as possible and living way below their means so they could retire early and make up for their lost twenties in their forties.\n\nAt 30, person A has a net worth of 0 because they only just paid off their st\\*dent d\\*bts. They have 0 friends because they changed job so frequently, they never formed any meaningful connection. They work a job they hate. However, they are making $150,000 a year. They are living a lifestyle well below what they could afford, with only $30,000 in expenses, so they can save 80% of their income and hope to retire before 45.\n\nPerson B decided to pursue their passion for art because they value experiences over financial security. They studied at a cheap community college for a few years, then found a job as a graphic designer. It didn't pay much, but it was fulfilling. They kept the same job, and their colleagues became close friends. Since they were working a fulfilling job, person B never had the plan to retire early. They took advantage of their twenties to have fun, travel, go to music festivals every year, and made even more friends like that.\n\nAt 30, person B also has a net worth of 0 because they never saved. They have multiple close friends, and have experienced many cool things in life. They are making $40,000 a year. They also have $30,000 in expenses.\n\nNow, they meet each other, fall in love, and move in together. Let's say that their combined expenses would now be $50,000. If they split expenses based on income, person A would pay $39,500 ($9,500 **more** than they used to pay when they were single) and person B would pay $10,500 ($19,500 **less** than they used to pay when they were single).\n\nI think that's unfair. The only reason person B is earning less is because of the **choices** they made in the past. It's not because they were unlucky or something. Person A sacrificed many things during their twenties, expecting it would pay off later. Effectively, person A is giving away to person B the results of half the sacrifices they made (and are continuing to make since they still hate their job), while person B had to make no sacrifices.\n\nNow maybe both of them are fully aware about it, and they are fine with it, then perfect. Maybe person B makes up for it in other ways, or maybe person A just doesn't care and is happy to share the sacrifices they made with their loved one. But people who say \"it's only fair\" are wrong. It's not fair.\n\nI just used an extreme example to illustrate my point. Even if the difference is smaller, the point still stands. If person A was earning only 10% more than because they made 10% more sacrifices, it would still be unfair for them to cover 10% more of the expenses.", "authorship": "human"}

People also seem to generally consider a person not wanting to be punished as a sign that they lack remorse and aren’t willing to change, when I don’t think this is really the case the way people think it is.  A person can be willing to be punished while being unwilling to change their behavior, and a person can try to avoid punishment while still admitting to themselves that what they did was wrong and that they need to change.  It seems like often the default view people have seems to be that the reason someone would do something wrong is that they think they can get away with it when often times that’s either not the case or it’s more complicated than that.  I think if someone needs consequences in order to not do something wrong then there’s other reasons they’re doing something wrong that aren’t being addressed.  Actions having consequences aren’t really where values come from the way people often think they do, as things like empathy, and the desire to live in a functioning society, as well as modeling others is how people really get their values.

With a leather wallet that has traditional sleeves, removing the intended card was super easy, barely an inconvenience. With ridge, it is more annoying, in particular if the card is not at one end or the other. Leather wallets form to the space they are in, whether they are in your back pocket, front pocket, breast pocket, whatever. The ridge is a solid square. The ridge wallet damages credit cards on their corners. The ridge wallet also scratches whatever else it comes into contact with in your pocket or other carrying device. So you have your key fob for your car, wallet, and phone. Now my keys go in my back pocket, and I have to remove them to sit down.

It’s a wake-up call about the risks of too much technology in our lives and a reminder to stay active and engaged with the world around us. This portrayal is slowly becoming our reality as we become more dependent on devices and automation. The movie encourages us to reflect on our habits and consider the importance of staying connected to the world and each other.", "authorship": "human"}
