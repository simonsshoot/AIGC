No one knows exactly when or where, but it is certain that California will experience more wildfires and Florida will experience more hurricanes, especially as global warming exacerbates these climatic consequences. Considering this, states and localities should bear the burden of planning for and repairing the damage from these circumstances.\n\nIt is fundamentally unfair that people who live in more safe and sustainable regions of the country must subsidize the dangerous development patterns of those who choose to live in disaster-prone areas. It is also short-sighted because it incentivizes less resilient settlement patterns, meaning more people are harmed and displaced by disasters in the future. Many people affected by recent disasters likely wouldn't have been there and therefore would not have suffered in the first place if the risks were appropriately priced--both California and Flordia have kept home insurance artificially low for years. Or their homes wouldn't have been destroyed because the proper pricing of insurance would effectively necessitate more durable designs.\n\nTo the extent the federal government provides any aid for predictable natural disasters, it should either be as a loan to smooth out the cost shock or as an insurance plan individual states buy into which is calibrated to its region's risk level. We already intuitively understand this as fair for quasi-predictable events that affect individuals: the federal government doesn't come running to buy you a new house if you neglect to buy homeowners insurance and a pipe bursts, flooding it. For healthcare, too, we either expect individuals to buy personal insurance plans or, in countries with universal/public coverage, negative externalities on risky consumption are appropriately taxed to offset its societal cost (eg taxes on alcohol, tobacco, fat, sugar etc.).\n\nWhere I do think the federal government should offer aid is for disasters/emergencies that are truly unforeseen like a meteor strike or a terror attack. Otherwise, it is doing more harm than good to promote reckless population growth in the most disaster-prone regions of the country."}

{"Article Number": 41, "title": "CMV: For straight married couples, you shouldn't have friends of the opposite sex.", "article": "I've made a few comments on Reddit previously that get downvoted a lot because of my position on this. That makes me believe that maybe I should change my position.\n\nWhen you're a straight individual and are married, you should not have friends of the opposite sex. The number one reason for my position on this is affairs. **Time and time again, people fall into affairs because there's a small fracture in their marriage and a friend fills the void.** It usually starts innocent enough - meaning, people don't plan to have the affair. It's simply a friendship. But for a few of reasons, it turns into something more.\n\n1. **You trust the friend.** This often leads to sharing private information about your marriage with them and often leads to asking for advice about your marriage. This begins the slippery slope of bonding over a situation where the friend genuinely wants to help you, and you need their emotional support.\n2. **The friend likely knows or has met your spouse.** Similar to the point above, this is comforting for you because the friend will better understand the problems you are having in your marriage because they are familiar with your spouse.\n3. **Your spouse is comfortable with you talking to this person already.** This allows communication to happen 'in plain sight', because the foundation has been laid that you and the friend are allowed to communicate, with or without the spouse present. Even when communications become 'more than friendly', you feel less guilt because your spouse knows that you're 'just friends' with this person. It reinforces the justifications you are already having to make about the emotional connection you share with this friend that has gone beyond that of a friendship.\n4. **The negative information you're giving the friend about your spouse encourages the friend to do/say the opposite of your spouse, making them appear better suited for you and you start to compare your friend and the spouse with each other.** I'm not sure if there's a technical name for this phenomenon, but in short, you're giving the friend a cheat code for how to be a better partner for you than your spouse. For instance, you say, \"Every time I try to talk to my spouse, he hijacks my story and makes it about himself and never tells me he understands.\" The friend promptly responds with \"I understand, that must be really hard for you.\" Now, it's a great response by the friend, but also an opportunity to continue to drive a wedge between you and your spouse with the information that *you* provided. The friend feels needed and appreciated, you feel understand and heard, and again - the relationship continues to develop into something far beyond a friendship. This isn't based on a real connection, but rather opportunistic behaviors by the friend who is now attached and leverages the information you've provided them to develop a deeper connection with you. \n5. **The relationship with the friend is easier to maintain that the marriage; no bills/money to argue over, no children to interfere - just an emotional connection that may develop into something sexual over time.** As mentioned in the previous point, nothing about this is more 'real' than your marriage - in fact, it's everything but. But your once friend now has a halo on and you're fantasizing about running away together to escape your marriage problems with the person you made your vows to.\n\nThe above points show why this happens even when you didn't plan on it, and why it continues even after you realize it's happening. Being friends with the opposite sex during a marriage may be well intended but often ends up as something more than you planned. \n\nChange my view that straight couples shouldn't have friends of the opposite sex.", "authorship": "human"}

I'm not necessarily supporting taking a big chunk of change when someone is left ten grand by an uncle.

A weird parallel of this would be Sprint Football. Interestingly this doesn't look super different as a product with just the lineman being small vs small. Would small basketball be just this?\n2. There was a league called World Basketball League. It had a pretty high height restriction (6'6). Having watched one game, can't say it looked very different.\n3. It potentially is a mistake to think of the sport only as the highest level professional sport and not as a huge system.

I think a lot of the confusion about his statements starts from there. I was raised Christian (still am, but was raised that way too), but I think if you're not really familiar with the Christian worldview, or at least an Abrahamic one, which isn't materialist, that's a stumbling block for many to understanding what he's talking about. \n\nHis ideas often also leave room for interpretation, which can lead to misunderstandings. For example, his discussions on hierarchies, order vs. chaos, and the importance of traditional structures can be interpreted in vastly different ways, depending on your perspective. What I've found with people who find him hard to understand or hate him is that he takes the perspective that hierarchies are necessary, in the sense that they will always exist because they are a part of nature, as an attempted justification of the hierarchies exactly as they are now. Peterson's definitely a conservative, but most of his work is about how we can't get rid of hierarchies in general, not that hierarchies should never be altered. \n\nIt's also true that when he talks, even about a simple question, he often starts talking about things in multiple disciplines, linking psychology to sociology, biology, and literature too (guy loves Russian literature and the Bible). This makes his arguments complex, layered arguments that require listeners to follow long trains of thought. This can be difficult if you want a simple answer, which is frustrating for even me (like you talk about God all the time Jordan, how can you possibly tell people you don't know what they mean when they ask you if you believe in Him?), but it doesn't mean he's full of shit. It makes him a university professor (try reading Lacan if you want a hard read). He deals with questions at a very deep level. \n\nBasically, you can call him totally wrong and evil if you want, I don't care that much. He's not me. But it's not like he makes no sense. I think people who think he makes no sense just want a really quick, snarky answer, and that's not always the right way to be. Sometimes you need someone like him to really think deeply about something. \n\n", "authorship": "human"}

Can’t we just agree that supporting any hostile power makes you a sellout to your nation? It’s like everyone is trying to find evidence to suggest trump’s a Russian puppet, while several members of the democratic party, such as rashida tlaib, ilam omar and AOC support Palestine (a nation where on 9/11 people were recorded chanting “death to America”), and yet the media isn’t even concerned! I personally think supporting Palestine makes you just as big a puppet as supporting Russia; as constantly trying to push foreign interests to the detriment of your own nation is shameful.\n\nAlso, who’s to say Hamas doesn’t directly fund western politicians into supporting them? Hamas is surprisingly well funded, due to their vast foreign real estate, cryptocurrency and fraudulent charity networks; as well as aid from the likes of Iran and North Korea. Hence in my opinion, any western leader who supports Palestine warrants an immediate investigation into their finances/donors. I personally believe that at least 70% of western politicians whom support Palestine have some sort of indirect funding incentives, curtesy of Hamas and its partners."}

", "article": "Highschool teachers may be one of the most important jobs in our society. They're not only responsible for the learning and education of hundreds of adolescents per year, they're also babysitters who have an implicit goal of trying to mold how someone functions in society in a way that's beneficial. I don't think its an exaggeration to say that outside of your family, these high school teachers are the most influential adults in your life as an adolescent. They're the adults you spend the most time around in your teens, they're the ones who serve as the mentors in athletic/education pursuits, and often times they are the ones who serve as a guide on your first steps on finding out who you want to be.\n\nDespite this, many teachers are predatory weirdos and bottom of the barrel rejects. The ones who aren't are often overworked, overwhelmed, and underpaid to the point that I can only assume they're masochists for choosing the job. The job is not looked upon respectfully by society no matter what lip service is paid by celebrities and politicians. Schools are more concerned with getting a warm body to stand in a classroom than having someone qualified teach. The district overstuffs classrooms to the point of absurdity and shuffles around known bad apples to different areas because they don't have enough teachers. Why? Because being a teacher is a shit job and we as a society don't value it despite its importance.\n\nIt doesn't make sense to me that such an important job is filled with so many unqualified and dangerous hacks and the ones who are qualified are usually treated like shit. My proposed change would be to make high school teaching an actually prestigious job instead of it being seen as borderline bum job it is now. Maybe these steps could server as a start.\n\n1. Higher pay - Pretty self explanatory, teachers are paid like shit. They should be getting paid much more. In return it should be a job that requires a lot of qualification and impeccable behavior. Being a teacher should be something to aspire to because you are paid and treated well.\n2. Stricter Requirements - With more pay, more is required. Stricter background checks on teachers and stricter rules on their conduct. I've seen too many suspect teachers skirt around. We should've be having Joe Schmo be responsible for 100s of kids every year.\n3. Stricter monitoring - This applies to both students and teachers. The behaviors of both should be held to a higher standard than what we have today. Society should let students be punished or fail but on the other hand we should also be more aware of teacher misconduct so we don't let bad apples misbehave.\n\nThese would just be a start but a societal shift in the way we view teaching would massively benefit us in the long run. Unfortunately this would probably cost billions of dollars and we all know funds won't be moved towards education and even if funds were moved it would probably be embezzled by school district presidents.

But more to the point, the work is often a lot more abstract, and the impact is often less clear.\n\nSo, people in corporate jobs may often feel that things need to be mandated by the federal government, because it's this prescribed \"work 40 hours a week with a very inflexible schedule, doing work where the impact isn't super obvious.\"\n\nLess people should go to college. We should structure society to be more of a meritocracy; part of the problem is that we are NOT a meritocracy nearly to the degree that we should be.

I guess sounding like a broken record is entertaining to some people \n\nThis brings me onto another point, people mention his bars are very insightful and some people have even referred to him as the modern day socrates but whenever I ask someone to give me 5 bars where it is actually well thought out, they struggle and can’t say 1. Before anyone says A minor, what else does he have?

{"Article Number": 314, "title": "CMV: People being shirtless in crowds at concerts are inconsiderate.", "article": "I’ve been to too many concerts where I end up pressed against a shirtless guy and I get covered in a sweaty slick. I’m not naive, I know people sweat and clothes are wet and getting pressed against sweaty people is inevitable. But there is a distinct difference between touching sweat absorbed into clothing (even if the clothing is saturated) and being pressed into sweaty skin. It’s like being pressed against a 200 pound snail.\n\nEven wearing a tank top is better than someone shirtless because at least the main mass of their back and chest has some type of layer. Tank tops aren’t perfect but I’m willing to accept that. But it’s preferable to have sleeves so armpits aren’t out either, especially if you’re a person that spends a lot of time with your hands in the air.\n\nThis doesn’t just apply to men, women sweat too. Women wearing just bathing suit tops in crowds is the same thing. \n\nThere’s also a lot of unclenliness that goes along with bare backs and shoulders. Acne is one. As someone that suffers from a decent amount of body acne, I would be mortified if I was rubbing back zits against strangers that are shoved up against me. \n\nIt’s not the appearance of someone topless that bothers me. I’m a proponent of body positivity and if you’re comfortable being shirtless at a festival out of the crowd because you’re trying to cool down then it’s no problem. But if you’re gonna get in the crowd where you are going to be smushed against people, I believe it’s considerate to put on some type of shirt or top.\n\nA point a friend of mine raised is what about bald people, they sweat through their heads, must they wear hats? My answer is it’s not inconsiderate to be bald without a hat in a crowd because that’s a hairstyle that for many is inevitable or they shave it for personal reasons or whatever. I can live with that. Heads are also significantly smaller than a torso and generally more sanitary. Same thing for arms and legs. \n\nEdit: thank you everyone for participating. Though I still consider it a personal pet peeve and would love for wearing shirts at concerts/festivals to become a norm for my own personal reasons, I have conceded and awarded deltas for two reasons.\n\n1. Not enough people have raised this as a legitimate problem for it to become a social norm that people should wesr shirts. If it’s not a social norm then someone cannot be aware of it and decide to violate it anyway. Thus, it can’t be deemed “inconsiderate” per se.\n\n2. Someone brought up that there are really small venues where you can’t really avoid being squeezed together and they can get really hot. This means that someone pretty much cannot choose to take their shirt off outside of the crowd if they’re getting too hot. Since it’s pretty much an unavoidable occurrence in this case, it counts as an exception. Since I made a blanket statement insinuating that it’s always inconsiderate, the exception means my view has been technically kind of changed. I still think people should wear shirts in crowds at festivals and large concerts, but for the sake of the wording of my original view I awarded a delta.\n\n", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 456, "title": "CANADIANS ONLY: Pierre Poilievre is going to be PM, and not only are you going to be fine, you're going to be better off than under Trudeau.", "article": "You can tell how close Poilievre is to being PM by how much Canadian reddit discussions focus on him. Now that Trudeau is screwed, and any replacements for him before an election has to be called are probably going to be Kim Campbelled, left-wing Reddit is focusing heavily on attacking him. These attacks are mostly not substantive, and this post includes a few reasons why. \n\n1. \"He has no policy/ only attacks Trudeau/ only has empty slogans!\"\n\nAs the Leader of Opposition, he doesn't have to put forth policy proposals. That isn't his job. His job is to hold the government to account. This, by nature, means that he will do more attacking the government than putting forth policy proposals. It also means he's going to do a lot of attacking Trudeau - that is his job. It's true, he's a lot more curt than other conservatives about doing it, and says mean words sometimes. This, in my view, is a good thing. Why should politics be about being nice all the time, especially when your opponent hates you, and your opponent has written the rules of engagement for the last hundred years? And considering Trudeau has done a remarkably shit job of being PM, it's good that he hits hard and plays a little dirty. Canada has had remarkably pussy-whipped conservatives for a while, and you should be thankful one of them has realized there's a market for being aggressive against a radlib Prime Minister.\n\nAlso, the slogans are working. \"Ax The Tax\" isn't the most complex piolicy proposal, but it's in your head, and you're talking about it. That's the point. Don't get mad about it, get mad that your guys aren't as good at branding. That's why Poilievre does them.\n\nAlso - he does have policy, it's just that it's not advantageous for him to reveal it now. That would make him the focus of the media cycle, and that would allow our radlib press to just deconstruct him rather than reporting on anything else.  But with that said, here's a list of policy proposals which will probably be a part of his campaign when the writ drops (sourced from ChatGPT, admittedly):\n\n**Economic Policy:**\n\n* **Balanced Budgets:** Introduce a \"pay-as-you-go\" law requiring the government to offset any new spending with equivalent cuts elsewhere to control deficits and combat

housing to boost new home construction by 15% annually, with federal infrastructure funding tied to these targets.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Utilize Federal Properties:** Sell 15% of under-utilized federal buildings to convert them into affordable housing units.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Airport Expansion:** Approve the expansion of the runway at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport to allow jet operations, enhancing competition in the aviation sector.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Environment and Energy:**\n\n* **Carbon Tax Repeal:** Eliminate the federal carbon tax, viewing it as detrimental to the economy.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Promote Green Technology:** Focus on technological solutions like carbon capture and storage to address climate change, rather than taxation.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Energy Independence:** Ban foreign oil imports and revisit previously canceled pipeline projects to boost domestic energy production.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Healthcare:**\n\n* **Support Public Healthcare:** Commit to maintaining Canada's public healthcare system.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Address Healthcare Shortages:** Implement interprovincial standardization for doctors and nurses through a \"Blue Seal\" program and expedite credential recognition for internationally trained health professionals.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Uphold Healthcare Funding:** Honor existing healthcare funding agreements with provinces, while advocating for increased funding.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Immigration:**\n\n* **Adjust Immigration Levels:** Link immigration numbers to housing availability and public service capacity, proposing reductions in asylum seekers and temporary residents to align with Canada's infrastructure.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Enhance Border Security:** Strengthen measures against illegal immigration, including amending the Safe Third Country Agreement and reinstating visa requirements for certain countries.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Social Issues:**\n\n*

Canada.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Drug Policy:** Oppose the decriminalization of hard drugs, advocating for increased treatment and recovery services for individuals with addictions, and propose legal action against pharmaceutical companies contributing to the opioid crisis.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Foreign Policy:**\n\n* **International Relations:** Criticize international organizations like the World Economic Forum, expressing opposition to their agendas, and propose banning ministers and top government officials from attending their annual summits. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Conservative_Party_of_Canada_leadership_election?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n  \n2. \"He's never had a job!\"\n\nThat would be a valid point if he were running against a party of people who had jobs. He is not. If you were willing to vote for Trudeau, who has nursed at the government teat his whole life, you cannot make this argument against voting for Poilievre.  And while government experience isn't ideal for a conservative, he's had a lot of cabinet positions.\n\n3. \"He's an extremist/He's a Nayzi!\"\n\nHe is not. The core of his campaign is getting rid of a tax. It's about as milquetoast of a conservative goal as you can get. \n\n4. \"He's gonna ban abortion!\"\n\nAbortion is pretty much Canada's second most sacred cow after healthcare. We made Mortengaler a member of the OOC. As sourced from ChatGPT, he won't personally touch abortion. I do concede that if he gets over 250 seats the Conservatives may have a free vote on some issue like banning late-term abortion and that may pass. That's as far as it's going to get. You're going to be able to kill as many babies for as long as you want.\n\n5. \"He's working for the oligarchs!\"\n\nThis is the best liberal point, and would be a good point if it weren't that the Liberals are also the oligarch party in Canada. In fact more so. Canada is basically a state of Oligarchs. Air Canada, the banks, the housing giants, the telecoms, the Irvings, the Westons; in Canada, these  groups and peopleare untouchable. I do think Poilievre will be better for the economy because he'll be better at reducing housing costs and forcing municipalities to build, and will probably reduce immigration at least somewhat, putting less strain on housing, but luckily  for him, he's running against an NDP which is regarded and the Liberals, who are the oligarchs. So this one's a wash. \n\nAnyways, even I am not super excited about him, but I'm not impressed because I think he isn't conservative enough, not because he is too conservative. I do think he's smarter and more competent than Trudeau, and I'm cautiously optimistic about him. Please discuss. "}

This includes hot water washes or high-heat drying, which clearly use more energy compared to cold water washes or tumble drying with no heat.\n\nFrom an efficiency and fairness standpoint, I believe the cost should be adjusted based on the settings:\n\n- Cold water washes use significantly less energy than hot or warm cycles since they don’t require water heating.\n\n- Tumble drying (no heat) saves energy compared to regular drying cycles, which rely on high heat to remove moisture. Example : Assuming 4kWh for full heat, and 500Wh for tumble dry, assuming 38¢ per kWh, heated dry is at least at least $1 more per hour (cycle) than tumble dry. \n\n\nIt seems unfair that those who opt for eco-friendly, lower-energy settings still have to pay the same price as someone using high heat for both washing and drying. Adjusting pricing based on energy usage would incentivize energy-saving choices and reduce waste.\n\n\nThe counterargument might be that implementing variable pricing systems would be costly or complicated, but I’d argue the technology to account for different settings is already feasible, given that machines can detect and display these options.\n\nChange My View: Why shouldn’t coin-operated washers and dryers adopt variable pricing to reflect energy usage?

This post is not about them (\"virtually all\", not \"all\"), and I sympathize to those situations.\n\nHowever, for the majority of couples who accidentally got pregnant, it simply comes down to a lack of education and knowing what to do. If this applies to you or a loved one, please know that I am not intending to invalidate your experience, shame you, or make any comment on your intelligence. The system has been designed to fail, and you were a victim.\n\nAt the risk of leaning on anecdotal evidence, the amount of sexual education knowledge I've learned online in my adulthood, mostly by happenstance, has been staggering. I asked around my peers and many of them didn't know what [contraceptive failure rates actually represent](https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-do-you-interpret-birth-control-failure-rates-906657), or that [if you put a condom on wrong, you're supposed to throw it away](https://www.brook.org.uk/your-life/condoms-common-mistakes/), or that [Plan B has several exceptions that reduce its effectiveness](https://yalehealth.yale.edu/topic/emergency-contraception-morning-after-pill).

And if I can be the first one to tell you this: [porn isn't like real life](https://panthernow.com/2018/02/14/pornography-constructs-false-reality-sex).\n\nI didn't know some of these things. Not because I'm some foolish dummy, but because **I didn't know what I didn't know**, and no one ever taught me.\n\nOnly [30 of the 50 states require sex education](https://siecus.org/siecus-state-profiles/) to be taught in schools.

Going back to the numbers from above, it is impossible to say that all these couples did everything they could do to prevent the pregnancy. Again, this isn't because they didn't try their hardest, but because they didn't know what could be done.\n\nMore and more states are interested in banning abortions. In a crazy coincidence, [the states that are restricting or banning abortion are the same states that don't have good sex ed programs](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/graphic-many-states-that-restrict-or-ban-abortion-dont-teach-kids-about-sex-and-pregnancy/).\n\nI hope it doesn't need to be argued, that no one should prefer to use abortion as a form of contraceptive (and if you do prefer this, please go get some help). But [women who have abortions overwhelmingly stand by their decision to do so](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/01/416421/five-years-after-abortion-nearly-all-women-say-it-was-right-decision-study). This deeply personal decision can leave psychological wounds that never heal, and it can almost always be prevented with better sexual education earlier on.\n\nThere are those of you reading this who never would consider doubling up on contraceptives, and that's fine.

Think of a classic anti-hero revenge fantasy, the Hulk's \"I'm always angry\", the righteous anger of an activist or vigilante, etc.\n\nFemale anger is more stigmatized but still seen as a power that can be harnessed (often in a very specific \"out of control\" way like Jean Grey in X-men or Vanya/Viktor in Umbrella Academy).\n\nAs long as the object of the anger \"deserves\" it, we seem to have no problem with anger. Just look at the countless AITA posts where people act with extreme cruelty towards others and get supportive comments because their anger is \"justified\".\n\nBut in the real world anger no longer seems to have much utility. Research has shown that expressing anger (by venting or being physical) only makes it grow. I have never in my life done something out of anger that actually improved my circumstances in the long run. That's not true of any other emotion. Fear helps keep us safe, sadness helps evoke compassion in others, joy feels good and helps us act with compassion ourselves, and disgust keeps us from doing things that are unhealthy or socially unacceptable. Obviously you can be led to damaging behavior from these emotions as well, but their purpose is still very evident. But the only purposes of anger that I can think of are either A) protecting your life in an immediate physical altercation or  B) getting what you want by intimidating someone else. A is valid but rare in modern society. I think there are MUCH less harmful ways to achieve B. \n\nImagine a negotiation. If you are angrily negotiating, you're more likely to get what you want by screwing the other person over. If you're neutral or even joyful, you're more likely to be happy with a result that benefits both of you.\n\nI really do want my views changed because I have a problematic relationship with anger. I have intense fear when I see anyone express anger, even if it isn't aimed at me. I grew up with a lot of anger around me and have seen how damaging it is. I've never witnessed a situation where something was done in anger that wouldn't have been better executed without the anger.\n\nAnd to be clear, I'm not advocating for denying anger or \"repressing\" it (although coaching yourself through it aka \"suppression\" doesn't seem like the worst thing). I just really believe that as an emotion that drives behavior it is not often useful and much more often damaging. And our thoughts about a situation does inform our feelings about that situation, so I think it's disingenuous to argue that feeling anger is unavoidable or can't be worked on over time. \n\nEdit: I've loved most of the discussion on this post. There are a few ways in which my views have shifted. It seems as though there is a distinction between feeling anger, and feeling angry AT someone else. The latter feels harmful, but the former is simply a way of learning about your own values and motivating yourself to act. Someone also mentioned it as a warning system, which I found very interesting and I think especially if I frame it as a warning system to oneself, I can get on board. I continue to disagree that it's a *positive* force for getting your way or compelling others to act as you want them to. It might be effective, sure, but comes with the high risk of being abused.

For a comparison, people today view Trump as dangerous because of talk about jailing political opponents (which is certainly frightening to think about), but Lincoln went much further in that he actually arrested dissenters who weren’t otherwise accused of crimes and then took away their right to sue for their freedom (again even if they weren’t accused of a crime). You could literally sit in a jail for months without a trial under Lincoln without being accused of a crime, so long as you disagreed with him regarding the war or certain policies. To be clear, he was not just jailing people who said “I’m going to fight for the confederates,” but rather anyone considered to be expressing opinions aligned with the Confederacy. Maybe that sounds fine at first, but remember, there was no trial and there was no First Amendment protection at all - if you were suspected, you could sit in jail indefinitely.\n\nThen, after Chief Justice Taney held that this was unconstitutional in *Ex parte Merryman*, Lincoln ignored the ruling, permanently undermining the separation of powers for the sake of a massive human rights violation that he thought he was justified in committing. \n\nOf course, I don’t mean to label Lincoln as a terrible President and I appreciate his accomplishments, but I would make the argument that he should not be considered among the best, because if he had been President at any other time in history I think he would’ve been viewed as a tyrant much like John Adams was in his time (who also imprisoned political dissenters).\n\nYou could CMV by presenting other great Presidents (such as Washington or Jefferson) as having bigger flaws that actually make them worse than Lincoln, or at least make it a close contest.\n\nYou could possibly CMV by showing that the ends justified the means in this case, but I’d be highly skeptical of an argument saying it’s acceptable for a President to completely ignore the judiciary or to imprison people solely for speech that doesn’t directly incite or threaten lawless action. \n\nI would say my view would not be changed by comparing Lincoln to other wartime Presidents, such as FDR, Truman, or Wilson, as I regard all of these as pretty awful, like all in my bottom 10.

This person varies, but often it goes as far as someone's parents or close relatives (except children). Hilariously, one discussion I saw today was how retail workers shouldn't have to tell customers their names because they don't owe them that information. Lol. Today's wisdom is that we are disconnected, autonomous islands, with no responsibilities towards others if we don't voluntarily take them on.\n\nI believe this is wrong in a cosmological sense and is a society-destroying if actually enacted. You can't have a society in which there are no social obligations between people. We already have that substantiated in law, but outside of legal matters it's important as well. For example, you may be able to tell I'm going through online dating, and the ghosting we have in today's age is a point of consternation for me and for many. I think this is due to a breakdown in how we see social responsibility. If you really don't have any obligation to anyone, then ghosting is totally fine...but we all know literally nobody likes it. So, if you don't want to see someone, you probably have some level of obligation to say so, **Provided they gave you the initial respect that you should receive as a human by at least showing politeness and obeying whatever the social norms are for online dating.**\n\nBecause I don't want this to be about just online dating, there are posts on reddit, typically the relationship focused ones, about cutting people off, including parents, and people will cut off parents for basically no reason, and the comments are often like \"Yeah! F those guys! You don't owe your parents shit!\". Well, no. You don't owe your parents the world, you can't pay them back for your food and education as a child, and they can't ask for that in any reasonable world, but if you're going to cut your parents off, you'd better have a good reason. \n\nThe reason I say everyone is that, for a society to function, there has to be some guarantee of mutual respect, and I think that has to go beyond \"leaving people alone\". Yes, in most cases you should leave people to their business. But as a Christian, I can't see street people and think \"Eh, not my business\". We owe them something as a society, even if they are strangers. \n\nI propose this: For a society to function, **respect is something** ***owed by you*****, to others.** Yes, it is still conditional, but it is not earned.\n\nPlease discuss.

In any other job, even if it's dangerous, the worker is free to withdraw from the contract at any moment, which ensures that they can get away from a situation where they may no longer be comfortable. This does not happen with surrogate mothers, because a pregnancy can't be stopped that easily after some months, and that could lead to a situation where she's no longer comfortable but is forced to work, essentially meaning that she's in a form of slavery. \n\nI thought about jobs where people are forced to be in enclosed spaces for prolonged periods of time, for example astronauts, or miners, or people who work in cabins underwater. But they are free to stop working, even if they can't escape the situation immediately.\n\nEDIT: what I mean by slavery is a situation or practice in which people are coerced to work under conditions that are exploitative, or where they are forced to work\n\nEDIT 2: Exploitation isn't the same as slavery.

(I won’t go over every way they are, just a few examples). \n\n1. Men seem to not get the emotional connection they want from a straight relationship, as so many have experienced women not having empathy for them. \n\n2. Men can understand other men’s issues better than women can, due to being able to empathize, rather than just sympathize. They have experienced some of these issues, so it would be easier to understand and relate to their partners issues if their partner was also a man. \n\n3. (DISCLAIMER: THIS IS IN MY EXPERIENCE) Men seem to naturally give solutions/want solutions to a problem rather than just supporting the person or being supported. Whereas women will just support the person/or want support going through a problem. The solution to this is men being with other men, because this would allow them to get the solution to the problem without a woman in the relationship wanting only support, not a solution. They fit like puzzle pieces. \n\n4. Men seem to be happier with other men. I have seen many gay relationships and I have seen many straight relationships. The gay ones seem much happier, and in general I see men being more comfortable around other men; especially if traditional/toxic masculinity is expelled from the zeitgeist. \n\n\nIn conclusion, be gay, do gay things.

However, they've been consistently driven out of their fortified cities, with Avdivka and Torersk being some of the most notable instances of this. Ukrainian defense near Pokrovsk are currently struggling under the Russian offensive, and if Pokrovsk falls, Ukraine has no fortified position behind that for quite a distance, forcing them to either give up large chunks of land or defend open and unfortified ground.\n\nThe AFU is not in great shape either. Their premier units, like the 47th Mechanized, have been whittled down to a shell of their former selves as attrition takes a major toll on them. Their rank and file is not doing much better, as many of their units around Pokrovsk are at less than 40% strength according to Pravda UA: https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/articles/2024/09/17/7475408/#\n\nThe Russian military, meanwhile, has a formidable artillery advantage and has begun catching up to Ukraine in the quantity and quality of FPV drones they’ve been using. Incentivized by large cash bonuses and salaries, Russian volunteers are currently signing up in huge numbers, ensuring that addition does not decimate the Russian army. While the Russian economy is struggling, there is no indication that anybody in the Kremlin is considering ending the war due to the economy. Countries rarely end wars due to economic pressure in the first place. For example, both World Wars bankrupted the British Empire entirely, but they never surrendered until all of their objectives had been achieved. In fact, among Russia’s political elite, the main complaint has been that Putin has not mobilized the economy and populace more. If you remember the Wagner revolt, Prigozhins complaint was that Putin was not producing enough ammunition to fuel the war effort. \n\nSo based on what I’ve said above, I think Ukraine cannot reclaim their occupied territories, and I think their situation is likely to worsen. I also believe Russia is not going to simply give up and go home, as the Russian political elite are in lockstep around supporting the war. If you disagree, CMV!", "authorship": "human"}

Not just any solitary confinement though, It has to be a white room with padding all around so they don't hurt themselves, lights on 24/7, soundproof room, white clothing, white bland food and nothing inside. basically anything to completely deprive their senses. It is lenient because at the very least if you are falsely convicted, You have a chance to get out and it is suitable for a punishment for actual criminals as they get to feel the consequences for their actions without them actually getting physically hurt in the process.\n\n\"But the CIA does that to interrogate people!

Persecution of Jews in Germany was legal. Marital rape was legal in most places until the late 20th Century and still is in some places). Secondly, many of the situations that result in the retort \"their house their rules\" are describing illegal situations, such as abuse via social or emotional neglect, or coercive control (in British legislation since 2015). Thirdly, even in cases where it's not clearly against the law based on the limited information given, people who use this phrase don't make any effort to first ascertain if the situation is part of a wider pattern which is against the law. All of this indicates they aren't really bothered about the legality of the situation and are only bothered about compliance with the dictum of \"my house my rules\".\n\nBased on your own words (don't deny it, take responsibility for what comes from your own mouth), you also believe that children do not have a right to a home until they're in an economic situation to live alone. So in the interest of consistency, you should also never ask children or adults living with their parents/guardians what they do at home - you should now only ask them \"what do you do in your parent's home?\"\n\nYou also do not believe in conflict resolution or attempting to negotiate compromises, if your primary response is \"their house their rules, move out if you don't like it\" to people without basic personal freedoms. Which makes you generally poor at interpersonal relationships.\n\nFurthermore, if your parents were/are so lenient that their version of \"their house their rules\" (the rule you yourself believe as gospel) allowed you to do normal things like seeing friends/family, going outdoors, going shopping, choosing clothes, cooking, having your own phone and ID, using the internet, having ordinary hobbies, making noise on floorboards etc - you should also admit to yourself and to others that you're a privileged and spoilt individual who had a privileged and spoilt beginning to your life.

By 'culture', I'm including fashion, music/music styles, folklore/stories, art styles, festivals, and so on. By 'using' I mean anything from drawing inspiration, to immitating wholesale, to reusing with any number of alterations, and in both private and public contexts. So if one was able to avoid the three issues below (and knew with enough certainty that one would avoid the issues), I believe it would be perfectly OK to use someone else's culture.\n\nThese are three issues I see with using someone else's culture:\n\n1. Spreading harmful narratives, stereotypes, or images of a culture. Obviously, dressing up as an offensive caricature of a culture's members is problematic.\n2. Falsely representing a culture, and thereby spreading a false image of a culture. I can understand that spreading false information about a culture &amp; people (e.g. by altering a culture's folklore and passing it off as the original) is problematic (even if perhaps not immediately harmful). However, if people aren't going to take your use of the culture as a representation of a culture, or else if your representation is accurate, then this shouldn't be an issue.\n3. Taking their culture and claiming credit for it. Like with passing someone else's art or invention off as your own and reaping the rewards for it, I can see that there could be issues with taking something from someone else culture and claiming the credits and rewards for it without any acknowledgement. So for example, I see there could be issue with Elvis Presley and so on getting the credit for inventing rock and roll instead of the original black musicians.\n\nI am claiming that if these three issues are avoided, then there is no issue with using someone else's culture.\n\nTo be 100% clear, my position is that these are the only three issues with cultural appropriation. There is an interesting argument to be had about when and whether one can avoid these three issues &amp; thus when and whether cultural appropriation is OK, but it is not the topic of this post.\n\n  \nEdit: it has been correctly pointed out that I am using the word cultural appropriation wrong.

{"Article Number": 309, "title": "CMV: The pro-choice ethical framework, with its emphasis on bodily autonomy and healthcare access, directly contributes to the celebration of individuals like Luigi Mangione, and this is morally wrong.", "article": "I want to begin by saying unequivocally that I believe the actions of Luigi Mangione—who murdered UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson—are morally wrong. However, I also believe that the celebration of such violence reflects deeper cultural attitudes that prioritize bodily autonomy and healthcare access in ways that can justify or romanticize violent acts. I don’t want to focus on the specific case of the murder of Brian Thompson but instead how a broader ethical framework can lead to morally dangerous justifications of violence.\n\nThe pro-choice ethical framework rests on the principle of bodily autonomy—the idea that individuals should have the right to control their bodies, free from interference, and this often extends to the idea that people should have access to healthcare, including abortion. I believe abortion is the murder of an innocent life, but within the pro-choice movement, bodily autonomy and healthcare access are framed as essential rights. This framing elevates personal rights above the value of life itself, which I think can create a moral environment where extreme actions—like those committed by Mangione—are viewed as justified and even celebrated.\n\nLuigi Mangione’s violent act of murder, which targeted a healthcare CEO, was rooted in his belief that the healthcare system was denying people access to necessary care, something he saw as an infringement on their autonomy. While no one in the pro-choice movement openly advocates for murder, the same logic that justifies abortion—prioritizing bodily autonomy over the sanctity of life—can extend to the justification of other violent actions in the name of resistance against oppressive systems, including the healthcare system.\n\nI believe abortion is the deliberate taking of innocent life, and I do not think we can draw a clear moral distinction between the devaluation of life in the case of abortion and the devaluation of life in cases like Mangione’s. I also recognize that many people within the pro-choice movement do not condone violence, but the underlying ethical framework that elevates bodily autonomy to the highest moral good can inadvertently encourage a mindset where violent actions are justified in the name of defending these 'rights.'\n\nI recognize that this is a controversial view, but I believe it is an important one to discuss. Am I wrong to draw this connection between the pro-choice framework and the celebration of violence against those perceived as standing in the way of autonomy and healthcare access? Is the logic of bodily autonomy and resistance to oppression dangerously misapplied in cases like Mangione’s, or am I missing something here?", "authorship": "human"}

I hate how slow travel is labeled as a virtue. The idea of staying in one place for weeks at a time assumes you have the resources to do so. For those on tight budgets or with limited time off, slow travel just isn't worth it.\n\nI travel when I get bored of my day to day life, and I travel to see what I want to see. By the end of my trip, I want to feel exhausted and be able to ponder what the fuck just happened for weeks on end. Travelling is almost always more expensive than not travelling - so taking one's sweet time, sleeping in and \"soaking in the destination\" is extremely inefficient. When you travel, you're paying more to be alive - so you should diversify your expenses. I hate sleeping at the same hotel for 2 nights, because you're paying double for the same experience. I hate eating at the same restaurant twice (while travelling), because no matter how good the food may be, you're paying double for a similar experience. Therefore, spending too much time in the same place is also a waste of money. Plus, most places in the world are just not interesting enough to warrant more than 1-2 days of intensive sightseeing. I have been bored out by some of the world's most lauded big cities, such as Los Angeles and Beijing, but also by some smaller destinations that backpackers spend weeks in - like Lake Atitlan - simply because I spent too much time in them.\n\nPeople say that rush trips are forgettable and that slow trips are more \"meaningful\" and \"memorable.\" On the contrary, I've found that cramming the absolute maximum amount of destinations into my limited vacation days at the lowest price possible actually makes a short amount of time feel longer. I have planned trips under this philosophy for the past 3 years and instantly stopped feeling bored. I'm headed off to Chile, Argentina and Brazil this summer (winter in SA) and have planned 1 day in Santiago, 1 day in Valparaiso, 1 day in Montevideo, 1 day in Colonia del Sacramento, 2 days in Buenos Aires, 1 day in Posadas/San Ignacio, 1 day at the Iguazu Falls, 1 day in Brasilia, 1 day in Salvador de Bahia, 1 day in Fortaleza, 2 days in Rio and 1 day in Sao Paulo. The sheer pace of the trip might look overwhelming but I find so much thrill in flying from city to city and sleeping in overnight buses every other day - at the absolute lowest cost possible, abusing long layovers, multi-city flight ticketing, and dirt cheap buses/trains.\n\nDon't get me wrong - wasting daylight hours on long buses and trains is a colossal waste of efficiency.

{"Article Number": 577, "title": "Age isn't/shouldn't be a barrier in friendship, and why", "article": "Look, I might get cooked for this. But lemme just share my opinion/experience\n\nFirst of all: THIS IS ALL ABOUT FRIENDSHIP/CONNECTIONS. NOT ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS NOR FEELINGS. IF YOU CAN'T APPROACH A FRIENDSHIP OR CONNECTION WITHOUT ASSUMING SOMETHING ELSE, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU, AND I'M GENUINELY SORRY FOR YOU\n\nI'm 17. I've been in both situations. I've always had friends both older and younger than me. People my age have been consistently hard to befriend, because in my opinion most of seem too shallow. I'm going to break it down by categories, for simplicity's sake:\n\nFirst, people older than me. Since I was little, I've always been interested in stuff, mainly science, that was way beyond my age. All about atoms and cells at 5; space, geology and geometry at 7/8, etc. While my classmates were playing tag or whatever, I was chatting with the substitute teachers about random fun facts from stuff I'd learned. This is what you can POSSIBLY have in common with a kid. I felt way more comfortable/confident with them than I did with my classmates, which would never listen to me or take me seriously.\n\nAs I grew older, the age with which I felt confident around started diminishing, but eventually I had 3 or 4 close friends that were 3-6 years older than me. These friendships were incredibly important in my life. I had some really good people to look up to.\n\n\n\nMy grandma always tells me that teaching is the best way to learn. Nowhere is that more apparent than in spending time with younger people/kids. I get to be that boy they look up to, and I get to know myself better and be more comfortable with myself\n\nMy cousins are 14 and 11. They're the closest people to me after my immediate family. I know people will say \"WELL IT DOESN'T COUNT BECAUSE THEY'RE YOUR FAMILY. Ok, some of my friends from my immediate friend group are also 12/13, and I'm close with them. How is that weird?\n\nThe amount of assumptions and projections that arise from these kinds of stories are genuinely worrying. I'm not saying that the concept of maturity is relative, which is NOT, but that shouldn't dictate the stuff that you can/can't have in common as much as overall boundaries should, obviously set by both the younger and the older persons. They should also be taught more thoroughly by parents. Another example:\n\nIn a family camp I went to last year, I met a girl about 8 which started talking to me and stuff, and we kinda became \"friends\" for the remainder of the camp. What was I supposed to do, ignore her?\n\nJust be careful and you're good, for example, I refused to tickle her when she asked me, just because I didn't feel comfortable touching her, and it was not a good lesson for her. That's a boundary that a kid might not respect, but it's inalienable\n\nWhen they saw her with me, no one batted an eye. Hell, I was talking with her mother while holding her, and she even smiled.\n\nSo yeah, that should be the norm. Doesn't matter if they're older or younger, as long as it's a genuine connection without anything else, and you set proper boundaries, you're good to go.\n\nIf you don't see it like this, I'm genuinely curious as to why, so feel free to discuss\n\n:)"}

{"Article Number": 742, "title": "Reddit is a Liberal Echo Chamber", "article": "Reddit’s upvote/downvote system creates a self-reinforcing cycle that favors popular opinions, and since Reddit leans heavily liberal, it ends up becoming a liberal echo chamber. The way the system works—by summing upvotes and downvotes—means that the most \"agreeable\" comments rise to the top. If a comment doesn’t align with the predominant viewpoint, it gets buried, regardless of how well-reasoned or factual it might be.\n\nTo make things worse, Reddit’s infrastructure itself isn’t as decentralized or democratic as it seems. Did you know that **92 of the top 500 subreddits are controlled by just 4 people**? These mods wield an immense amount of power, essentially deciding what conversations can and can’t happen in massive communities like politics, worldnews, news. The implications are obvious: this concentrated control allows for a heavy bias in content moderation, often skewing towards liberal perspectives while censoring or suppressing dissenting views. It’s like a gatekeeping mechanism disguised as a free platform.\n\nNow let’s talk about how this plays out with non-liberal polarizing figures like Elon Musk. Love him or hate him, there’s no denying that Reddit has a knack for spinning anything related to him into a negative narrative. A perfect example is the controversy surrounding Starlink in Ukraine. When SpaceX provided **free** Starlink service to Ukraine, the agreement explicitly stated that it would be used for humanitarian purposes, like providing internet to hospitals and civilians, and not for military operations. However, when Ukrainian forces couldn’t use Starlink in a specific military zone for an offensive, Reddit threads were filled with accusations that Musk deliberately sabotaged Ukraine’s efforts by \"shutting down\" Starlink.\n\nThe truth? Musk didn’t “shut down” anything—SpaceX never agreed to enable Starlink in those zones in the first place. Despite this, Reddit narratives ignored these facts and painted him as someone undermining Ukraine’s war efforts. This kind of narrative framing conveniently skips over the massive humanitarian contribution Musk’s Starlink made in the region while focusing solely on a misleading spin. Redditors also speculated that Musk was Pro-Russia. It was later revealed Russia was trying to hack Ukraine's starlink systems but this was defended by SpaceX.\n\n**This isn’t about whether you support Musk or not—it’s about how the system amplifies certain viewpoints while demonizing others. When you combine the upvote/downvote mechanics with concentrated mod control, you get an echo chamber where alternative perspectives struggle to gain traction.**\n\nReddit isn’t the bastion of open discussion it pretends to be, and the sooner we acknowledge that, the better.\n\nPrediction: This post gets deleted or heavily downvoted.

So we make jokes, dismiss activists as annoying, or label them as extremists. It’s easier than **admitting we’re complicit.** That’s cowardice. **We are cowards.**\n\n**We look back at history and wonder, “How could people allow slavery? How could they let genocide happen?” The answer is always the same: People justified it. They told themselves it was normal.

The ads had hilarious pictures of overstuffed leather wallets (but not one that was reasonably utilized) and the general idea was you were old and out of touch if you had anything but a ridge. I ended up getting one and I have had it for a few years and I feel qualified to make this judgement. \n\nThis isn't like a lot of social media hyped products, it does work the way the company describes. It does block RF communication, I worked in an electronics testing lab for a while last year and we put the thing to the test. Other than that, the money clip works like you would expect, and the device itself has no problem holding credit cards and licenses. The longevity of the elastic will almost certainly not last as long as leather but it has held up fine in my testing. \n\nNow to the bad, it is annoying to get individual cards out. With a leather wallet that has traditional sleeves, removing the intended card was super easy, barely an inconvenience. With ridge, it is more annoying, in particular if the card is not at one end or the other. Leather wallets form to the space they are in, whether they are in your back pocket, front pocket, breast pocket, whatever. The ridge is a solid square. The ridge wallet damages credit cards on their corners. The ridge wallet also scratches whatever else it comes into contact with in your pocket or other carrying device. So you have your key fob for your car, wallet, and phone. Now my keys go in my back pocket, and I have to remove them to sit down. This was never an issue with a leather wallet. \n\nTLDR; The ridge wallet is true to its claims, even so, it is still inferior to a leather wallet in ways that are important to me.

In all these instances, I've 100% been the happiest being the \"adorer\". You get to feel the whole experience, feel all the feels. Maybe long-term things broke off, we were incompatible, they didnt choose me or whatever, but as the adorer I always got the most fulfillment ever from being with the one I want and making them happy. Giving all my love and care, despite them being blind to it or immature or unable to acknowledge it for whatever reason.\n\nWhat I say may sound stupid, but I've also been on the other side of the spectrum. Being fully loved and adored by someone I didn't quite care about. HATED it. It was absolutely horrendous. It felt fake, inauthentic, forced, tasteless.

By the end of my trip, I want to feel exhausted and be able to ponder what the fuck just happened for weeks on end. Travelling is almost always more expensive than not travelling - so taking one's sweet time, sleeping in and \"soaking in the destination\" is extremely inefficient. When you travel, you're paying more to be alive - so you should diversify your expenses. I hate sleeping at the same hotel for 2 nights, because you're paying double for the same experience. I hate eating at the same restaurant twice (while travelling), because no matter how good the food may be, you're paying double for a similar experience. Therefore, spending too much time in the same place is also a waste of money. Plus, most places in the world are just not interesting enough to warrant more than 1-2 days of intensive sightseeing.

", "article": "I love JP and I conclude that after listening to him on his podcast or youtube I do often have to stop, rewind, and listen to what he said again to understand what he means. He does use a lot of big words. But if you claim that he just makes nonsense statements and compare him to Deepak Chopra, you probably have a gap in your understanding of different belief systems. \n\nPeterson’s framework for understanding the world is rooted in a combination of evolutionary psychology, archetypal narratives, and a Christian moral outlook. People who approach these topics from a different framework—such as postmodernism, social constructivism, or purely empirical science—may find his arguments alien or difficult to grasp. Although he does dodge the question of God, he basically starts from the perspective that God exists, or at least that objective morality exists. I think a lot of the confusion about his statements starts from there. I was raised Christian (still am, but was raised that way too), but I think if you're not really familiar with the Christian worldview, or at least an Abrahamic one, which isn't materialist, that's a stumbling block for many to understanding what he's talking about. \n\nHis ideas often also leave room for interpretation, which can lead to misunderstandings. For example, his discussions on hierarchies, order vs. chaos, and the importance of traditional structures can be interpreted in vastly different ways, depending on your perspective. What I've found with people who find him hard to understand or hate him is that he takes the perspective that hierarchies are necessary, in the sense that they will always exist because they are a part of nature, as an attempted justification of the hierarchies exactly as they are now. Peterson's definitely a conservative, but most of his work is about how we can't get rid of hierarchies in general, not that hierarchies should never be altered. \n\nIt's also true that when he talks, even about a simple question, he often starts talking about things in multiple disciplines, linking psychology to sociology, biology, and literature too (guy loves Russian literature and the Bible). This makes his arguments complex, layered arguments that require listeners to follow long trains of thought. This can be difficult if you want a simple answer, which is frustrating for even me (like you talk about God all the time Jordan, how can you possibly tell people you don't know what they mean when they ask you if you believe in Him?), but it doesn't mean he's full of shit. It makes him a university professor (try reading Lacan if you want a hard read). He deals with questions at a very deep level. \n\nBasically, you can call him totally wrong and evil if you want, I don't care that much. He's not me. But it's not like he makes no sense. I think people who think he makes no sense just want a really quick, snarky answer, and that's not always the right way to be. Sometimes you need someone like him to really think deeply about something. \n\n"}

Well, I have a counter to that. It will improve society and it won't even collapse it.\n\nFirstly, legalizing murder would mean that everyone would have a reason not to antagonise one another. We all have issues with someone in life, ranging for a coworker to even our insurance company. With murder being legal, there will be an incentive for people in the society not to antagonize one another as they can be killed for any reason, resulting in a more peaceful society. This is a reason why it won't collapse society at all if murder was legalized.\n\nSecondly, it can drive up efficiency in services such as insurance companies and government related services. If people are allowed to go open season and kill government workers (including holders of political office) and company CEOs for any reason at all, they will have a reason not to slack off on approval of services or any other work they do as they don't want to be next in line. This helps improve efficency in services. Manpower issues? Well press gang those with remotely related skills to the qualifications of the jobs to take their place.\n\nBut what about a psychopath who would take advantage of the laws?

{"Article Number": 56, "title": "CMV: If there's anything sacred about the universe, whatever that is intervened in my life", "article": "I've been an atheist since 13 (now in my late-30s) and have a hard time believing there’s anything sacred or spiritual about the universe or our existence. However, my brain sure loves to generate some weird shit that makes me question my beliefs. I keep flip-flopping between maybe there is something more to my experiences and no, it’s absurd to think some sacred power is trying to contact me. But then I also think my experiences are kinda in line with those of mystics, shamans, prophets, monks, priests, nuns, saints, yadda yadda throughout the ages.\n\nThe wildest experience I had happened from taking duloxetine for nerve pain that started after chemo (2013) and kept getting worse after things like Lyme disease (2016) and SARS2 (2020). I maybe overloaded myself with norepinephrine since I also had a form of autonomic dysfunction at the time that made my sympathetic nervous system go haywire. Anyway, I spent about 20 minutes laughing and spontaneously orgasming from an incredibly pleasurable sensation around my left inner ear. My heart was beating so fast it felt like a vibrator. Queen’s “Don’t Stop Me Now” was blasting in my head, and I saw a kaleidoscopic multi-color tunnel of lights with “colorful ghosts” at the other end laughing with me. I could tell I was hallucinating, and it was very similar to ones I experienced after a head injury when I was a kid–those only happened in the dark, however. Then I felt something “pop” in the left side of my head followed by spasming in the left side of my neck and the sensation of fluid trickling down my head but under my skin. I had a huge head rush, my pupils were massively dilated, and my vision started darkening. I really thought I was about to die, but instead of fear and panic, I felt an overwhelming sense of love, joy, and peaceful acceptance of whatever was about to happen. Then a voice in my head said “The meaning of life is to live with joy for this world.” I felt my sense of self dissolve, felt how small I was in this grand universe I was nonetheless connected to, and realized the sheer magnitude of planet Earth with all its complex life. I got a sense of how much of a blip humans are on the geological timescale, and that we're not the main event on this planet. I don't know what the main event really is, but the vibe was that the Earth itself is a bigger and more enduring event than us that should be more venerated. And life will continue here even if we and many of the other species currently alive die out. Something new will take place and perhaps eventually stumble upon the weird carbon layer we leave behind. Overall a very transcendental experience which restored my will to live. It also somehow caused the nerve pain, cognitive dysfunction, dysautonomia, hypothyroidism, among other things I’d been experiencing go into remission. This happened in 2022, and I can work and exercise in ways that I haven’t been able to since before cancer in my mid-20s. I can clearly remember my childhood again, too! So the episode was a kind of miracle for me. I never thought I’d get better at all after almost a decade of progressively worsening symptoms.\n\nThe experience also reminded me of a sculpture I learned about in art history. It’s [Bernini’s Ecstasy of St. Teresa ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecstasy_of_Saint_Teresa#/media/File:Ecstasy_of_Saint_Teresa_September_2015-2a.jpg)with its controversial depiction of the saint in the throes of orgasmic bliss caused by an angel piercing her heart. Highly recommend reading about her since she had some wild visions during bouts of paralysis which influenced her writings on the personal relationship with God.\n\nThere was more that went on during that episode, but I cut it down to the essential bits since otherwise this’d be a lot longer. It also gave a different perspective to other life or death experiences where this voice appeared, including when I had the head injury as a kid, and was pretty integral in keeping me alive. There are definitely physiological explanations for what happened to me, but does that really rule out the sacred? For instance, ever since that 2022 episode my brain has been more prone to “chatter” much like this person with [posteromedial lobe epilepsy](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2100522118). So that points to a part of my brain that was maybe affected for whatever reason. But again, plenty of people believe things like that don't rule out sacred or divine influences. I’ve also tried reading about various religions and spiritual beliefs to see if something gave me that same “the meaning of life is to live with joy for this world” feeling, but I feel like so much of what people believe treats this planet like a prison which depresses me. I'm not sure where that message fits in with current religious and spiritual practices.\n\nSo basically CMV that I should start embracing what this voice told me as sacred intervention of some sort.", "authorship": "human"}

I recently found that this phenomenon is very hard to understand for me. I don't want to debate over the necessity of adopting inclusive language. I understand the need for native speakers to use gender-neutral language to promote equality. But it really brought me a lot of confusion.\n\nI learnt that the word \"man\" is for both male human and general human beings in my primary school. However, I now find that the genderless use seems outdated. The use of genderless man is inappropriate in modern English, so \"fireman,\" \"chairman,\" \"freshman,\" and \"unmanned\" all need to be changed to neutral words. But in this way, the \"man\" in \"woman\" is also genderless (it is from Middle English *mann*) and should also be replaced by some other words like \"female human,\" newly coined \"woperson,\" or the resurrected Middle English word \"wif\". It is inconsistent. (originally \"~~It seems like a paradox and makes no sense logically~~\" before OP editing it.)\n\nI have searched on the internet cannot find some theory to explain this phenomenon properly. If \"woman\" has been widely used and cannot be changed, words like \"fireman\", \"freshman\" were also widely used, why should changes be made? If the public has strong feelings for \"woman\", is it possible that firefighters also have feelings for the word \"fireman\", and college students will also miss their life in freshman year? Is this ignoring the emotions of these people?\n\nIs it a kind of compromise? Or just because the etymology origin of \"woman\" is less obvious than \"chairman\" for native speakers? If it retained the equivalent form \"wifeman\" of Middle English word \"wifmann\", would it be considered non-inclusive and get changed?\n\n\\--\n\nActually, the coexistence of male-specific \"man\" and \"woman\" that has \"man\" as a compound gives me a strong feeling of androcentrism and objectification. I am always very uncomfortable when using them, so I tend to use \"males\" and \"females\".\n\nI think it is the easiest solution to use the ungendered man, and a male word like resurrected \"weaponedman\" (or simplified \"wepman\", from Middle English wæpnedmann) or newly coined \"maleman\". In this way we could keep both \"woman\" and other words with the ungendered \"man\" as a compound, we just changed one word (the male word). Compared with the current solution in which almost all other words with genderless *man* are changed, it could minimize the impact.\n\n\\--\n\nNote: I am willing to change my view because I understand that I may have ignored some society and history knowledge of English countries due to lack of literatures (or just I did not find them).

", "article": "Let me break this down for you in plain terms. Hello, former 37F - US Army Psychological Operations Specialist here. When I say I know what propaganda is, it's because I literally made it. We just don't call it propaganda—only \"the enemy\" does that.\n\n\n\nNow, let's kill some myths.\n\n\nMyth One: \"They're all brainwashed.\"\n\n\n\nWrong. I can't brainwash anyone. No one can. I can’t make you think, believe, or act in a way that's against your core nature. You know why? Because propaganda doesn’t create new beliefs—it amplifies what's already there. People don’t magically adopt ideas; propaganda works by exploiting bi@ses, fears, or inclinations that already exist. It provides justification, not transformation. People won’t act contrary to their nature, and propaganda doesn’t overwrite that—it just directs it. That’s why it’s a convenient scapegoat for bad behavior: \"It wasn’t me, it was the propaganda!\" Or, as they used to say back in the day, \"The devil made me do it!\"\n\n\n\nMyth Two: \"I’m too smart to fall for it.\"\n\n\n\n((Laughs in psy-op)). Oh, sweetheart, no. Your arrogance makes you an easy target. All I have to do is stroke that ego of yours. Flatter you. Tell you you’re special, enlightened, smarter than \"those other idiots.\" I’ll tell you you’re on the right side of history, and they’re the bad guys. Sound familiar? You’ll eat it up because it feeds your ego, and before you know it, you’re parroting the same points I designed for you.\n\n\n\nMyth Three: \"Only those people fall for propaganda.\"\n\n\n\nNope. Everyone is susceptible to it. You, me, everyone. Why? Because propaganda is just targeted marketing. It’s tailor-made to appeal to your wants, needs, fears, and desires. You think you’re immune because you’re logical, but I’m not going after your logic—I’m going for your emotions. Because if I can get you to feel, you’ll forget to think. That’s the whole game.\n\n\nFast food ads? That’s propaganda. They don’t sell burgers; they sell happiness and family moments. ASPCA commercials? Same deal—they trigger guilt and compassion. It’s all about emotional manipulation. Even neon signs are propaganda in a way—they’re designed to catch your eye. It’s everywhere, and it works because it’s made for you.\n\n\n\nThe Truth About Propaganda:\n\n\n\nI’m not trying to convert everyone. That’s not how it works. I’m not going to turn a vegetarian into a steak lover with my steakhouse ad. But that’s fine—I’m not talking to vegetarians. I’m targeting the people who already love steak. I’m showing them sizzling steaks, happy diners, and good times. I’m tapping into their existing desires. I’ve already accounted for the people I won’t reach. What matters is getting enough of the right people to bite, and I will.\n\n\nSo no, propaganda isn’t some all-powerful force that magically rewires brains. It’s just psychology, marketing, and knowing how to push the buttons you already have. Everyone is vulnerable to it—especially those who think they aren’t.", "authorship": "human"}

But I have never understood why, and the reasons given to me seem weak. In some instances, the primary reading does seem required(like in scholarship) but most people, like me, have a more practical use for philosophy. We want to understand reality and figure out our own personal philosophies as to how relate to reality. \n\nIn that sense, it is important to know what Aristotle's ideas where not because of Aristotle, but because of the merits of the ideas. And Aristotle needs not be the best exponent of the merit of Aristotle's ideas. And there are some issues in reading the primary sources: other languages, historical context missing, biographical context missing, specific linguistic context missing, bad writing and so on. There are thousands of possible thinkers one could read, and one already trusts in a communal effort to simplify ideas to give a take of the most common, more influential and important thinkers. We don't have to waft through upon thousands and thousands of papers to say \"nah, I'm not a materialist\" or \"this unknown thinker Raphael Schburtz\\[random name\\] is too bad of a writer or uninteresting\". In that sense, even university programs try to get a bang for one's buck, and even primary sources are selected passages from primary sources.\n\nSo, given the common-sense approach of using communal effort to simplify my task, why wouldn't I continue that and simplify further and focus on great secondary sources MEANT to enlighten upon a thinker? I'm talking of things like lectures, the SEP, IEP, Oxford Handbook, Cambridge Companion. Things that are meant to be most comprehensive, up-to-date, and scholarly expositions of a topic/thinker? It seems odd, for me, to have someone say that one could not known what Locke was about from reading one of such sources. If one doesn't, it's not an issue in the method but in the source. If I read Oxford Handbook and Cambridge Companion on Spinoza and I don't get out having a sufficient, comprehensive, scholarly understanding from Spinoza then something has gone implausible and awfully wrong in their editorial process.\n\nWhy would I think I could understand Hegel better than, say, the dozen experts who contribute to such extensions? I would not just have to learn German, I would have to learn the specific usages of Hegel's time, and then waft through Hegel's biography and historical setting to get an idea of what he was doing. I will probably miss a lot of key terms and entirely butcher his system in a blatant misreading. Surely I can benefit from the decades or centuries of expertise of scholars instead.\n\nSome of the common arguments against my view:  \n \\- That reading through the thinkers themselves train our philosophical mind. Which is, of course, true, to an extent. But dialogue, thinking, summarizing, writing ALSO train the philosophical mind in a more direct and useful way. Remember, the interest is practical. I also have to struggle to read secondary sources and grasp them, they will just have a higher chance of being more concise, relevant, comprehensive, can extend beyond the limits of the thinker and with up to date edition.  \n\\- That one needs to understand the arguments. But this is something a proper exposition ought to cover as well. It's not mere ideas, it's the connection of ideas in a lot of ways, including separating properly the arguments for clarity.  \n\\- That one gets an irreplaceable \"something\" in the experience. Examples given is that when doing science, one can read science or DO science, and that there's something crucially important in doing the actual practical science. But this I think goes to my point, the practical philosophy goes beyond the reading. That's why wiser readings provide my practical mind with more elements of discernment, inquiry and overall materials to work with. But even if something unique is learnt, that needs not translate to a wiser reading. For example, I'm sure that if I want to know whether evolution is true, I will gain a unique, irreplaceable insight if I do a lot of experiments from myself, or if I go directly to Palestine and intervene a lot of people, or even if I learn Ancient Greek and read Aristotle myself, or inquire into Kant's biography myself wafting through documents and documents, letters and so on. But why is it unwise and necesary to gain practical knowledge for a practical systematization as opposed to the common sense and practice of going to the experts?\n\nI know my view is controversial(and sorry for the length but thought it important) but I really want to know what I'm missing. To be clear, I'm not saying primary + secondary are not better than mere secondary. It seems so far to me a dogmatic concern but I've been unable to get serious engagement with my reasoning. If I want to get a practical understanding(out of which later on I could decide to go deeper) of German Idealism it seems reasonable to me as opposed to take 4 years of my time in reading multiple authors, and multiple books of the author, and reading them with multiple translations and multiple, multiple times, to read Oxford's Handbook, Cambridge's Companion, articles of SEP, and maybe 10 hours of lecture. That seems sufficient to get a proper and comprehensive idea, and maybe even better.", "authorship": "human"}

", "article": "Highschool teachers may be one of the most important jobs in our society. They're not only responsible for the learning and education of hundreds of adolescents per year, they're also babysitters who have an implicit goal of trying to mold how someone functions in society in a way that's beneficial. I don't think its an exaggeration to say that outside of your family, these high school teachers are the most influential adults in your life as an adolescent. They're the adults you spend the most time around in your teens, they're the ones who serve as the mentors in athletic/education pursuits, and often times they are the ones who serve as a guide on your first steps on finding out who you want to be.\n\nDespite this, many teachers are predatory weirdos and bottom of the barrel rejects. The ones who aren't are often overworked, overwhelmed, and underpaid to the point that I can only assume they're masochists for choosing the job. The job is not looked upon respectfully by society no matter what lip service is paid by celebrities and politicians. Schools are more concerned with getting a warm body to stand in a classroom than having someone qualified teach. The district overstuffs classrooms to the point of absurdity and shuffles around known bad apples to different areas because they don't have enough teachers. Why? Because being a teacher is a shit job and we as a society don't value it despite its importance.\n\nIt doesn't make sense to me that such an important job is filled with so many unqualified and dangerous hacks and the ones who are qualified are usually treated like shit. My proposed change would be to make high school teaching an actually prestigious job instead of it being seen as borderline bum job it is now. Maybe these steps could server as a start.\n\n1. Higher pay - Pretty self explanatory, teachers are paid like shit. They should be getting paid much more. In return it should be a job that requires a lot of qualification and impeccable behavior. Being a teacher should be something to aspire to because you are paid and treated well.\n2. Stricter Requirements - With more pay, more is required. Stricter background checks on teachers and stricter rules on their conduct. I've seen too many suspect teachers skirt around. We should've be having Joe Schmo be responsible for 100s of kids every year.\n3. Stricter monitoring - This applies to both students and teachers. The behaviors of both should be held to a higher standard than what we have today. Society should let students be punished or fail but on the other hand we should also be more aware of teacher misconduct so we don't let bad apples misbehave.\n\nThese would just be a start but a societal shift in the way we view teaching would massively benefit us in the long run. Unfortunately this would probably cost billions of dollars and we all know funds won't be moved towards education and even if funds were moved it would probably be embezzled by school district presidents.

As to business practice on how much you pay your employees, that is different between owners and philosophies.\n\nI believe in paying your workers their fair wage, taking care of their families and giving benefits where needed and where you can. However a fair wage is relative. I would go as far as to say that the majority of Americans have a spending problem, and that’s not to say we don’t hav economical issues like wages stagnant and everything else is inflated, but that for people with money problems, they will have money problems regardless of how much money you give them because they only spend their money on liabilities and not assets.\n\nThe only entitled people are workers who think that every business they work for, owes them everything. But these kind of people are the people I’d never hire because the entitlement can’t be fixed. Everything is someone else’s problem and never theirs, they only cause problems in their own world and in other people’s worlds. No amount of compensation would make them happy other than a 6 figure salary for little to no work at all.\n\nI agree, the world is going to shits, the rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer everywhere you look.

I will admit that despite the past decades' major downsides, they are viewed much more favorably based on various statements, regardless of the age group – from the amount of analysis I had conducted in my research, it is immensely rare to hear about how decades such as the 1980s and the 1990s are viewed negatively in the same vein as the 2020s; the disdain for the latter couldn't be more overstated as I had underwent personal struggles with anxiety and depression from recent current events. Even when I struggled from my mental disability in my childhood, I still viewed the past rather fondly. Granted, there is a theoretical chance that I could be just viewing the past with 'rose-tinted glasses', I find it to be practically impossible to imagine the 2020s to be viewed so fondly in retrospects given the overly negative reception with many past events in comparison.\n\nSo far, the 2020s decade has given people the pandemic and its after-effects within society, political unrest along with radical polarization, increased social isolation leading to depression and increased risks of suicide, the gradual erosion of democracy with cases such as Afghanistan and Myanmar, inflation along with massive corporate consolidation over housing, multiple genocides and wars, the countless mass shootings happening within the United States, skyrocketing cost of living, the increasing gap of wealth gap inequality, erosion of certain rights such as abortion, greenhouse gas emissions have increased global average temperatures, and that’s only to list a few. I understand that horrible events in the past have happened as well - it's just that so much bad has happened from this decade alone that it seems to make the events of the past pale in comparison.  I just find that the world, let alone this decade, is seemingly bleak and will not be looked back at admirably with the exception of the young adolescents and individuals that have been raised in a high class privileged lifestyle.\n\nIdeally, there is testimony from research groups backed up by data that society as a whole is supposedly better off than before from the decrease of extreme poverty, fewer people dying in conflicts in recent decades than in most of the 20th century, the ever-advancing medical treatments against fatal illnesses, increased life expectancy along with decreased child mortality rate; those aspects are taken for granted admittedly. However, the general vibe that I have felt recently is anything but positive – I noticed that people are generally depressed overall due to various factors that have been listed. I read that the same group of adults aged 18-35 in general will note that their time in certain past decades that they lived in at that time positively whereas another group of adults within the same age bracket will persistently state that the 2020s is a terrible time to be living in. Even from reading about older generations that have lived through certain rough times with the Great Depression, the World Wars, the looming threat of the Cold War, segregation, apartheid, communism with Eastern Europe, the Vietnam War, the AIDS epidemic that those periods of time, they would state that this time of era is even worse than they they lived through which really puts the 2020s in such a negative light.\n\nTo put it in layman's terms, I am filled with confidence that the 2020s is generally despised now and that it will never be - this decade's overall vibe and reception will be no different than the 1930s.

In the first two, the main antagonists both had good reasons for why they were doing what they were, and represented a bigger issue in the world.

While it doesn't seem pejorative on it's face, the underlying implications is deliberately anti-Jewish.  The early church was very deliberately anti-Jewish and spoke of Jews being backwards and that their new revelation is the superior one.\n\nThis is still a narrative that is pushed today, that the Hebrew Testament is all violence and vengeance, and the Christian one is all mercy and forgiveness.  And that is not an accurate depiction of either testament.  There is plenty of mercy and forgiveness in the Hebrew Testament, and plenty of advocacy of violence and justification of violence in the Christian one.  I'm not trying to say they are the same, or the Hebrew testament isn't full of violence both active and proscribed as law.  Just that it isn't so cut and dry, and it has been a slander that has used as an excuse to be violent against Jews and attributed false violence and bloodlust to Jews [(the Blood libel) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel)as one big example of this\n\nAnd I'm not here to contest the antisemitism of the early (and modern) church.  Just to explain why the names were chosen as they were.\n\nMuslims refer to it not as the old and new testaments, but as the Tawrah (from the word Torah - what Jews call the 5 books of Moses) and Injil, which means gospel (as in the gospels of Jesus).  Even though they believe that the Quran supersedes the previous holy books, they are still canon and there is no pejorative connotation for either of them.\n\nThe only possible reason to continue to call it the Old Testament, is because the Christian Old Testament is different than the Tanakh (which is what Jews call it).  There are some books in a different order, and there are differences in a Christian translation than a Jewish one (there are different ten commandments according the the Tanakh and the Old Testament).   But that's why I think it should be referred to as the Hebrew Testament instead of the Tanakh or the Jewish Testament.  Because the Old Testament has unconscious negative connotations that upholds a Christian supremacy world view, and subtly pushes an anti-Jewish narrative.  Hebrew Testament and Christian Testament do not carry those same implications and it is still a separate thing than the Tanakh.\n\n  \n\\*Edit: I don't care about downvotes or my Karma score or whatever, but I'm wondering why nearly all my responses in this thread are getting downvoted?

{"Article Number": 199, "title": "CMV:  Not All Jobs Should Pay a Living Wage", "article": "Change My View: \n\nI don't begrudge people making a living wage, but I feel that some jobs are 'starter' jobs. IMO most customer facing retail jobs such as fast food servers and grocery stockers are jobs for people still in high school, or just out of high school. Jobs for teenagers where you are learning the ropes of working.\n\nI've done these jobs, and understand that they can be very hard work, but they don't usually take a ton of skill, experience or education. And (in theory) if you get good at these jobs, and gain experience in them, you move up to better paying jobs that require more experience, like assistant manager, manager, etc.\n\nYears ago I owned a small, independent retail store, and I watched minimum wage go from $6-$14. I wanted to be a good boss, so I started out paying over minimum wage by around a buck. I also made sure there were drinks and snacks for the staff to have (for free). I also didn't mind if, when the store was slow and tasks were finished, if the staff wanted to sit down and study for finals or do a crossword or whatever. (not at all trying to make out like I was some hero here or anything. Just wanted a chill, happy working environment for myself and everyone else.)\n\nThen minimum wage went up. And up. And up.\n\nI didn't have to fire anyone due to wages, but I def held off on hiring when we did have people leave. By the end, I had about half the staff that I did at the beginning.\n\n$1/ hour is $2080 per year in wages, assuming a 40 hour work week. Add to that what employers have to pay CPP $124, vacation pay $83.20and employer EI contributions of 47.46., so $1 raise in minimum wage means the employer pays out $2334.66 per year per person making that extra $1. (I'm in Canada. These numbers may have changed a bit from when I was doing this 10+ years ago.)\n\nIf you have multiple employees, that is a big leap in cost. And as a retailer, you can't just up your prices to adjust. Little stores still have to stay competitive with the Walmarts, pay rent, heat, electric, buy stock, insurance, taxes, etc etc.\n\nMost of our employees were teenagers or early twenties. Some were really great employees, and some ... were not. Not fireable offences, but some employees needed to be watched more carefully so they wouldn't be lazy/make mistakes. I would have much rather paid the better people better, and the less good people less, but at the end, I couldn't afford to start people above min wage and everyone made the same, even though there was often a clear difference in skill and work ethic.\n\nTLDR: Less skilled jobs should not be 'forever' jobs. Just starter ones.\n\nBTW: I am ALL for having caps on what CEOs make. No one should be a Billionaire and no one should make 1000x what their lowest paid employee makes.", "authorship": "human"}

Canadians have this inferiority complex that is despicable to me. Actively finding flaws in their southern neighbors, but turning a blind eye to their own. All rooted in resentment and jealousy because not only does the USA have a larger economy, but is successful in growing it and producing successful contributions to the world. Like the arts industry, tech, aviation, finances...even successful Canadian actors and singers wind up living in California. The Canadian economy has been stagnating at around 2 trillion. 4 years ago, the US economy was at 21 trillion. Now, it's 27 and growing fast. Plus, salaries are higher in some industries and cost of living is lower in most parts of the US excluding the top famous cities. In addition, Canadians who would like to avoid the cold such as the snowbirds, they now would have unlimited time to stay in Florida without restrictions set by immigration law.\n\nThe only downsides are healthcare and safety. But healthcare is context-dependent and a lot of Canadians assume Americans pay out of pocket which is pretty ignorant, but they'll eventually figure it out. Most people have insurance for themselves so we should learn the concept of self reliance instead of demanding freebies. Healthcare should be free only for those who can't take care of themselves due to extraordinary circumstances such being mentally disabled. But for the majority, they just have to treat it like dental insurance. It's not a significant impact really plus you get perks of privatized healthcare including short wait times and access to experimental futuristic treatments if you really want to pay for it. The current system of banning health insurance is ridiculous. Healthcare in the US functionally has the right idea. It's just the costs, but that can be solved. Finally for guns, that's controversial because a proportion of Canadians were not happy with Trudeau's actions of banning guns from law-abiding citizens in response to criminals who obtained their guns illegally. As for shootings and crime, they're mostly done by poor people. It's highly unlikely they have the finances to move up north and stir trouble if the border is removed. For mass shootings, besides Detroit and Buffalo, the other American cities that are considered dangerous are pretty far away. Who's gonna drive hours up north just to shoot at Canadians?\n\nIn the end, the benefits far outweigh the cons of incorporating Canada into the US.

And anytime Biden or Kamala or whoever does something it's almost always applauded and celebrated, almost never criticized or scrutinized.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong. I'm not a conservative, I'm not a MAGA fan or Trump supporter. I think Trump is a dangerous moron who's potentially gonna wreck the American economy with his tariffs. But I really think equally liberals in many ways are just as brainwashed as many conservatives. To many liberals these days politics is a team sport, as long as their team wins they're happy no matter what.\n\nAnd just as FoxNews is pretty efficient at brainwashing the MAGA crowd into believing all sorts of ridiculous stuff, equally the mainstream liberal news outlets have effectively brainwashed many liberals into viewing the Democratic Party as this great beacon of hope, a light in the darkness. Even though of course in reality the Democratic Party is pretty much just as corrupt and almost as morally bankrupt as the Republican Party.\n\nHillary Clinton for example has been a warmonger throughout her entire political career, someone who was strongly in support of endless stupid wars that led to countless of unneccessary deaths and human suffering. And she's also utterly corrupt and deep in the pockets of Wall Street. Yet when she ran in 2016 liberals just straight up ate up the propaganda that portrayed Hillary as an American hero and a champion of women rights, and the defender of the American working class.\n\nAnd Biden just as Hillary is just as much in bed with Wall Street and the corproate elites as most other politicians, and he's certainly no hero of the working class. He's voted for countless stupid wars throughout his career, and just the other day he promised to send another $8 billion worth of weapons to Israel so that even more civilians can be murdered. Sure, he promised to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, but it was clear that he never really intended to really put up a fight towards that end, because at the end of the day he answers to the ultra-wealthy and the corporate elites, not the American working class.\n\nSo liberals who truly believe that the Democratic Party is a progressive party that cares about the working class, and who view people like Biden or Hillary or Kamala as selfless heroes fighting for the people .... those people are brainwashed in my opinion."}

The right has been using a strategy called \"The 2 Santa Strategy\" that was developed and actually put into practice during Reagan's presidency (right around when the wealth gap began and continues to explode, funny that). The \"2 Santa Strategy,\" which you can fact check me if you would like, involves recklessly spending and instituting financial policies that will offer short term boosts to economic performance in exchange for massively inflating the debt and causing long term economic harm. Then when they are no longer in power, they relentlessly point out the economic damage and blame it on the left. \n\nThere's also the \"Starve the Beast,\" Strategy that goes hand in hand with the previously mentioned. This plan revolves around intentional sabotage of government programs or departments until they are completely ineffective, then once they have gutted it to a nonfunctional shadow of its intended purpose, they can cry about how poorly these things are handled and cut it's funding for their own gain, either through the privatization of these programs or just completely erasing them to make room for new tax cuts, which oddly always benefit the rich more than the poor. \n\nImmigration: Trump got up on stage one day and started completely making shit up about immigrants, saying counties were just emptying their prisons across our border, throwing a wave of rapists and killers at us, but that's complete bullshit you guys gobbled right up. Not only do immigrants perform crimes at a lower rate than natural born US citizens, but they are essential for the continued functioning of our economy. They not only provide massive amounts of labor that US citizens do not want to do, but they pay into things like Social Security and Medicare without ever pulling any benefits from those programs for themselves. And if you want to point out that they are undercutting the wages of US citizens, who's fault is that really? I know you are smart enough to figure out that they aren't in charge of their own wages, it's big companies that are more than happy to shaft their employees and pay poverty wages to these people seeking a better life.

{"Article Number": 174, "title": "Computer Science is the worst major you could choose.", "article": "Hey everyone, I just wanted to share an opinion on college majors and career paths. **Don’t major in Computer Science.** After you graduate with a computer science degree, it can be nearly impossible to get a job. This is because the field is oversaturated. Everyone and their grandparent is trying to get a job in computer science because of one thing: \"MONEY.\" . I majored in English, and I don’t regret it. I am in debt, but the reality is that I’m probably never going to pay it off in my lifetime. Who cares right? I went to college for the experience and to improve my writing skills.\n\nI believe an English major is better than a computer science major for three reasons:\n\n1. English teaches you communication skills and helps you become better at arguments.\n2. Language and Liberal Arts degrees are typically easier, less stressful, and less competitive than STEM degrees.\n3. Finally, the ROI (Return on Investment) isn’t very good these days.\n\nCommunication is very important, both on a casual and a professional level. You’d be surprised how many new grads in Gen Z have poor communication skills. If you read a job application, almost all of them require excellent verbal and written communication skills. These are skills that can be developed through public speaking and liberal arts classes. You might argue that English is a universal language, which is true, but you would be surprised by how many immigrants and people who come to the U.S. don’t speak English well. Developing strong communication skills can set you apart from other applicants.\n\nThere are current trends and studies suggesting that Gen Z is reading below grade level. Back in the 70s and 60s, 70% of children were reading books; now, that number has dwindled down to about 15%. This shift is due to kids spending too much time on electronics, and it will have a major impact on the workforce.\n\nI get it—difficulty is subjective. What I find difficult, you might not, and vice versa. There are many studies showing that many STEM degrees have a higher dropout rate compared to liberal arts majors. Also, grades in STEM fields are often curved, which means they depend on how the entire class does. Curving grades can create an unhealthy competitive environment, which isn’t ideal. I know that some non-STEM areas of study also have curved grades, but it’s much more common in STEM fields.\n\nROI is important when choosing a college major, and in my opinion, STEM degrees generally have a poor ROI. I know someone who happens to be my brother’s older cousin’s friend. He graduated from MIT with a computer science degree. He paid about $80K a year for his degree, had a few scholarships, but after graduating, he found himself $270K in debt. That’s not ideal. He will likely never pay it off unless he wins the lottery. The same can be true for most computer science degrees—even if you go to a state school, you could end up with over $80K in debt if you're not careful.\n\nJust a bonus reason for you folks: English and language arts majors have more job opportunities. You could become a teacher or a writer, which can earn a good amount of money. The chances of becoming the next J.K. Rowling are higher than you might think, if you consider the statistics and perform the calculations.

As to business practice on how much you pay your employees, that is different between owners and philosophies.\n\nI believe in paying your workers their fair wage, taking care of their families and giving benefits where needed and where you can. However a fair wage is relative. I would go as far as to say that the majority of Americans have a spending problem, and that’s not to say we don’t hav economical issues like wages stagnant and everything else is inflated, but that for people with money problems, they will have money problems regardless of how much money you give them because they only spend their money on liabilities and not assets.\n\nThe only entitled people are workers who think that every business they work for, owes them everything. But these kind of people are the people I’d never hire because the entitlement can’t be fixed. Everything is someone else’s problem and never theirs, they only cause problems in their own world and in other people’s worlds.

{"Article Number": 365, "title": "AI might soon kill us all and nobody cares", "article": "I believe we are quite close to achieving superintelligent AI. My longest likely timeline is something on the order of 10 years. My shortest likely timeline is as little as 2 years. In any case, it seems like we are not many conceptual insights away from an AI that can automate remote work at superhuman quality and speed. This would imply that it is close to automating AI research and development itself, which is very likely to kick off a process of self-improving AI systems that rapidly get themselves to levels of intelligence that can only be described as god-like to us. It should be obvious why that is threatening. \n\nI say this because the latest models are getting impressively good scores on tests of mathematics at the highest levels and performing some abstract reasoning tasks at near-human performance (OpenAI's o3 model with the FrontierMath and ARC-AGI tests). It was only one year ago when AI models would get nearly no questions right of the types that appear on these tests. As far as those of us who do not work in a frontier AI lab can tell, it took just one conceptual insight to get AI to this level, something called chain-of-thought, the details of which are outside the scope of this post. This single technique took AI models from being mere statistical token-predictors to doing something that resembles actual reasoning. \n\nThe bleeding-edge models of today are, of course, still limited. They require extraordinary amounts of energy, are not capable of carrying out longer-term tasks, and are inferior to humans at certain kinds of reasoning. But just as one insight took AI from near-zero reasoning ability to non-trivially greater-than-zero reasoning ability, it may not take many additional insights to fix these issues. Heck, we may already have all the insights we need and just need to scale up models. After all, the difference between our brains and those of chimpanzees is not that they fundamentally differ in the kind of processing they do. We just have way more neural synapses. \n\nThe problem with rushing ahead with AI capabilities to the extent that tech companies have been is that we have no idea how to make it value keeping us alive, happy, and free. If it does not value those things, then there is a very good chance of a bad outcome when it gets to superhuman capability. If it does not care about our existence, then what would stop it from killing us in the pursuit of the things that it actually does care about? For example, why would it not boil away the Earth's oceans to power the fusion reactors that provide the energy it uses? Do not get caught up on that specific scenario. It is just meant to illustrate the basic concept. Until this problem is solved, we should not attempt to improve AI capability beyond where they are now.\n\nIt greatly frustrates me that there is no political or social will to address this issue. The government seems perfectly content with letting tech companies continue their reckless AI development. It should instead ban them from continuing this research and work on an international treaty to enforce the ban abroad, but it does not seem interested in pursuing that. If we had any hope at all, much of it was lost with the election of Trump, as he is right in the pockets of the technologists who run these companies. As for the technologists themselves, they have deluded themselves into buying into various specific scenarios for how we can make it through this alive. But these beliefs are a result of rationalizing their preferred conclusion of achieving superhuman AI while avoiding AI catastrophe than any actual forward reasoning from the underlying principles governing intelligent systems. Furthermore, much of the electorate seems blissfully unaware of where AI is headed and therefore could not care less, instead choosing to focus on more transient issues. Oh well, what can you do?

I'm not saying the phenomenon itself is 'good' or 'bad'.\n\nStraight women are increasingly becoming bisexual in their behavior. Nowadays they have a huge willingness to try out same-sex stuff despite identifying as straight. To the point many women and men claim there are no straight women, only bisexual women in some minor or major degree (I know sexuality is a spectrum, but this doesn't mean that 'straight' or 'gay' people don't exist.)\n\n-Same-sex experiences (either just kisses or beyond) between straight women have become increasingly common. VERY common. Like, I think most of them do it at least once.\n\n-'Lesbian' is the favorite porn category watched by straight women.\n\n-Having a threesome with another woman is one of their top 3 fantasies despite being straight.\n\nMany try to explain all this with this idea that a woman's body is inherently beatiful no matter who sees it and therefire it also attracts women. I strongly disagree: we know women are hot because men are attracted to them, that's all. Why, then, do almost all straight women appreciate the female body as well? Why are they much more likely to identify as 'bi' than men are? Well, that brings us to the first cause for that:\n\nThe oversexualization of women in society: EVERYWHERE (magazines, TV, films, social apps) you see women being sexualized. Objectified as sex symbols for men to enjoy for decades now. Of course males are responsible for this.\n\nSo it's only logical that if a girl grows up seeing women as a sexual symbol everywhere, she will eventually develop some degree of same-sex attraction, to the point she may be willing enough to try same-sex stuff. While growing up, her brain has been literally brainwashed into thinking 'women = sexy' despite the fact she's straight.\n\nSame-sex stuff between women is even encouraged by men because it's extremely sexy to the 'male gaze' (for example, men almost always fantasize about 2 women being together).\n\nIf men were instead the sexualized ones, then the idea of the male body being 'inherently beatiful no matter who sees it' would take root.\n\nOn the other hand, there’s the fact that women are much less stigmatized than men regarding sexuality. Two women sharing a kiss? 'They are just friends' Two MEN sharing a kiss? 'Obviously they are gay. Or bi'\n\nGirl friends can hold hands, caress each other, kiss each other in the cheek, etc. and all seems perfectly normal. But men doing that stuff?

The way I see it is this. So many people have dietary restrictions for both religious and other reasons.\n\nFirst of all, as far as religious are concerned, so many kids have dietary restrictions here. For instance, Jews and Muslims are pescatarians except for Kosher or Halal food respectively. Or Hindus, who are often lacto vegetarians because that is their parents' faith. This is rightfully allowed because it's basic religious freedom to raise the kids under your faith. But also, it is basic freedom generally to raise kids under your values even if not religion based.\n\nAlso, there are other reasons for kids to eat a restricted diet. The biggest example I can think of is celiac. No bread, no pasta, usually no oatmeal, no crackers, no cookies, but somehow parents of kids with celiac are great and awesome but vegan parents are these demons? I don't think so. \n\nI kind of see veganism's morality as a middle ground. The case behind it is not strong enough where vegans have a right to claim that EVERYONE should be vegan but there are strong enough evidences that vegan diets can be healthy to the point I can be ok with people choosing it for themselves and their children.

The problem is, airlines are profit oriented and their customers are cost oriented. Many budget airlines or even long haul flights actively decide to fly through dangerous airspace rather than make a larger flight path around it to save fuel. If they take this longer route, they would spend more on fuel, flight times would be longer and ticket prices would. need to be higher to compensate. But with higher ticket prices customers would complain or not fly with the airline and unknowingly choose airlines which fly through the dangerous airspace as the price is cheaper.\n\nI am not absolving countries which shoot down planes of any blame, but airlines definitely know the risk of flying through it but still do so. Simple example would be walking through an old rusty bridge rather than taking a 10 minute detour on the newer safe bridge. \n\n\n\nTLDR: Flying through dangerous airspace is cheaper than flying around it so airlines decide to take the cheaper option. \n\nEdit 1: I think the view I want changed is that it is the fault of an airline if their plane gets shot down when flying over a danger zone when there are other paths that they can choose to fly to their destination. Airlines have a choice of their own flight path and although the chance might be very small, the fact that they had an alternative choice but didn’t do it puts them at some degree of fault. \n\nEdit 2: I think it is also an ethical question as the risk is definitely there and it is definitely avoidable.

The goal of tenants is to get a unit that meets their needs as cheaply as possible, and the goal of landlords is to rent out those units to suitable tenants for as much as possible. Having better information about what the market looks like helps landlords make better decisions about what to ask for, but it doesn't actually move those supply and demand curves around.

They will call it cruel or inhumane, but honestly, it is just hypocritical. Every country has its own culture and ideas about what animals are pets and what animals are food. Acting like one way is the only right way is not just ignorant, it is also kind of racist.\n\nIn Western culture, dogs and cats are treated like family. People spend ridiculous amounts of money on them, buying them special toys, fancy food, and even putting them in clothes. That is totally fine, but it does not mean that everyone else has to do the same. In countries like China or Vietnam, dogs and cats are often just seen as animals, the same way cows or chickens are in the West. They eat them because it is normal there, part of their culture, and often one of the more affordable food options.\n\nThe thing is, there is no logical difference between a dog and, say, a pig or a cow. Pigs, for example, are incredibly intelligent, and some scientists even say they are smarter than dogs. But people in the West are perfectly fine eating bacon or a pork chop without thinking twice. It is just cultural bias that makes one animal “acceptable” to eat and another one off-limits.\n\nWhat makes this even more frustrating is how little people in the West actually think about where their own food comes from. The conditions in factory farms are absolutely horrible. Chickens are crammed into tiny cages, cows live in filthy spaces, and pigs go through unimaginable suffering before they are killed. But because that is “normal” in the West, people just ignore it. Yet, they will get outraged when they see a dog meat market in another country. It is completely hypocritical.\n\nAnd let us not forget that Western countries did not always treat dogs the way they do now. Just a few hundred years ago, dogs were mostly seen as working animals. They guarded farms or helped with hunting. The whole idea of treating them as pets and spoiling them is actually pretty recent. So, acting like eating dogs is some kind of ancient moral crime makes no sense.\n\nThis outrage also has a strong undertone of cultural superiority. Western countries have a history of judging others for not living “the right way.” Seeing something unfamiliar, like eating dogs, and calling it barbaric without trying to understand it is just another example of that. It is like ignoring how eating beef in India, where cows are sacred, could seem just as offensive to people there.\n\nAt the end of the day, what people eat is part of their culture. What is normal in one place might seem strange somewhere else, but that does not make it wrong. If people really care about animal welfare, they should focus on fixing the terrible conditions in factory farms worldwide instead of shaming others for eating certain animals.\n\nSo maybe it is time to stop pretending that Western values are the only ones that matter.

Most period-piece games, movies, or shows use history as a backdrop to tell a compelling story, not as a lesson in authenticity. They’re rarely trying to be accurate, nor should they be. These stories use the *appearance* of history to create an immersive atmosphere, and that’s enough.\n\nFrom a creative perspective, studios likely don’t aim for accuracy. They want to connect with people emotionally, tell stories that resonate, and make something that feels \"cool.\" Expecting every detail to line up with historical fact seems like missing the point of entertainment. The priority is creating a narrative that engages, not adhering to a checklist of historical precision.\n\nWhat bothers me even more is how critiques of historical inaccuracy often feel politically motivated. For instance, right-wing groups, who frequently twist history to suit their agendas, are among the loudest voices decrying “inaccuracies.” The hypocrisy is astounding. Most media isn’t trying to rewrite history—it’s just creative people doing their best to entertain.\n\nSo, why not embrace this perspective? Why not let creators reinterpret the past however they see fit and judge the media on its emotional and artistic merits, rather than its adherence to historical trivia? It’s entertainment, not a history textbook.\n\nAnd, if we’re being honest, humans are weird about this stuff anyway. But hey, what do I know?

It included child tax credits that were wildly successful, I believe they cut the child poverty rate by half. However, these expired.\n\nVia The New York Times, reporting on the stimulus package at the time:\n\n*For a working single mother of a 3-year-old who earns the federal minimum wage — just under $16,000 a year — the bill would provide as much as $4,775 in direct benefits, Ms. Pancotti estimates. For a family of four with one working parent and one who remains unemployed because of child care constraints, the benefits could total $12,460.*\n\nIt was also refreshing to see after Trump's usually immodest boastings about his amazing soon to arrive infrastructure bill, that one was actually passed. Although the cost ($1 trillion) does seem excessive to me and it is irking that those who seemed to benefit most were large firms like CAT. \n\nNow the negatives:\n\nthe raw amount of spending is rather modest when put into perspective. Via Paul Krugman:\n\n*But when I see news reports describe these laws as “*[*massive*](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/12/house-to-vote-on-inflation-reduction-act-tax-and-climate-bill.html)*” or huge, I wonder whether the writers have done the math. The infrastructure law will add* [*roughly $500 billion*](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/infrastructure-plan-will-add-400-billion-deficit-cbo-finds) *in spending over the next decade. The Inflation Reduction Act will increase spending by roughly* [*an additional half trillion*](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/whats-inflation-reduction-act)*. A law to promote U.S.* [*semiconductor production*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-28/house-sends-52-billion-chip-bill-to-biden-for-his-signature?sref=qzusa8bC) *will add around $50 billion more. Overall, then, we’re talking about a bit more than $1 trillion in public investment over 10 years.*\n\n*To put this in perspective, the Congressional Budget Office expects* [*cumulative gross domestic product*](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2022-05/57950-Outlook.pdf#page=13) *to be more than $300 trillion over the next decade. So the Biden agenda will amount to around one-third of one percent of G.D.P. Massive it isn’t.*\n\nI am of the opinion that the CHIPS and Sciences Act was unnecessary or at least should have been amended as some Democratic senators suggested so that the chips companies receiving the subsidies didn't turn around and use the federal money on buybacks and dividends.\n\nSpeaking of stock buybacks, Biden's 1% tax on stock buybacks was welcome but in my opinion too modest to alter a practice that could potentially damage American competitiveness for the long term (as companies like IBM are spending more on buybacks than R&amp;D)\n\nI'm not sure what the ideal solution is to this (and obviously some of this is down to California's jurisdiction and its governor) but it doesn't seem to reflect well on Biden that in California the average home price is $700,000, which cannot be good for the average person. Recently, figures have also come out that US homelessness has risen to an all time high of 770,000. \n\nWage growth adjusted for inflation on paper has been impressive (7.3% for the bottom 10% since 2019) it is  important to note that often the cost of living increases for these individuals have probably been greater than the official inflation statistics (grocery prices make up only 8% of the CPI but the average person in the bottom 10% spends more than 8% of their budget on groceries).\n\nBiden cannot really be faulted for the nearly $400 billion in climate spending though in the IRA, good job there. \n\nBiden's student loan forgiveness plan (though this was not really his fault) ended up being hacked to pieces by the Supreme Court. \n\nRegulatory outlook:\n\nLina Khan's FTC came in with an ambitious plan to rewrite existing US antitrust practice. The results have been decidedly mixed. Lawsuits against Microsoft and Meta failed. A good symbol of where policy has become misguided under Biden is that the FTC sued to block the Tapestry-Capri Holdings merger over whether prices for affordable handbags would become too high.

However, I am disgusted at how modern atheism has become a toxic anti-religion echo chamber online by a large minority of radicalised vocal individuals.\n\nWikipedia defines religion as \"*range of social-cultural systems, including designated behaviors and practices, morals, beliefs, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that generally relate humanity to supernatural, transcendental, and spiritual elements—although there is no scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a religion*\".\n\nTherefore, I argue that pure atheism is a standardised, stringent set of systems, behaviours, and practices that purely originate from personal conviction and worldviews. It must not originate from reactionary opposition to religious belief, nor should it be defined by the hostility that some radicalised atheists express toward religious communities. Instead, atheism in its purest form should be understood as a philosophical stance on the lack of an existence of a higher power, reached through individual reflection, not groupthink or tribalism.\n\nAtheism should not become, paradoxically, a quasi-religion of anti-religion. When atheism adopts a rigid orthodoxy of hostility toward belief, it risks becoming the very thing it seeks to oppose: an ideological system rooted in dogma and intolerance. True atheism, I believe, should not concern itself with tearing down religious traditions but instead focus on affirming a worldview based on secular ethics and rational intellectual inquiry.\n\nMany online atheist communities, particularly on certain subreddits, focus excessively on mocking the worst aspects of religion without offering a thoughtful, purist atheist perspective. Instead of exploring secular ethics or existential meaning, they reduce atheism to reactionary ridicule, turning it into a shallow opposition rather than a meaningful worldview. Members of these communities often perpetuate a bleak life-outlook of helplessness, depression, and a void of meaning, when in truth, pure atheism can offer just as much purpose, fulfillment, and moral clarity as religion.\n\nIn short, atheism should be a personal conclusion, not a crusade.\n\nTLDR: Atheism should be a personal conclusion, not an anti-religion crusade.

Admit it 😊)  With solo sex, there’s no rush to climax, no guilt for fantasizing, no painful and uncomfortable contortions to perform at men’s ridiculous porn inspired requests, no mess to clean up or gross expectations, no spitting for lubrication, no worry about being compared to men’s brainwashed ideals of how a real woman’s body should look, no putting up with loud snoring as you lay there finishing what they couldn’t, no endless dirty talk and ego stroking, no listening to fake apologies for blowing it too soon. Yes, sex is overrated. Sex, just like anything else take practice. Most men don’t get enough practice, especially in todays digitally obsessed platform.  And those who do get lots of sex, are so clueless to what turns women on.  This is because most men learn from porn or locker room talk, and a woman can spot these types easily. You’re wasting your time trying to educate these egotistical mind fucks. Your best to shut up and scream hallelujah when it’s over, because they truly believe they are gods gift to women and if they can’t make a woman scream like they see on their screens, then be prepared for a major man-child meltdown. No thank you. At my age, I’m old enough to know, sex is way over rated. Sex with me myself and I is ALWAYS satisfying however, on a grand scale of mind blowing, earth shattering, volcanic full body bliss! And it gets grander with age! No ill equipped egotistical man child necessary. Or desired! EVER!!  Now that’s something to be joyous over..And highly underrated!!!!! Crone wisdom for the day, hope you enjoyed it.

{"Article Number": 330, "title": "CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists", "article": "A recent conversation with a Christian friend has me thinking about a common misunderstanding when it comes to belief, evidence, and the burden of proof. My friend told me that I can't claim \"God doesn't exist\" because I can't provide evidence to prove that God doesn't exist. This reasoning frustrated me because, in my view, it's not my job to prove that something doesn't exist—it’s the job of the person making the claim to provide evidence for their assertion.\n\nNow, I want to clarify: I'm not claiming that \"God does not exist.\" I'm simply rejecting the claim that God does exist because, in my experience, there hasn't been any compelling evidence provided. This is a subtle but important distinction, and it shifts the burden of proof.\n\nIn logical discourse and debate, the burden of proof always falls on the person making a claim. If someone asserts that something is true, they have the responsibility to demonstrate why it’s true. The other party, especially if they don’t believe the claim, is under no obligation to disprove it until evidence is presented that could support the original claim.\n\nThink of it like this: Suppose I tell you that there’s an invisible dragon living in my garage. The burden of proof is on *me* to demonstrate that this dragon exists—it's not your job to prove it doesn’t. You could remain skeptical and ask me for evidence, and if I fail to provide any, you would have every right to reject the claim. You might even say, \"I don't believe in the invisible dragon,\" and that would be a perfectly reasonable response.\n\nThe same applies to the existence of God. If someone says, “God exists,” the burden falls on them to provide evidence or reasons to justify that belief. If they fail to do so, it’s not unreasonable for others to withhold belief. The default position is in fact rejection afterall.\n\nIn the context of atheism, the majority of atheists don’t claim \"God does not exist\" in an assertive, absolute sense (although some do). Instead, atheism is often defined as the lack of belief in God or gods due to the absence of convincing evidence. This is a rejection of the assertion \"God exists,\" not a positive claim that \"God does not exist.\" In this way, atheism is not an assertion, but is rather a rejection, further removing the burden of proof from atheists. \"Life evolves via the process of natural selection\" or \"the Big Bang created the universe\" would be assertions that require further evidence, but rejecting the notion of God existing is not.\n\nIf someone says, \"There’s an invisible dragon in my garage,\" and I say, \"I don't believe in your invisible dragon,\" I'm not asserting that the dragon absolutely does not exist. I’m simply withholding belief until you can present compelling evidence. This is exactly how atheism works. I’m not claiming the nonexistence of God; I’m just rejecting the claim of His existence due to a lack of evidence.", "authorship": "human"}

This is unforgivably evil.\n\nBrief plot summary: earlier in the series, a being known as Infinity Ultron exterminated all life in his universe.  By a stroke of luck, he became aware of The Watcher, a being that observes the multiverse.  \n\nThis Infinity Ultron began crossing over into other realities and exterminated *all life* in multiple realities.  Captain Carter *knows this.*\n\nRecently in the series, The Watcher Uatu was arrested by his order’s leaders and presumably sentenced to execution.  I’m happy to grant the leader’s actions were unjust.  It’s important to note that Uatu’s execution is the only issue at stake here.  \n\nCaptain Carter considers Uatu to be a friend and wants to rescue him.  After several failed attempts to reach the order’s realm, she comes to the conclusion that only an Infinity Ultron can help.  \n\nShe goes to a reality in which an Infinity Ultron never discovered the multiverse and asks him to take her to the order’s realm.  \n\nNow, the Ultron she picks had exterminated all life in his reality, but has since had a change of heart and is now a “good guy.”  He helps, and the story has a happy ending.  \n\nThe problem is that she had absolutely no way of knowing this Ultron was now good.  If she had picked a reality with a still evil Ultron, then she would have been dooming multiple realities — perhaps an endless list of them — to extermination.  \n\nShe risked a *literally uncountable* number of deaths to save *one person,* and she did so with absolutely no information on the odds of success.  This was probably the most evil and selfish act in all of fiction; even Satan’s introduction of sin and death into the Christian world only affected *one* reality.  \n\nWhat won’t change my mind: hypotheticals about what happened off screen, like Carter somehow gaining knowledge about this Ultron being good.

My bullies in high school were a part of it (I mean it is the more popular genre but still), and it can be very misoginystic, promotes and encourages shit attitudes about others as a whole, instills or strengthens insecurities especially among men(and women for other reasons), promotes selfish tendencies and screwing people over for the sake of money (hustle culture and the like), and doesn't ever seem to promote understanding or encourage optimism as a whole among people around them.

And W is weird, so it doesn't get to change the rule.\n\nFor H and Q there are different spellings available for their pronunciation. Q has a whole bunch, some that start with Q, some with C, some with K. It's a mess. I think the ones that start with Q are best, but honestly we could cut Q out of the alphabet entirely and no-one would miss it so I don't care much.\n\nBut H is an important letter, it's all over the place. And it only has *two* spellings for it's pronunciation. \"Aitch\" and \"Haitch\".\n\nNow, I can't deny that \"Aitch\" is slightly older as a spelling - \"Haitch\" is a little over 200 years old, while \"Aitch\" is at least 450 years old.\n\nBut I think that the utility of spelling the letter as \"Haitch\" more than makes up for that slight difference in pedigree:  \n\n1) \"Haitch\" puts the core \"H\" sound in pride of place, rather than the secondary \"-ch\" sound.\n\n2) \"Haitch\" can be happily pronounced *exactly the same way you already are* because dropping your \"H\" in some words is a part of every english dialect. Meanwhile \"Aitch\" requires telling all the people who are pronouncing it as \"Haitch\" that they're pronouncing it wrong.\n\nSo yeah, I think that \"Haitch\" is by far the better of the two standard spellings.\n\nIt's also worth considering, however, a third option - we could revert the pronounciation to \"Hai\", the latin way of saying it, and change the spelling to match.\n\nI'm less keen on this option for two reasons:\n\n1) It requires telling everyone to change their pronunciation of the letter.\n\n2) \"Haitch\" includes the letter \"H\" in its two most common forms - pronounced or dropped (at speaker's preference) at the start, and combined with another consonant to modify that consonant's sound at the end.\n\n\nI'm interested in having my view changed because I know my position is non-standard, and at the moment it bugs me a tiny bit every time I come across a reference to \"Aitch\" - so if someone can convince me that \"Aitch\" is actually a better spelling then it'll stop bugging me.", "authorship": "human"}

For instance, Jews and Muslims are pescatarians except for Kosher or Halal food respectively. Or Hindus, who are often lacto vegetarians because that is their parents' faith.

The geography essentially destined this place to be the seat of power for our current industrial tech framework.\n\nThis presents 3 unsavory things to guard against:\n\n1. Our ideological framework might not be better, it might just be boosted by geographical - and therefore geopolitical luck. If your ideology misaligned with the US, it could be more that you suffered by simply being outside the global accepted trade network than that the ideology itself was bad.\n2. The US has the potential to leech other countries potential surplus by abusing the superpower status.\n3. And as follow-up to the above, the US has the potential to rot institutionally for a long time because it would take something overwhelming to shake out a change.\n\nNo country is perfect, but the US had an oddly benevolent past - with things like Breton Woods being a help everyone type of agreement. There's other nations that were way worse, like pre WWII Japan or Russia, but they thankfully never had massive geographic blessings. However it seems like in my lifetime I've seen this break down and now were destroying trade with tariffs, abusing the shit out of the reserve currency status fueling debt like none other completely destabilizing world finance, and creating unnecessary tension. In a sense, there's a real risk that US citizens could be perpetuating a global antagonist in a couple decades if we aren't cautious.\n\nSo, here's the CMV part - convince me otherwise, but it seems as a US citizen it seems like we should shut up about our ideology and stop forcing it everywhere cause it could be wrong. And we should entirely focus inwards towards boosting our native geographic luck instead of boosting our international presence.

Many low-skill, labo jobs have been replaced by skilled positions with better pay, helping the economic to grow and improve quality of life for both workers and consumers. Why should art be an exception? AI could push the boundaries and make artists to become a more profitable industry.\n\n\nMaking art more affordable \n\nTraditional art is expensive and time consuming, which limits its accessibility to the public or raises product prices. AI has the potential to lower those prices for commercial AI.\n\nThe fear of AI replacing jobs \n\nThe  idea that AI or automation will \"steal\" jobs isn’t new, people said the same about robots in factories. However, automation in manufacturing led to an economic revolution that allowed people to buy products that were extremely expensive before. If the  industry had resisted automation, we’d be living in a much less advanced economy today, we wouldn't be able to buy tvs, video game consoles or cellphones (Industries that gave tons of jobs to artist).\n\n\nAI is improving\n\nThe progress AI has made in just the last two years is quite impresive, and this is only the beginning, it will keep improving over time until it becomes a good tool for artits. Generative AI (like videos) can't replace a whole department, it will never be perfect and it will need human help as they do in the industry.\n\nMisconseption of AI\n\nAI isn't magic or copy-paste, AI is pure math and computer science. A neuronal network (most common machine learning models on generative AI) is a series of well designed linear transformations and activation functions that using brute force can 'learn' (which means they find a 'good enough' probability distribution) how to not make an error, what's an error? It depends, people define what an error is. \n\nAI can't do shit on its own, it's a math function that takes numbers and return numbers. However, if you add a ton of software developers, data engineers, data scientist and artist developers you can make people believe your service has human inteligence.\n\n\n\nJust to finish, I would like to add that before the generative AI boom, we did make use of AI in a lot of fields, including art already. Also, I'm not taking about the more human part of art, only the commercial part.\n\nBy the way, I have worked as a machine learning engineer before, currently working as a data engineer and I'm a mathematician. So you may think that I have a biase point of vue, and it's understable. Most of my classmates have high paying jobs related to data and machine learning (not necessarily generative AI).

{"Article Number": 53, "title": "CMV: God is definitely not real.", "article": "(Don't downvote this post just because it offends your beliefs. I am asking you to CHANGE my view)\n\nI was raised in a Christian household, but over time, I’ve come to question the concept of God, specifically as described in Christianity. After much reflection, I’ve concluded that the idea of an all-powerful, all-knowing, and benevolent God is riddled with contradictions and moral dilemmas that make it impossible for me to believe.\n\nLet’s start with omnipotence. The classic paradox—“Can an omnipotent being create a rock so heavy they can’t lift it?”—reveals a flaw in the very concept. If the answer is yes, they’re not omnipotent because they can’t lift the rock. If the answer is no, they’re not omnipotent because they can’t create the rock. The concept collapses under its own weight.\n\nNext, omnipotence and omniscience are incompatible. If God knows everything, including His own future actions, He cannot act differently, which limits His power. If He can act differently, then His knowledge of the future is incomplete. This makes the coexistence of these traits logically impossible.\n\nChristianity often justifies suffering and evil with the idea of free will, but this raises more questions than it answers. If God is omniscient, He created humanity knowing exactly who would sin, suffer, and ultimately end up in hell. Why would a loving God create individuals destined for eternal suffering? It suggests He created them with the purpose of being condemned. That doesn’t align with the concept of benevolence.\n\nThen there’s the problem of eternal consequences. Our brief time on Earth is insignificant when compared to eternity. Why would an all-just God base infinite rewards or punishments on such a fleeting moment? This feels deeply disproportionate and unjust.\n\nThe Bible itself adds to my doubts. It’s full of contradictions. Genesis has two conflicting creation accounts. Exodus 33:20 says no one can see God, but Jacob claims to see Him face-to-face in Genesis 32:30. Salvation is another inconsistency—Romans 3:28 says faith alone saves, while James 2:24 insists on faith and works. If this is the infallible word of God, why is it so contradictory?\n\nMorally, many biblical teachings are indefensible today. Deuteronomy 22:28-29 commands a woman to marry her rapist. 1 Corinthians 14:34-35 forbids women from speaking in church. Christians selectively ignore these teachings, undermining the Bible’s authority as a moral guide.\n\nFinally, Jesus is claimed to be the only way to heaven (John 14:6), but billions of people—such as those in North Korea—may never even hear of Him. How could they be judged on something they never had a chance to know?\n\nGiven these contradictions, logical flaws, and moral issues, I can’t believe in the Christian God.

So, I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case.\n\nAnywho, allow me to elaborate on my perspective:\n\nFor the sake of clarity, I'm going to use a common example: Religion. That's not implying that either of these terms are limited solely to that topic, it's simply to convey what I mean when I speak of them.\n\nHere we go...\n\nFaith, in the case of religion, is to place the responsibility/accountability of this chaotic and random reality upon an immaterial, omnipotent force...God.\n\n\"I must have faith in the fact that God only ever does what is best for me, so regardless of what may come, pushing through the process, and learning from the experience is, by definition meeting God's expectations of me.\"\n\nThis is how I view faith to the best of my ability.\n\nHope, on the other hand, doesn't require some outside force. It requires only yourself. I have hope in myself, to have the ability to push through an experience, therefore...surviving said experience reinforces my ability to trust in myself. And thus, I have no need to rely on outside forces, and only have need to rely on myself.\n\nI prefer hope for a few reasons:\n\n1. I don't like leaving things up in the air for someone else to grab and solve for me. I struggle with codependency on a grand scale, and feel that this understanding is better suited for my needs.\n\n2. I am impartial to the motive forces of the universe. I cannot prove if there is some intelligence behind it. Therefore, I should not waste energy on trying to do so.\n\n3. Even if there are motive forces for the universe, that does not mean it has to be a conscious force. It's something we experience a lot, and on the daily, that things just fucking *happen*, and all you can do is react. How you react is probably a separate conversation entirely, but hey, I'm open suggestion if someone can reasonably tie it into the discussion. \n\n4. I believe it is a dogma that the universe seeks to observe itself. It's blatantly clear that science has proven photons can change themselves based on whether they are \"observed\". This, in no way, implies that there is a conscious force, but rather there is simply a reaction to stimuli from another source: Us observing/measuring the focus.

The kid grows up when you’re in your twenties and have youth and energy to do things with your kids and create fun memories and when they become teenagers you’ll be entering 30s and can focus more on work while teenagers can be more independent. In turn you’ll be more likely to be healthy enough to spend time with youyour kids and grandkids in your forties. \n\nSomething like that but that’s how I think it’s also better from a parenting perspective.\n\nNow of course people are gonna say it’s too expensive and you need to focus on school in you’re twenties and while that’s true depending on where in the world you are, having a baby is not expensive but having kids and teenagers is. Therefore governments should make it much easier for people to have kids early. For example where I live all healthcare from conception until 18 years is free, you receive 12 months maternity leave and after that you can put your kid into a subsidised pre school from 1-5 year old, then schools are free until age 16, the city subsidises extra curriculars. The university here runs a daycare and parents get priority for student housing. We also receive about 3.600$ per year as child benefits per child. \n\nI think the only reason not to is that you may have not found the “right” person but that’s wishful thinking.\n\nCMV\n\nEdit: wow this got a lot of attention but so far no one changes my view that having kids earlier is better than late. But my view was changed because so many of you are cynical and actually think having kids is gonna put you in a wheelchair.

Cheap labor without means of defending oneself.\n3. **They are considered second or third-class citizens even though they can pass themselves off as natives.** One example of this is the dekasseguis, Brazilian-Japanese who, although they look Japanese, when they immigrate, are treated with the same disdain as other ethnic groups because, even though they look Japanese, their habits, way of speaking, and even their names are not Japanese. Their children are bullied for not being Japanese enough.\n4. **No one will recognize their importance to the country to which they emigrate.** Does any American recognize or show gratitude for the army of Latinos who work in the fields to provide them with fresh fruits and vegetables every day? Does any Brit acknowledge the importance of Polish truck drivers in delivering goods and services? Does any Frenchman extol how his country is a sports powerhouse thanks to Africans? No.\n5. **Immigrants are always one election away from being deported for any odd reason**. It doesn't matter if the government is the reincarnation of Hitler or the most egalitarian socialist paradise you can imagine, the rights of those who migrate can be taken away in the blink of an eye without any second thought. Several European countries are already considering (or have tried) to make applications wait in African countries before entering the countries; Xenophobic parties are on the rise all over the world calling for mass deportations, remigration and denaturalization of legalized citizens.\n6. **Immigrants are reminded daily that they do not belong there even if they obtain citizenship.** An ID card is just a piece of plastic. If you're going to spend Christmas with a white family and you're the only brown person who speaks with an accent, they don't care if you've lived in the country for 25 years. You're still not like them. They may not be as hostile as the KKK, but they will remember you for the little things.\n\nNote: My argument is for *voluntary permanent migration*. I am not talking about forced migration due to wars or requests for asylum. In these cases, there is a justifiable and rational reason, which is self-preservation. This is very different from wanting a bigger house or his children to live \"in a better place.\"\n\nThe stress that immigrants constantly suffer does not compensate for any benefits they would enjoy. Even if I were rich, I would never leave my country so that some idiot would spit in my face and say, \"Go back to your country.\" No country treats and respects its immigrants (and I include mine as well). It is better to seek improvements in your home country than to try your luck abroad.\n\nSo please, try any claim to change my view.", "authorship": "human"}

All it took was a few well placed posts encouraging people to flock to a highly monitored highly censored app directly controlled by the CCP and suddenly an unknown app in the United States rocketed to the number 1 app in the country. \n\nThis is an app that frequently removes content mentioning LGBTQ rights, anything they view as immodest, and any discussion critizing the CCP- a party actively engaging in Genocide against the Uyghurs.

{"Article Number": 5, "title": "CMV: American society is decaying ", "article": "My fundamental argument is that the social and creative fabric of America is or already has unraveled, causing social decay. A lot of us have picked up the elements of this decline in our daily lives. We are less social, more isolated, more detached from the pure ideological and alienated from our labor and its products. As well, dating culture, party culture, and whichever other social culture you can think of has become far less rewarding or outright grueling. This, I argue, is our society in the US decaying such that we are declining as a cohesive and functioning civilization. \n\nThere are numerous reasons for this but I want to focus on what I think is one of the principal catalysts and one of the prime nexuses: how America uses and understands space. Following WW2, the United States fully committed to suburbia and the automobile not just as a way of life but as the quintessential American life. The product of this conscious self-segregation was twofold, 10,000 years of how humans organize and socialize in their lived environments was completely upended and the overwhelming majority of American cities were razed to the ground and towns hollowed out. (If you want examples google almost any American city pre-war and then today, it’ll make you cry). This was so damaging because, as animals, humans are deeply social, creative, and laborious. We want and need robust social communities and we want and need to work our bodies and minds. The shift of American society towards the automobile and suburbia has made us immobile, isolated, anti-social, and detached from feeling a part of society. As this dynamic has grown worse and worse, it has facilitated our isolation, physically distancing us from other people, from commerce, and from community. \n\nThis dynamic of prioritizing single family detached homes (it’s illegal to build anything else in 70% of the country) and separating work, commerce, and culture (theaters, music venues, museums, etc) from the home such that one must drive to go to anything detaches us not merely from those aspects of life but conditions us to view them as distinctly separate from our home and community.   This is directly responsible, in part or in whole, for many problems we face today such as our housing crisis, political division, and wealth inequality as it facilitates the circumstances necessary for these issues to occur and worsen.

Hilariously, one discussion I saw today was how retail workers shouldn't have to tell customers their names because they don't owe them that information. Lol. Today's wisdom is that we are disconnected, autonomous islands, with no responsibilities towards others if we don't voluntarily take them on.\n\nI believe this is wrong in a cosmological sense and is a society-destroying if actually enacted. You can't have a society in which there are no social obligations between people. We already have that substantiated in law, but outside of legal matters it's important as well. For example, you may be able to tell I'm going through online dating, and the ghosting we have in today's age is a point of consternation for me and for many. I think this is due to a breakdown in how we see social responsibility. If you really don't have any obligation to anyone, then ghosting is totally fine...but we all know literally nobody likes it. So, if you don't want to see someone, you probably have some level of obligation to say so, **Provided they gave you the initial respect that you should receive as a human by at least showing politeness and obeying whatever the social norms are for online dating.**\n\nBecause I don't want this to be about just online dating, there are posts on reddit, typically the relationship focused ones, about cutting people off, including parents, and people will cut off parents for basically no reason, and the comments are often like \"Yeah! F those guys! You don't owe your parents shit!\". Well, no. You don't owe your parents the world, you can't pay them back for your food and education as a child, and they can't ask for that in any reasonable world, but if you're going to cut your parents off, you'd better have a good reason. \n\nThe reason I say everyone is that, for a society to function, there has to be some guarantee of mutual respect, and I think that has to go beyond \"leaving people alone\". Yes, in most cases you should leave people to their business. But as a Christian, I can't see street people and think \"Eh, not my business\". We owe them something as a society, even if they are strangers. \n\nI propose this: For a society to function, **respect is something** ***owed by you*****, to others.** Yes, it is still conditional, but it is not earned.\n\nPlease discuss.

Christmas won so much that you have people who aren't Christian like atheists or Jewish people celebrating and putting Christmas lights. Like you really think Christmas lost when the group of people who killed the person's birthday who you are celebrating are also getting festive, with their own lights and decorations? My Jewish neighbors had some lights up on their house, and my friend's Jewish neighbor had a ton of lights, they had a Christmas tree made out of blue lights on their front lawn. "}

{"Article Number": 97, "title": "CMV: Congresspeople should get paid more, not less", "article": "I know this is not a popular position but I really do believe it. Curious to see if someone can change my mind.\n\nI believe that Congresspeople should get paid a lot more than they already are.\n\n* As it stands, Congresspeople earn $174,000, a number that has remained the same since 2009. House members are now allowed to claim their D.C. residence against their expense accounts, so that is a big raise, but the reality is that there are *a lot of jobs* that pay significantly more than $174k now. \n* The reason we decided to pay Congress at all is because an unpaid full-time job can only be held by someone who *doesn't need the money*. There are three types of people who would reasonably fit that bill: 1) people who are independently wealthy, 2) people who are bought by outside interests, creating an obvious conflict of interest, and 3) people who are willing to sacrifice everything for a few years to serve their constituents. #3 is a great ideal but completely unrealistic, so we're left with #1 and #2, neither of which are all that great.\n* By paying a comparatively low number - $174k is MUCH less than first-year law associates make at white shoe firms - we invite the kind of graft that we wanted to eliminate by issuing salaries in the first place. We see it when career politicians wind up as multi-millionaires who nakedly trade on non-public information. One thing that has consistently had bipartisan support is Congress' continued ability to trade on inside information with impunity. \n* There is a common refrain, that Congresspeople should earn the same as the average American. I don't believe that at all, though. I want Congress to be composed of the best people in the WORLD at drafting, passing, and debating law; I specifically *don't* want the average American to represent me, so I shouldn't pay those people like average Americans! \n\nMy alternative is the following:\n\n1. Double Congressional salaries to $348,000, and index it to the CPI using the Social Security formula.\n2. Allow all reasonable expenses associated with travel and residence in D.C. during Congressional session, and *don't* take it out of the members' representational allowance (MRA) funds (this is because MRA funds include such things as office staffing, district mailings, etc., meaning that one could reasonably accuse members of taking from their staffs so that they can have a nice place in DC).\n3. Implement one of two restrictions on trading for the members and their immediate families:\n   1. Completely ban the trading of individual stocks for all members (ETFs and mutual funds can still be traded), AND/OR\n   2. Require a minimum 90-day waiting period between the initiation and the execution of any trade, and require public disclosure of all trades 30 days before the trade is executed. Once a trade is initiated, it cannot be halted unless the stock is no longer available or the portfolio lacks the available funds to execute the trade.\n4. No change in restrictions with respect to anything else, such as outside employment or fees / honoraria / royalties from books, speaking engagements, teaching, etc.\n\nI think this approach would encourage young, ambitious people (20s and 30s) to choose public service and end the blatant insider trading that has been happening for decades. A $348k salary is plenty to support a young family even in the highest-COL areas, but it still requires sacrifice for upper-echelon members of the private sector - law partners, many doctors, corporate executives, etc. all earn substantially more than this each year, but the \"pay cut\" still allows a very healthy living.", "authorship": "human"}
{"Article Number": 45, "title": "CMV: One cannot escape the consumer society", "article": "I have read 'The Consumer Society' by Baudrillard and I found this paragraph particularly revealing:\n\n&gt;The consumer sees themselves as someone who must enjoy life, as a venture dedicated to pleasure and satisfaction, with the obligation to be happy and in love, flattering/flattered, seductive/seduced, participatory, euphoric, and dynamic. This is the principle of maximizing existence through the multiplication of contacts and relationships, the intensive use of consumer objects, and the systematic exploitation of all potential gains.  \nThe consumer does not question whether he should escape this compulsion. This new individual spends less and less time on production within the framework of their work and increasingly focuses on the production and constant innovation of their needs and well-being. They must ensure that all their possibilities and consumptive capacities are continuously mobilized.  \n\"Try Jesus,\" says an American slogan. Everything must be tried: the consumer-driven individual is haunted by the fear of missing out on some kind of experience or pleasure. You never know if a particular contact, this or that experience (Christmas in the Canary Islands, eel with whiskey, the Prado Museum, LSD, Japanese-style lovemaking) might hold a \"sensation\" in store for you.  \nThis is no longer about desire, taste, or specific preferences, but about a generalized curiosity transformed into a diffuse restlessness: this is \"fun morality,\" or the imperative to have fun and thoroughly exploit all possibilities—the imperative to enjoy, reward oneself, and get in the mood.\n\nAs a minimalist, I've always consider myself 'above' the simple consumer. But now I'm unsure whether I am myself this very consumer Baudrillard describes. Even though I live a minimalist life in the sense of 'the things I own' I'm definitely guilty of  trying to maximize my pleasure and well-being through all kinds of media and experiences: films, TV series, books, news, games, sports, travel, etc.  \nOn the other hand, if you strip away all forms of consumption, you're left with a deeper existential question: what is even purpose of it all? Consumerism itself provides a ready-made answer: the purpose is the consumption itself.  \n\nEveryone is so deeply embedded in our consumer society, you cannot run away from it. Baudrillard would say that there is no 'outside' of the system. The consumer society is inescapable. You can only put up resistance through awareness.  \nYet this resistance is always half-hearted, hypocritical and full of contradictions: It is impossible to entirely escape the structures of the consumer society because they shape not only our external world but also our internal desires and sense of self.

{"Article Number": 383, "title": "CMV: Personality types do more harm than good. ", "article": "There's a pretty broad spectrum of ways people have latched on to in order to categorize personality type. On one extreme you have the completely fanciful like Harry Potter houses and astrology signs. On the other you have psychologically replicatable personality diagnosis like Adhd and autism. And in the middle you have these things that are in some ways reflective of who you are but lack any rigor like the Meyers Briggs and the enneagram. \n\nWhile I imagine most on reddit would sneer at astrology signs and HP houses, my belief is that all of these are harmful. I think that they are so in two ways: \n\n1. They limit people's ability to understand people at a deep level.\n2. They distract from genuine forms of community building. \n\nOn the first point: people are inherently varried, complex, and interesting. You can spend years relatively close with someone before you start to really understand them. One might imagine that personality archetypes as a sort of tool to establish some base level understanding. A scaffold to construct a more complicated model. But in my experience this is rarely how it functions in practice. People who care about these things will use whatever personality categorization they like and stop further interest in the person. \n\n\"Oh you like books? That must be because you're a ravenclaw /intj/ autistic.\"\n\nInstead of inquiring further as to why the person likes books (is it escapism? A desire to appear smart?) The categorization is thought terminating. They've solved the other person. I think this occurs because people perceive these categories as reflecting some fundamental nature, rather than as social constructs. \n\nEven the more rigorously replicable categorizations have been arbitrarily constructed. When someone is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder or antisocial personality disorder, we tend to view those as some true property discovered within the person, rather than as useful labels that might aid in treatment. If we were to restart society we might end up with 2 different labels that have elements of each. \n\nI think this is bad for understanding others. What charitably presents itself as a tool tends to, in actuality, limit peoples understanding of eachother. \n\nSecond point being that these labels distract from genuine community building. We humans evolved to be in close knit tribes. To exist in cooperative communities where we love and care for one another. However, we've established a monolithic social order where people are atomized and cut off from one another. Neoliberal capitalism is perhaps the most efficient system at creating material wealth, but it has come at the cost of elliminating community. \n\nPersonality archetypes act as an alluring easy way to get that in the modern world. \"Here's a useful label to identify and connect with people like you.\" This taps into the instinctual desire to be a part of a group. Instead of being in an actual tribe, you're part of the hufflepuff tribe. You wear the colors and learn the lingo of that tribe just like you would in prehistoric times. \n\nI don't believe this is fulfilling though. Identifying some label foesnt fulfill the actual human-to-human connections that we need. When someone is diagnosed with adhd and they start to filter their feed for adhd memes and posts, they might get some momentary sense of \"oh, its nice to know that other people have had similar experiences to me.\" They may even use the language \"I am part of the adhd community.\" \n\nBut this isn't what generates human happiness. The label isn't fulfilling in the same way that bonding with someone person-to-person is. If these personality archetypes were being used as an excuse to form genuine communities in the same way people use religious identity as an excuse to connect with others (and religious people are happier than non religious people for this reason!) Then they might be a valuable tool, but in my experience and perception this isn't what happens. \n\nThough maybe I just don't perceive these communities because I don't belong to any like that.

That might not necessarily mean maximizing the number of humans, but rather the total footprint of our particular tree of life.\n\nThere is a more scientific view that space exploration should leave what it finds undisturbed, only studying in a sterile environment. This is our current mode of exploration, and I'm not saying we should change this tomorrow. However if the solar system is explored and found sterile, in that case we should attempt to spread life wherever we can within it.\n\nThere is also the more anthropic philosophy which argues we should maximize the amount of humans, which I think is somewhat flawed goal in the extremely long term. We're probably not going to stay as what you could strictly call a single species, and we're probably going to get quite good at modifying nature around us, so I think it makes more sense to look at the whole tree of life over our particular species, and just enjoy that we get to go along for the ride.\n\nWe are a part of a particular tree of life. On a more Machiavellian level, I think this goal makes sense if we want to \"win\" in competition with other trees of life. Until proven otherwise, I think we should assume that life is extremely rare and/or we are extremely early. That means that there are maybe couple other sources of biological life beginning a phase of expansion in our galaxy, similar to ours.

You can argue that you should make anyone pay, however it would become another case of scraping any little bit of money from poor people who simply cannot afford it and do not have it.

(Again, I do not mean to be anti-Chinese.)\n\nHowever, in my opinion, all the arguments I have heard about Chinese social media also apply to American social media.

I don't know about the owners of other major social media such as YouTube or Reddit, but I do not trust any of these people. Any of these might ally with Trump and use their platforms to spread propaganda to support a Trumpist ideology. That could cause a lot of damage to my country and others.\n\nIf Chinese-owned social media are dangerous, then American-owned social media are just as dangerous.

{"Article Number": 247, "title": "CMV: Green card country caps are outdated and should switch to a meritocratic system ", "article": "All the H1B and USA high skilled immigration discourse was triggered from a retweet from Sriram Krishnan, Trump’s new AI advisor, about green card country caps. Those topics are way more complicated so I wanted to focus on the actual issue he mentioned. In this post, I use the terms green card and permanent residency synonymously.  \n\nRight now there are 140k slots annually in the employment route (EB) to get green cards. A max of 7% or 9.8k can go to a single country. This means a country like India that has  hundreds of thousands of applicants have a decades-long queue while other countries get theirs in a couple of years. Realistically any Indian immigrant working in the USA starting this process now won’t get a permanent residency until after they retire in which case they’d no longer have an employer sponsor \n\nThe current system ensures some diversity and a cap of new permanent residents, but that’s about it. I’d argue diversity isn’t a benefit if we want the “most talented” immigrants to have a path towards naturalization. Here are a few reasons why it’s unfair\n\n1) it doesn’t guarantee that the applicants are the top talent in their profession. It’s just whoever applied first\n2) by definition it discriminates based on birth country. At least the h1b is a lottery so it treats everyone more fairly but that also is not meritocratic. While ensuring diversity it also penalizes applicants bc of where they were born which is arguably racist \n3) long PR queues for Indians disincentivizes top talent (all talent which includes the best) from immigrating here which means they’ll stay in India or go elsewhere in the anglosphere.\n4) it doesn’t factor in profession, salary, taxes, or other factors that predict whether they’ll be an assimilated, contributing member of society. There are H1B examples posted recently of mid wage consultants and fraud that can get selected vs someone like Aravind Srinivas, CEO and founder of Perplexity, a $9B dollar company\n5) Businesses need to keep sponsoring H1B for these applicants which is a cost which they could be reinvesting into the company such as creating more jobs. This one is more a minor problem\n6) it doesn’t promote as much competition in the labor market as it could. I believe this would ensure top talent is hired by American companies which helps those companies innovate more, contribute to the economy, and grow the GDP\n\nIt seems like the quotas have not been updated in a while and I’m unsure what’s the point of having a decades long backlog for one country of immigrants. I’d consider my view changed if      \nA) the current system can be shown to benefit the employees, businesses, or the USA  despite these issues    \n   B) these issues are not important enough to warrant reform    \n    C) a meritocratic system would have worse issues than the current system. I recognize defining such a system is hard but I’d imagine it could be done through a combination of university tier (I think the UK does this), compensation, standardized testing, and employer preference and quotas on profession and overall (I am not advocating for opening the flood gates, caps are necessary) Also just because something is hard doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try \n\nThis is also my first post so forgive me if I miss any required formatting or structures in my logic \n\n***EDIT:*** Thanks for the thoughtful replies all. I handed out a few deltas that explain how the current system helps certain groups of people, and how a merit based system would be difficult to administer to warrant the ROI.

{"Article Number": 689, "title": "Part of the reason why women are so disappointed with modern dating is because way women evaluate men doesn't work for selecting an equal relationship.", "article": "This may be confusing, and I don't mean to paint women here with an overly large brush, but some generalizing is necessary. I'll establish the points, which I believe will be mostly agreed upon. We'll start by saying that I'm talking about women seeking men. \n\n1. Women looking for men nowadays find the men they do find disappointing often. You will see \"the bar is on the floor for men\" stated often, by a certain type of person. This may be because of points 2 and 3, which are:\n\n2. Women are desiring more equal relationships than in years past where the income and household work splits are closer to 50/50.\n\n3. Women are still seeking men that will make firm relationship commitments to them. This means monogamy (except where it doesn't, but we aren't talking about those people), and men who will define the relationship firmly, without unnecessary ambiguities. We're talking about women looking for marriage here, at least eventually, which is still a lot of women. \n\n4. Outside of those things, women still want a man who is handsome, has good social skills, dresses well, is in good shape, and earns a strong income, has career drive and ambition, and wants to take care of her, all other things being equal. I may get pushback on the \"takes care of her\" point, but I think many will still find this to be true.\n\n5. Women like it when a man takes charge in the early stages of a relationship, which means asking the woman out, setting the dates, paying for them, and other things. The thing which made my thoughts click is when I saw one woman on online dating say \"Bonus points for you if you can tell me how to dress on our first date\".\n\nI haven't written it out in enough detail to state it simply enough, but I believe what I've come to understand is that women find disappointment because the things they look for in men don't translate to equal relationships. \n\nIn other words, point 1 is basically in contradiction with points 2 through 5. Take the last example I gave in point 5. Having a man tell you how to dress for your first date is pretty patriarchal, no? If you're asking for that, you are telegraphing a patriarchal relationship, and you are selecting for men who will want a more patriarchal relationship. Having a man plan things out for you and pay is 1). telegraphing that you want a man to be in charge of you, and 2), telegraphing that you are an \"item\" that needs to be paid for.\n\nOn point 4, there are a few things. A guy with better social skills will be more socially dominant and less likely to take on the woman's traditional roles in a relationship. A guy with more income will be more focused on his job and will be less inclined to do housework. Additionally, men used to be able to dress well because they had stronger male role models who told them how to dress. If you want less male dominance in society, you would have to accept that there would be fewer male role models around to morph men into the man you would want them to be, and you'll have to take on more of the responsibility. This is admittedly my weakest point. \n\nOn point 3, one of the things which has remained from patriarchy the hardest and which seems to want to go away the least is that the man defines the relationship status, once the woman lets there be one, of course. Think about this; the one thing that the man still pretty much *always* does in a relationship, even now, is be the one to ask the woman to marry him. Feminism has changed much, but it doesn't seem to have changed this. If it's the man's responsibility to do the asking, that puts the power in the man's hands to define the relationship, which is pretty patriarchal.\n\nI'm getting long winded at this point. I think I've figured out a simpler way to state it; as long as you, as a woman, are seeking a relatively modern relationship, but are using the tenets of more traditional masculinity to find a man for that relationship, you are in conflict. \n\nThis has also helped me realize that part of the animosity between men and women is that the statement \"The bar is on the floor for guys\" is sort of true...once the guy is in the relationship. It's definitely not true for  guys who aren't in a relationship already. \n\nINB4:\n\nNo, I am not an i-word.  \nNo, this does not justify i-word rhetoric.  \nNo, this does not justify hating women (or men, for that matter).   \nNo, I am not saying that women should go back to the kitchen, or that we should go back to the 1950's or before.   \nNo, men are not trash.  \nNo, women are not trash.  \nNo, I am not saying you as a woman personally want patriarchy. I am saying that many of the things you may want in a man or in a relationship may be vestiges of patriarchy.   \nNo, I am not saying patricarchy is good.\n\n  \nThank you all and Happy New Year."}

{"Article Number": 500, "title": "Everyone should just tip as much or as little as they want and not feel guilty about it - servers are not entitled to tips", "article": "# Introduction\n\nIt is true that the wages of servers and waiters are usually extremely low. However, remember that people choose this work voluntarily. Any given waiter or server could have instead chosen a different profession and made a much more reasonable guaranteed wage, yet they have chosen not to. Why is that?\n\nThe opportunity to get tipped is actually the primary selling point of the profession itself. It's a big reason why lots of people actually choose to be waiters or servers instead of choosing to be a different profession.\n\nObviously, some people tip more than others, and some people don't tip at all. After all, it is the customer's choice whether or not to tip. You can't force customers to tip, the same way you can't force people to work for low wages. Servers already know this, and despite that, they still choose to be servers anyway.\n\nIt is your right to tip as much or as little as you want. You also have no obligation to tip if you don't want to tip. However, that doesn't stop servers and waiters from believing that they are entitled to tips, even though that is very much a false belief. And it also doesn't stop them from gaslighting people into thinking that people are obligated to tip, even though that is very much false.\n\n# Common Arguments\n\n\"But servers rely on tips for their livelihood! If you don't tip, then they won't be able to pay their bills!\"\n\nIf that's actually true, then they would have already lost their power and water a long time ago. Plenty of customers don't tip. Plenty of servers are still able to pay their bills anyway despite that fact.\n\nIt's not your responsibility as the customer to make sure that the waiter can pay his bills. It's the waiter's responsibility to make sure that he pays his own bills.\n\n\"If you can't afford to tip, then don't go out to eat!\"\n\nThe premise of this argument is the false belief that servers are entitled to tips and that customers must tip. If you reject that false belief, you should also reject this argument. Servers and waiters are just as obligated to serve the customers that don't tip as they are to serve the customers that do tip. If you can't afford to tip, then don't tip. Don't feel bad about it either.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBy pretending like tipping is some kind of moral obligation, and feeling like you must tip every single time, you are simply playing into what the servers want. Tipping is not simply an additional benefit for the servers and for the waiters. No, it is a tool for the customers to use to their advantage.\n\nIf your server does their job properly, then feel free to tip them, if you want to do so. If your server does their job poorly, then don't hesitate to withhold the tip. Servers are not entitled to tips, they must earn them.\n\nThe real benefit of tipping culture is the power that it gives to the customer. As a customer, you have the power to decide how much your server gets paid. Don't give up that power. The worst thing to do, in my opinion, is to just tip a fixed percentage (like 15 or 20 percent) no matter how well the server did. It completely defeats the purpose of tipping, which is to put the customer in the driver's seat."}

There are no 'real' arguments agaist gay marriage. They all depend on religious dogma or irrational homophobia.\n\nMost issues, even ones that I feel strongly toward one side about, **have** real arguments on the contrary side.

I believe the right to self-defense, and not restricting law abiding citizens because of the acts of deranged criminals, are **stronger** arguments.

Gingrich is the one who cultivated the hatred of Clinton and the obsession with him and was one of the first to cultivate the distribution of conspiracies and \"fake news\"\n\nBut not just his behavior, lets take a deeper look in how Gingrich truly shaped modern Conservatism: Gingrich also shaped the ideology of modern Conservatism.

By spending more than we can afford, sacrificing conservative values for the sake of easy answers, and electing the most liberal president ever, America is at risk for its very survival. The Obama administration is conspiring to transform our America of free enterprise, faith, and personal freedom into their America of endless bureaucracy, secularism, and state control—despite overwhelming opposition from the American people. “Our federal government is broken,” Gingrich states, “we must ‘replace, not reform’ our leaders and our policies.”\n\nJust read it!

{"Article Number": 259, "title": "CMV: I Believe Pro-Lifers are Disingenuous", "article": "The main belief of the Pro-Life camp is that abortion is murder and murder is wrong, therefore abortion should be banned. Obviously there’s nuance and variation there, but that’s the main pillar of pro-life ideology. They claim that life begins at conception and that’s when the zygote/embryo/fetus (ZEF) has their own unique set of DNA and is on the path to becoming a fully developed human being, so it is wrong to kill them and strip that potential future away from them.\n\nI’d like to list all of my reasons for why I think pro-lifers are disingenuous:\n\n1) Pro-lifers can’t even prove that abortion bans actually result in a decrease in abortions. \n\nIf anything, abortions have increased since Roe v Wade was overturned in the US. And many of the countries with the highest rates of abortion every year are abortion ban countries. In fact, on average abortion ban countries actually do have more abortions than those without bans. \n\nhttps://www.cfr.org/article/abortion-law-global-comparisons\n\nNow obviously pro-lifers can always say “correlation does not equal causation,” but all that does is attempt to attribute the reason for these increases in abortion rates to something other than the abortion bans. That still doesn’t negate the fact that abortion did increase, which means the ban at the very least certainly didn’t cause any decrease—let alone a significant decrease—in abortions. And it may have even caused the increase. So all we can really conclude is that abortion bans either 1) Do absolutely nothing, not preventing a singular net abortion. Or 2) They actually are counter-productive and might even cause more abortions.\n\nIn addition to this, we also know that any restrictions placed on abortions make it more difficult for women to obtain even the medically necessary abortions, which has harmed and even killed women in abortion ban countries (including a small number in the U.S. so far). So if sacrificing innocent women is worth saving fetal lives, then in my opinion, abortion bans had better save a significant number of fetal lives to make up for the sacrifice of these innocent women. But pro-lifers can’t even prove that abortion bans prevent *any* abortions (net abortions). \n\nSo to me it seems pro-“lifers” are very disingenuous when it comes to “valuing the life of every human being” because not only do abortion bans prevent zero abortions, but they also harm and even kill women in the process. That’s not pro-“life” at all. \n\nAlso, if you really wanted to prevent abortions, then why wouldn’t you advocate for things that we know for a fact prevent abortions WITHOUT harming/killing women as a side effect? The countries with the lowest rates of abortion have things in common: paid maternity leave, free maternal and child healthcare (or just free healthcare in general), free access to all contraceptives, mandated sex education in schools multiple times every semester starting at puberty, and legalized abortions. The countries with all of these things in place have very low abortion rates, without harming/killing women. If people truly were “pro-life,” you’d think they’d advocate for those things to prevent abortion instead of abortion bans. \n\n2) Pro-lifers often argue that the life of the ZEF is equal in value to a born person’s life, therefore the mother’s bodily sovereignty and health are not good enough reasons to justify killing the ZEF. \n\nI don’t believe for one second that pro-lifers actually believe that the life of an embryo has exactly the same value as the life of a born person. If a pro-lifer was in a burning building and they could either save a child or a suitcase with 100,000 embryos in it, they’re going to save the child. I don’t believe for one second that they would choose to save the suitcase and leave the child to die. That’s because we *don’t* value embryos exactly the same as born human beings. If we did, then that hypothetical wouldn’t even be a moral dilemma, it would be an extremely easy choice: save the embryos and leave the child to die. You’re saving 100,000 lives as opposed to 1. But every time I ask this question to pro-lifers (“which one do you save?”) they hesitate and say it’s a hard choice, or they pick the child. If you truly valued an embryo EXACTLY THE SAME as a child, however, then you wouldn’t even hesitate; you’d choose the embryos instantly.  So I don’t believe pro-lifers are being sincere when they say they value ZEFs exactly the same as born people. \n\nIf you wanted to say “well, equal in value or not, they still have value and therefore it’s not right to kill them,” then that’s at least a little more believable. But that’s not what the pro-life camp believes or says in their campaigns. \n\n3) Murder is not the same as abortion, yet pro-lifers pretend that it is. Is it killing a human being intentionally? Yes. Is that always murder? No. If you kill someone intentionally in self-defense, that is not murder. If you kill someone in war, that is also not considered murder but a “casualty” (or a “success” to some). If you euthanize someone to end their suffering, that’s also not murder. If you enact the death penalty on someone, that’s also not murder. So you can’t just say “the premeditated, intentional killing of another human being makes it murder.” No, it doesn’t. And you know that. \n\nThe woman actually has very real reasons for killing the ZEF to preserve her own bodily sovereignty, health, and life. It doesn’t matter how “rare” you think complications during pregnancy and childbirth are. The fact remains that a woman’s health and life are at greater risk while pregnant than if she was not pregnant. She doesn’t want someone living inside of her anymore, and she doesn’t want to give birth. That’s very different from cold-blooded murder just because you want someone to die. She just doesn’t want to be pregnant or give birth, and unfortunately the only way to stop that is to kill the ZEF. So no, that is not the same as murder. And I don’t believe pro-lifers view it the same way either, because you certainly don’t see them grieving the losses of thousands of not millions of ZEF’s every year due to IUDs killing them after fertilization. IUDs usually prevent sperm from reach the egg, but when they fail to do that, they resort to plan B which is to prevent the zygote/embryo’s implantation in the uterus, killing it. Pro-lifers aren’t calling women with IUDs mass murderers, so they obviously don’t actually believe that abortion is murder. \n\n4) The majority of pro-lifers are men. If these pro-life men really wanted to see a decrease in abortions, then they’d need to advocate for a decrease in unwanted pregnancies. The best way to do that is to get vasectomies themselves, if they plan on having sex with women but don’t want to get them pregnant. And they should be encouraging other men to do the same, including pro-choice men who don’t want to get women pregnant but do want to keep having sex. \n\nVasectomies are usually reversible, just depends on your body and how long you’ve had the vasectomy for. But even if it’s not reversible, that doesn’t matter because men can just put their sperm in a sperm bank and freeze it for the future just in case. We can also extract sperm from the testes or epididymis, so no matter what men will never be sterilized by vasectomies. And VasalGel will be perfected soon and marketable. But whenever I make these suggestions that men should be encouraged to *actually contribute* if they want abortions to decrease, pro-life men always respond that that’s an attack on *their* bodily autonomy. Given what they’re advocating for?? That’s extremely disingenuous. \n\nI have more reasons honestly but I’ll just stick to these main 4 reasons for now. Change My View.\n\n", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 453, "title": "CANADIANS ONLY: Pierre Poilievre is going to be PM, and not only are you going to be fine, you're going to be better off than under Trudeau.", "article": "You can tell how close Poilievre is to being PM by how much Canadian reddit discussions focus on him. Now that Trudeau is screwed, and any replacements for him before an election has to be called are probably going to be Kim Campbelled, left-wing Reddit is focusing heavily on attacking him. These attacks are mostly not substantive, and this post includes a few reasons why. \n\n1. \"He has no policy/ only attacks Trudeau/ only has empty slogans!\"\n\nAs the Leader of Opposition, he doesn't have to put forth policy proposals. That isn't his job. His job is to hold the government to account. This, by nature, means that he will do more attacking the government than putting forth policy proposals. It also means he's going to do a lot of attacking Trudeau - that is his job. It's true, he's a lot more curt than other conservatives about doing it, and says mean words sometimes. This, in my view, is a good thing. Why should politics be about being nice all the time, especially when your opponent hates you, and your opponent has written the rules of engagement for the last hundred years? And considering Trudeau has done a remarkably shit job of being PM, it's good that he hits hard and plays a little dirty. Canada has had remarkably pussy-whipped conservatives for a while, and you should be thankful one of them has realized there's a market for being aggressive against a radlib Prime Minister.\n\nAlso, the slogans are working. \"Ax The Tax\" isn't the most complex piolicy proposal, but it's in your head, and you're talking about it. That's the point. Don't get mad about it, get mad that your guys aren't as good at branding. That's why Poilievre does them.\n\nAlso - he does have policy, it's just that it's not advantageous for him to reveal it now. That would make him the focus of the media cycle, and that would allow our radlib press to just deconstruct him rather than reporting on anything else.  But with that said, here's a list of policy proposals which will probably be a part of his campaign when the writ drops (sourced from ChatGPT, admittedly):\n\n**Economic Policy:**\n\n* **Balanced Budgets:** Introduce a \"pay-as-you-go\" law requiring the government to offset any new spending with equivalent cuts elsewhere to control deficits and combat inflation.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Bank of Canada Reforms:** Replace the Governor of the Bank of Canada, audit the institution, and prohibit the implementation of a central bank digital currency.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Cryptocurrency Adoption:** Promote the use of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, aiming to make Canada the \"blockchain capital of the world.\"[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Defunding the

Canadians.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Housing and Infrastructure:**\n\n* **Increase Housing Supply:** Mandate major cities with unaffordable housing to boost new home construction by 15% annually, with federal infrastructure funding tied to these targets.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Utilize Federal Properties:** Sell 15% of under-utilized federal buildings to convert them into affordable housing units.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Airport Expansion:** Approve the expansion of the runway at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport to allow jet operations, enhancing competition in the aviation sector.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Environment and Energy:**\n\n* **Carbon Tax Repeal:** Eliminate the federal carbon tax, viewing it as detrimental to the economy.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Promote Green Technology:** Focus on technological solutions like carbon capture and storage to address climate change, rather than taxation.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Energy Independence:** Ban foreign oil imports and revisit previously canceled pipeline projects to boost domestic energy production.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Healthcare:**\n\n* **Support Public Healthcare:** Commit to maintaining Canada's public healthcare system.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Address Healthcare Shortages:** Implement interprovincial standardization for doctors and nurses through a \"Blue Seal\" program and expedite credential recognition for internationally trained health professionals.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Uphold Healthcare Funding:** Honor existing healthcare funding agreements with provinces, while advocating for increased funding.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Immigration:**\n\n* **Adjust Immigration Levels:** Link immigration numbers to housing availability and public service capacity, proposing reductions in asylum seekers and temporary residents to align with Canada's infrastructure.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Enhance Border Security:** Strengthen measures against illegal immigration, including amending the Safe Third Country Agreement and reinstating visa requirements for certain countries.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Social Issues:**\n\n*

matters.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Same-Sex Marriage:** Support same-sex marriage, acknowledging its success in Canada.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Drug Policy:** Oppose the decriminalization of hard drugs, advocating for increased treatment and recovery services for individuals with addictions, and propose legal action against pharmaceutical companies contributing to the opioid crisis.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Foreign Policy:**\n\n* **International Relations:** Criticize international organizations like the World Economic Forum, expressing opposition to their agendas, and propose banning ministers and top government officials from attending their annual summits. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Conservative_Party_of_Canada_leadership_election?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n  \n2. \"He's never had a job!\"\n\nThat would be a valid point if he were running against a party of people who had jobs. He is not. If you were willing to vote for Trudeau, who has nursed at the government teat his whole life, you cannot make this argument against voting for Poilievre.  And while government experience isn't ideal for a conservative, he's had a lot of cabinet positions.\n\n3. \"He's an extremist/He's a Nayzi!\"\n\nHe is not. The core of his campaign is getting rid of a tax. It's about as milquetoast of a conservative goal as you can get. \n\n4. \"He's gonna ban abortion!\"\n\nAbortion is pretty much Canada's second most sacred cow after healthcare. We made Mortengaler a member of the OOC. As sourced from ChatGPT, he won't personally touch abortion. I do concede that if he gets over 250 seats the Conservatives may have a free vote on some issue like banning late-term abortion and that may pass. That's as far as it's going to get. You're going to be able to kill as many babies for as long as you want.\n\n5. \"He's working for the oligarchs!\"\n\nThis is the best liberal point, and would be a good point if it weren't that the Liberals are also the oligarch party in Canada. In fact more so. Canada is basically a state of Oligarchs. Air Canada, the banks, the housing giants, the telecoms, the Irvings, the Westons; in Canada, these  groups and peopleare untouchable. I do think Poilievre will be better for the economy because he'll be better at reducing housing costs and forcing municipalities to build, and will probably reduce immigration at least somewhat, putting less strain on housing, but luckily  for him, he's running against an NDP which is regarded and the Liberals, who are the oligarchs. So this one's a wash. \n\nAnyways, even I am not super excited about him, but I'm not impressed because I think he isn't conservative enough, not because he is too conservative. I do think he's smarter and more competent than Trudeau, and I'm cautiously optimistic about him. Please discuss. ", "authorship": "human"}

Watching some women's reaction to male loneliness epidemic, convinced me that women won't solve the male epidemic issue. \n\nBest solution to male loneliness epidemic is for men have deeper emotional connection with other men. The problem is men associate this deep emotional connection as gay or a sign of weakness. That should be removed. Men need to step up and actually take care of each other, men should be more emotionally supportive towards each other and be there for them when they need it. Have a more emotional brotherly bond, not shame your friends for being more feminine and such. \n\nBecause one thing I learned is that women are not good at solving men's problems because they simply don't understand it. They really don't get men's problems. So it shouldn't be their responsibility to help men solve men's problems. Before you say \"why should men care about women's problems then\" the thing is many men are just as dismissive as women, if not more dismissive sometimes. Women are taking care of their own issues, it's time men do the same for their own.\n\nBesides, do you really want a woman who is that dismissive and don't actually care to be involved with men's issues? \n\nYeah no, so I don't think women should be involved in this issue not should we expect them to be involved.

Tesla, as a private corporation, has captured a large share of the global EV market. SpaceX, as a private corporation, is way ahead of any private or government entity in terms of launch price and capability.

When you think of trying to cure diabetes, it is usually in the case of detection (blood sugar), mitigations, or some kind of drug that moderates blood sugar. Add to that numerous research labs (some academic, some corporate) that are all busy attacking various problems. But so much of this is just nibbling around the edges! I feel like nobody has really tried to attack the problem directly, such as with tissue regeneration. They've done it in mice. Why not just spend 50 billion dollars on some method that could directly cure the disease? I guarantee you that the first billionaire to create a company for this problem and solve it would become the first trillioniare. And probably get a horse's head in his bed. Again, you can argue with this point, but I think you get the idea.\n\nIn summary, I think the profit motive is a great way for billionaires to spend money, since they have the money to achieve escape velocity in a lot of areas, can pursue many avenues that governments are not interested in, and can employ many people. It's just a much better proposition, and there are numerous ideas one could use."}
{"Article Number": 404, "title": "Modern atheism has become so toxic, cult-like, and anti-religion that it has ironically become a religion itself", "article": "I believe the majority of atheists are sensible people who simply do not believe in the concept of a higher power such as God, such as myself. However, I am disgusted at how modern atheism has become a toxic anti-religion echo chamber online by a large minority of radicalised vocal individuals.\n\nWikipedia defines religion as \"*range of social-cultural systems, including designated behaviors and practices, morals, beliefs, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that generally relate humanity to supernatural, transcendental, and spiritual elements—although there is no scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a religion*\".\n\nTherefore, I argue that pure atheism is a standardised, stringent set of systems, behaviours, and practices that purely originate from personal conviction and worldviews. It must not originate from reactionary opposition to religious belief, nor should it be defined by the hostility that some radicalised atheists express toward religious communities. Instead, atheism in its purest form should be understood as a philosophical stance on the lack of an existence of a higher power, reached through individual reflection, not groupthink or tribalism.\n\nAtheism should not become, paradoxically, a quasi-religion of anti-religion. When atheism adopts a rigid orthodoxy of hostility toward belief, it risks becoming the very thing it seeks to oppose: an ideological system rooted in dogma and intolerance. True atheism, I believe, should not concern itself with tearing down religious traditions but instead focus on affirming a worldview based on secular ethics and rational intellectual inquiry.\n\nMany online atheist communities, particularly on certain subreddits, focus excessively on mocking the worst aspects of religion without offering a thoughtful, purist atheist perspective. Instead of exploring secular ethics or existential meaning, they reduce atheism to reactionary ridicule, turning it into a shallow opposition rather than a meaningful worldview. Members of these communities often perpetuate a bleak life-outlook of helplessness, depression, and a void of meaning, when in truth, pure atheism can offer just as much purpose, fulfillment, and moral clarity as religion.\n\nIn short, atheism should be a personal conclusion, not a crusade.\n\nTLDR: Atheism should be a personal conclusion, not an anti-religion crusade.

In World War II, the United States seized control of the island and, since then, has had de facto military control of the island. Even as Denmark still holds de jure control of the island. There are more American soldiers than Danes on the island, Despite Denmark initially refusing to host the Americans.\n\nI don't think America will ever leave. As an American, I believe the United States will only leave if it no longer sees a reason to keep control; if there's no interest, we will go home. But America's interest in Greenland isn't economic or a defense. Greenland has been something American politicians wanted for Ideological reasons. America has seen Greenland (and other European colonies in the new world) as immoral and oppressive intrusions into America's sphere of influence. The idea that America is a \"guardian of liberty\" for the rest of the hemisphere has been ingrained into our identity since the beginning. That's why America liberated Cuba from Spain and didn't annex it afterward. That's why America wanted Greenland, even when nothing was strategic or economic. Now that there is money, there is a near-zero chance of America \"going home.\" \n\nOn the other hand, Denmark will never let go of Greenland willingly. Greenland is the last holding of their empire. It's a prestige symbol for them. It always has been. They were unwilling to give it up when they were burned to the ground, and America had total control of the island in WW2. They definitely won't give it up now.

{"Article Number": 96, "title": "CMV: There’s no beauty in efficiency ", "article": "I’ve been reflecting on the idea that efficiency is a form of beauty, inspired by a post I read from Mr. Money Mustache where he argued that efficiency is “a high form of beauty.” While I understand the appeal of this perspective—efficiency often carries a sense of order, elegance, and resourcefulness—I believe it misses something essential about beauty and what it means to live a fulfilling, meaningful life.\n\nFrom an existentialist perspective, efficiency is a fundamentally utilitarian concept, and beauty transcends utility. Philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus emphasized the inherent absurdity of life and the idea that meaning is something we create, not something we extract from systems, structures, or results. Sartre argued that existence precedes essence, meaning we are not defined by what we achieve or how efficiently we achieve it, but by the freedom and authenticity of our choices. Efficiency, by contrast, prioritizes results over freedom.\n\nAlbert Camus, in The Myth of Sisyphus, beautifully captured the tension between human effort and the absurdity of life. Sisyphus endlessly rolls a boulder up a hill, only for it to roll back down. Camus invites us to imagine him happy—not because his actions are efficient or productive, but because he embraces the struggle itself as an act of rebellion against life’s absurdity. The beauty here lies in the act of persistence, not in achieving a streamlined outcome.\n\nMoreover, Søren Kierkegaard’s concept of the aesthetic stage of life offers a critique of efficiency as beauty. Kierkegaard distinguishes between the aesthetic, ethical, and religious modes of existence. The aesthetic mode seeks beauty, pleasure, and fulfillment, but this beauty is deeply personal and subjective, tied to passions, emotions, and experiences—not to the rational optimization of processes. To conflate beauty with efficiency risks reducing the richness of human experience to mere functionality.\n\nIn art, love, or nature—domains traditionally associated with beauty—inefficiency is often where we find the sublime. A painter may spend weeks agonizing over a single brushstroke; a lover may write countless drafts of a letter that never gets sent. These acts are profoundly human and beautiful precisely because they resist optimization. To impose the logic of efficiency on them would strip them of their essence.\n\nCamus famously wrote, “One must imagine Sisyphus happy.” I would argue that one must also imagine him inefficient—choosing detours, embracing mistakes, and finding beauty in the chaotic, messy, and imperfect nature of existence. To equate beauty with efficiency is to miss what makes life meaningful: the struggle, the spontaneity, and the creative potential of inefficiency.\n\n(blog post that inspired this: https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2016/11/24/efficiency-is-the-highest-form-of-beauty)", "authorship": "human"}

The belief in a shared, finite resource of which all have access to (the environment/planet’s resources), and that everyone will ultimately act within their own self-interest to extract the most value possible before said resource is depleted. The driving force behind the fallacy, is that since we all expect everyone else to act dishonestly within their own self-interest, hence we too act within our self-interests, because why should we put in effort if nobody else will? Despite this being a fallacy (a false notion), I personally believe it to be gospel throughout human history.

{"Article Number": 95, "title": "I hate it when people simplify complex ideas and think they’re smart for it. It’s the opposite.", "article": "Context: It’s when an idea is nuanced, yet people act like you’re overcomplicating things when all you’re doing is showing that it’s not so simple. You explain your reasoning thoroughly, but they ignore everything you’ve said and respond with something like, \"Just bla bla bla, simple. No need to overcomplicate. \". \n\nHere is a concrete example:\n\n**Me:** \"If we’re talking about sugar in the context of health, there are two categories of sugar to be aware of: simple sugars and complex sugars. You shouldn’t consume more than 36g of simple sugar in a day, but for complex sugars, it’s okay to eat more, as long as you’re mindful of the calories. Simple sugars are found in beverages, processed foods, etc., while complex sugars are found in fruits, rice, and similar foods. However, fruit juice should be counted as simple sugar because it’s just as damaging. In fact, we don’t need simple sugar at all.\"\n\n**The Typical:** \"Why can’t you just say sugar is bad? Simple and easy to understand.\"\n\nThen, they proceed to stop eating all kinds of sugar, rice, corn, pasta—anything with carbohydrates—and later blame \"science\" for making them sick. In reality, they are the ones who oversimplified the information, misunderstood it, and hurt themselves because of it.\n\nNext, they do a 180 flip. Since \"science\" supposedly hurt them, they turn to their like-minded peers to echo the sentiment that \"science is bad.\" Now, they go to the opposite extreme: eating all kinds of sugar without moderation. Over time, they gain additional weight and develop long-term health issues from consuming too much simple sugar.\n\nThe reality is, some concepts simply can’t be simplified without losing crucial details. It’s not complicated by choice—it’s complicated by necessity. Most things in life are not that simple.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Another Example:**  \n**Me:** \"The news is very biased. If you only listen to one side, it can brainwash you into siding with them.\"  \n**Context:** I’m talking to someone who ONLY watches Chinese media and believes China is the leader in space travel.  I'm not against China, but this is simply not true.\n\n**Them:** \"But this is international news—it’s available to everyone. They can’t lie, or there would be consequences. Everyone can see it. They wouldn’t lie.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Outright lying isn’t the only way they can manipulate you. There are many ways. For instance, they can only report their successes while showing only the failures of others. This creates the illusion that their side is winning, even though the reality could be the opposite. For example, if China highlights two of its successful launches but hides ten failures, while only reporting two U.S. failures and ignoring ten U.S. successes, you’re going to think China is ahead. But in reality, it’s just cherry-picking data. No one holds them accountable for this because they technically didn’t lie. They just omitted information to create a narrative. You can’t sue a media outlet for omitting details. And even if someone calls them out for it, you wouldn’t know, because you only get information from them.\"\n\n**Them:** They refuse to comprehend and keep repeating: \"But it’s international news. Everyone can see it. If they do anything bad, there would be consequences. They wouldn’t do that.\"\n\n**Me:** In disbelief, I try another example: \"Another way they could manipulate is by presenting allegations as if they were convictions. For instance, anyone could falsely accuse you of rape—\"\n\n**Them:** They cut me off. \"DON’T say someone might sue me for that. It’s negative! Blah blah blah.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Okay, let’s say it’s John. If someone hates John, they could arrange for a false accusation of rape. The media could title it, 'John Alleged to Have Sexually Abused a College Student.' Most people don’t care about 'innocent until proven guilty.' They’ll assume it’s true just from the headline. The majority of the population actually behave this way. Just look at Johny Dep; you're probably one as well.\n\n**Them:** \"Nah, they wouldn’t do that.\"\n\n**Me:** got mad, and start explaining it in obvious way.  \nThem: \"Why can't you just simply say the news outlet is fake\".  \nMe: BUT IT's NOT FAKE, OMG.   \n  \nThey simplify \"News can manipulate you\" into two extremes:\n\n1. \"News won’t lie because there’s accountability.\"\n2. \"News is fake, so never trust any news.\"\n\nReality is far more nuanced. The media often uses omission, selective reporting, and framing to manipulate narratives without technically lying. This isn’t \"complicating\" the issue—it’s acknowledging how manipulation works in practice. And the solution isn't to completely trust the news or completely ignore the news. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nAnother:  \n**Them:** \"Complicated math is useless outside of school.\"  \n**Me:** \"It depends on what you do! If you’re flipping burgers, playing sports, working as a lawyer, or in some subsets of business and other professions, then yes, it’s useless because you’re not going to use it. But for those interested in fields like engineering, computer science, and similar areas, this math isn’t anywhere near useless—it’s foundational. The same people who claim math is useless are never the ones designing airplanes, creating games, building bridges blueprints, or tackling complex engineering marvels.\"\n\n**Them:** \"But I’ve never had to use it, and I’m still doing fine.\"  \n**Me:** \"I know, and that’s because you’re not interested in a field that requires it. But you’re assuming that everyone’s goal is just to be 'doing fine.' What about people who are passionate about fields that depend on advanced math and want to work in those areas? If they take your advice, they’re screwed.\"\n\nThem: \"Well, just don't do those job, only money matter anyway, simple and easy to understand\".  \n\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThere’s so much more I could say, but the point is that when you simplify something, you’re inevitably dropping important details. That’s literally the only way to simplify.\n\nAnd don’t hit me with the quote, *\"If you can’t explain it to a 5-year-old, you don’t really understand it.\"* That’s complete nonsense. You absolutely can’t explain something like general relativity to a 5-year-old without skipping 90% of the details that make it functional.\n\nIf you think you understand general relativity, try simplifying it for a 5-year-old. You’ll quickly realize that what you’re presenting isn’t the real thing—it’s a dumbed-down version. People often mistake understanding a simplified version for understanding the actual concept. But knowing a watered-down explanation is not the same as truly understanding the full complexity.\n\nNow, as for the title, Simplifying complex ideas is not smart, it's the opposite. \n\nI said that because people often mistake the ability to simplify as something \"smart.\" It’s not. Simplifying is the easy part—you just omit all the details, and things become simple. That’s how most people do it, and they get praised for it. But it’s easy to do that.\n\nWhat’s hard is actually tackling the problem head-on and being willing to dig through all the nuance. That’s the smart part—being critical and thoughtful rather than a simpleton. Simplifying is easy because all you’re doing is omitting details.\n\nFor example:\n\n* It's much easier to say \"Don't eat sugar\" or \"It's okay to eat sugar\" rather than explain that there are different kind of sugar. \n* It's much easier to say \"The news is fake\" or \"The news is not fake\" rather than to explain how news can manipulate you and how you can resist it. \n* It's much easier to say \"Math is useless\" or \"Math is useful\" rather than explaining how it's subjective to individual. \n* It’s much easier to say, \"John stole because he’s a bad person,\" than to say, \"John stole. His action is wrong, but there might be a reason for it—maybe he was desperate. This doesn’t justify it, but understanding the reasoning helps.\"\n* It’s much easier to say, \"Women and men are the same,\" than to say, \"There are areas where women are better than men and areas where men are better than women. We are generally different, but we all deserve the same rights, opportunities, and treatment.\"\n* It’s much easier to say, \"You hate Black people, so you’re racist,\" than to say, \"You’re not racist. You hate John because he stole from you, and he happens to be Black. It’s not about his skin color; it’s about his actions.

{"Article Number": 251, "title": "Plenty of prostitutes are in the business because they like it. ", "article": "When you mention prostitution here on Reddit, you will instantly be bombarded by a crowd of angry people who claim that all women in prostitution are being exploited and either do it because they are forced to or because they have no way out. And that to a woman being paid for sex by a man just feels like being violated. \n\nI've in the past visited my fair share of prostitutes and erotic massage places. And frankly I have never had this experience. I remember the first time I visited a prostitute. It was a middle aged woman, living in a large house in a posh village with expensive cars in their driveway. Her husband had his own business, her kids were in college. She simply enjoyed the thrill of being a typical suburban housewife by day, while secretly being a prostitute by night. \n\nAnd those types I've seen more often. It should be said they are not the 21 year old Asian women with the tight body, but usually 40+ housewives and often a bit overweight. Their motives can be; \n\n\\- Just having a very liberal mentality towards sex with strangers and seeing it as an easy way to make a living (or an extra income). \n\n\\- Being into specific fetishes. Especially in the BDSM scene or when their partner is a cuck who liked to watch (or sometimes the husband might join). \n\n\\- Sometimes, simply being paid for sex is the fetish. \n\nAnother example would be an erotic masseuse I really liked to visit because she is very good at her job. She told me that when she came to the Netherlands, she first worked in a warehouse for 9 hours a day doing harsh physical labor and was very depressed. She finds live as an erotic massage therapist much more relaxed plus one client for 1 hour a day is enough for her to get by so she has a lot of free time. \n\nA final example was a 26 year old college student, to who being paid for sex seemed to be a bucketlist thing she wanted to try. She was very exited and actually responded genuinely disappointed when I declined a blowjob for instance. \n\nSure, I admit that I'm cherry picking here, and these are not the majority of all prostitutes. But they do exist. And when you know how to look for them, I guarantee you they offer you a much more high quality experience, with the added benefit that in the end you know both of you enjoyed it and you didn't take advantage of anyone.

Restricting body armor is no better than saying *'We want anyone with a gun to be able to kill you easily.'* And getting shot while wearing armor is not just nothing. People still get incapacitated temporarily, like being punched very hard. Body armor will just keep you from dying. I do not see any moral justification for restricting body armor, which can only save lives, and not take any.\n\nEdit: This does not apply to laws that do not affect otherwise law abiding citizens. I could see supporting laws that make committing some other crime while wearing body armor an aggravating factor or another crime altogether."}

However, saying OnlyFans isn’t bad, or saying it’s “feminism,” or supporting it is still supporting pornography at the basic level. Yes, I understand it’s safer for the people doing it or the sex workers who need money. However, it’s still porn. Calling out people who watch OnlyFans and have a porn addiction while in the same breath having an OnlyFans and supplying porn is hypocritical. Doing it is fueling porn addictions. Just like drug dealers supply drugs, people who do OnlyFans supply the thing porn addicts use to get off. It just seems contradictory to me. \n\nAlso, OnlyFans is not feminism.

{"Article Number": 267, "title": "CMV: The demons in Frieren could be integrated into human society under certain circumstances", "article": "As presented in the anime, demons have the following traits:\n\n* They are monsters - creatures of the magical world that hunt and antagonize creatures of the natural world.\n* Demons are monsters that imitate humans to better hunt and eat them.\n* Demons are capable of language, though they primarily use it as a tool of deception among humans.\n* Demons are somewhat social, and they have a \"might makes right\" mentality among their own kind that allows them to work together to fight human armies.\n* Demons are capable of long-term planning, and can resist their instincts long enough for elaborate acts of deception (like the demon ambassadors.)\n* Every demon choses to perfect a single spell over their long lives, often creating spells so good that humans and elves are unable to alter or improve them without intense study.\n\nPersonally, I think these are all of the things we need to know to say that demons could, in theory, be incorporated into human society under the right circumstances.\n\nThis may seem odd to say. After all, the demons are a bit like the Myrmarachne spiders that mimic ants in order to invade their colonies and eat their larvae. From the ants' perspective, the spiders aren't even necessarily \"evil\" - the two animals just want mutually incompatible things. One to eat, and the other to not be eaten.\n\nHowever, I think if the elves and humanity were ever to have a position of signifigant strength over the demons, it might make sense to offer the demons clemency in exchange for a regular diet of death row inmates or conquered foreign humans. The reason they might want to do that is because it seems clear that demons are uniquely capable of inovating spells, and while humans and elves have learned a lot as the enemies of demonkind - I think they could learn even more as \"tamers\" of demonkind working alongside them in a more orderly arrangement.\n\nUnfortunately, I think that the humans and elves of Frieren are still on the back foot, even with the defeat of the Demon King, and so the current best solution for them is to kill every demon on sight. However, if they managed to decimate enough of the demonic forces, I think it would make perfect sense to try to turn a small group of suriviving demons into a research team to improve knowledge of magic. Who knows, maybe they'd even be able to find a spell that could remove demonkind's bloodlust for humans or that could help the three species find more common ground, and not need to kill one another on sight.\n\n\n\n", "authorship": "human"}
