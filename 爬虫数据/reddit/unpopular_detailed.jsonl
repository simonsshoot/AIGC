Most people love an artist, actor so much to the point they say things like, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs such a green flag, she‚Äôs so kind, oh he‚Äôd never do something like that‚Äù.

There are sooo many ways this will always go wrong. One instance that‚Äôs infuriating, when these attractive actors that act sweet on camera get in trouble for assault, fans are so quick to share their opinion on what they think really happened when we don‚Äôt know shit.

Even if you're in the top 10% of human memory capabilities, your memory sucks.\n\nThere's too many cases where you tell someone something like \"hey, can you bring plates to the potluck that's 3 weeks away?\" They agree, then completely forget because they didn't write it down anywhere. They were completely dependent on someone else reminding them or just hoping they remembered it themselves as the date got closer.\n\nIt can be anything, like here's some examples:\n\n* Returning borrowed items (e.g., books, tools, or containers).\n* Replacing a lightbulb or fixing a minor repair.\n* Getting your tires rotated or changed.\n* Calling or texting someone back.\n* Paying a bill before the due date.\n* Submitting a report or project by a deadline.\n* Booking or rescheduling a doctor‚Äôs or dentist appointment.\n* Filing expense reports or timesheets.\n* Bringing snacks or drinks for a kids‚Äô activity or sports event.\n* Picking up dry cleaning or alterations.\n* Sending a thank-you note or follow-up after a gathering.\n* Vacuuming, sweeping, or tidying up a space.\n* Scheduling an oil change or car inspection.\n* Replacing batteries in smoke detectors or remotes.\n* Backing up data or saving work before shutting down a computer.\n* Returning a library book or rental.\n* Mailing a letter or package.\n* Bringing materials for a presentation or discussion.\n* Ordering or restocking supplies.\n* Picking up groceries or specific ingredients for dinner.\n\nNearly everyone screws up these basic tasks because \"woops I forgot\".

For example, if you think about the workplace.  I've worked in a variety of industries.  Some places had good training.  Some had none.  Some employees were highly motivated and had a samurai like mentality of excellence.  Some literally did not give a shit except for money.  However, the vast majority of employees who just showed up and did their job for six months or more became skilled at their jobs.  Simply the fact of showing up and doing something almost every day, where you have an obvious incentive to master it to at least some extant, and unlimited opportunities to observe what works and what doesn't, gets most people to a point where they can do something decently.\n\nWhen I think about things in my life I wanted to do and either something happened or not, the secret sauce usually was \"just doing it\".  For example, I had a period where I was really interested in chess.  I decided to \"just do it\" and start playing in tournaments.  This meant that I was now talking to other chess players (community), getting coached by better players, hearing others talk about their routine.  Interacting with others, I got clearer about my intentions.  After a while, talking to one of my coaches, I realized that I wasn't that passionate about chess as I'd hoped and felt a need to take care of other priorities, which while sad, was again learning about my real needs and priorities.\n\nSo in essence, \"just do it\" contains everything in a nutshell, because when you really make your mind up to do something difficult for you and start putting in the work, you will learn all the other things.\n\nWhereas honestly, for me usually when I fail to make progress, it's because I make excuses, either just normal \"it's not the right time\" type excuses, or for me, engaging in an infinite number of preliminary personal development exercises, reading, psychologizing, or otherwise searching for some magic key (including magic) that will make things simple.", "authorship": "human"}

I just think that the argument \"it's only fair for the person who earns more to pay more of the expenses\" is wrong.*\n\nI'll use an extreme example just to illustrate my point. Let's consider person A and person B. When they were 20 years old, both had a passion for art. Both had the exact same opportunities open to them. Let's even say both are the same gender, same race and same socio-economic background to eliminate any argument about systemic discrimination.\n\nPerson A decided that pursuing a career in art was too risky because it's very unlikely that you would make a good living out of it. So they decided on another life plan. They chose to sacrifice their twenties. They started to study finance: they enrolled in a prestigious school, took on tons of st\\*dent d\\*bt (had to censor that because of automod), and spent 5 years studying very hard. They then got a soul-crushing job at 25. By the time they're 30, they have changed employers twice because that was the best way to get a raise. They didn't care about getting a fulfilling job; they only cared about making as much money as possible and living way below their means so they could retire early and make up for their lost twenties in their forties.\n\nAt 30, person A has a net worth of 0 because they only just paid off their st\\*dent d\\*bts. They have 0 friends because they changed job so frequently, they never formed any meaningful connection. They work a job they hate. However, they are making $150,000 a year. They are living a lifestyle well below what they could afford, with only $30,000 in expenses, so they can save 80% of their income and hope to retire before 45.\n\nPerson B decided to pursue their passion for art because they value experiences over financial security. They studied at a cheap community college for a few years, then found a job as a graphic designer. It didn't pay much, but it was fulfilling. They kept the same job, and their colleagues became close friends. Since they were working a fulfilling job, person B never had the plan to retire early. They took advantage of their twenties to have fun, travel, go to music festivals every year, and made even more friends like that.\n\nAt 30, person B also has a net worth of 0 because they never saved. They have multiple close friends, and have experienced many cool things in life. They are making $40,000 a year. They also have $30,000 in expenses.\n\nNow, they meet each other, fall in love, and move in together. Let's say that their combined expenses would now be $50,000. If they split expenses based on income, person A would pay $39,500 ($9,500 **more** than they used to pay when they were single) and person B would pay $10,500 ($19,500 **less** than they used to pay when they were single).\n\nI think that's unfair. The only reason person B is earning less is because of the **choices** they made in the past. It's not because they were unlucky or something. Person A sacrificed many things during their twenties, expecting it would pay off later. Effectively, person A is giving away to person B the results of half the sacrifices they made (and are continuing to make since they still hate their job), while person B had to make no sacrifices.\n\nNow maybe both of them are fully aware about it, and they are fine with it, then perfect. Maybe person B makes up for it in other ways, or maybe person A just doesn't care and is happy to share the sacrifices they made with their loved one. But people who say \"it's only fair\" are wrong. It's not fair.\n\nI just used an extreme example to illustrate my point. Even if the difference is smaller, the point still stands. If person A was earning only 10% more than because they made 10% more sacrifices, it would still be unfair for them to cover 10% more of the expenses.", "authorship": "human"}

I ended up getting one and I have had it for a few years and I feel qualified to make this judgement. \n\nThis isn't like a lot of social media hyped products, it does work the way the company describes.

Other than that, the money clip works like you would expect, and the device itself has no problem holding credit cards and licenses. The longevity of the elastic will almost certainly not last as long as leather but it has held up fine in my testing. \n\nNow to the bad, it is annoying to get individual cards out. With a leather wallet that has traditional sleeves, removing the intended card was super easy, barely an inconvenience. With ridge, it is more annoying, in particular if the card is not at one end or the other. Leather wallets form to the space they are in, whether they are in your back pocket, front pocket, breast pocket, whatever. The ridge is a solid square. The ridge wallet damages credit cards on their corners. The ridge wallet also scratches whatever else it comes into contact with in your pocket or other carrying device. So you have your key fob for your car, wallet, and phone. Now my keys go in my back pocket, and I have to remove them to sit down. This was never an issue with a leather wallet. \n\nTLDR; The ridge wallet is true to its claims, even so, it is still inferior to a leather wallet in ways that are important to me.
