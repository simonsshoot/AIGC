We innovatively partition the provenance graph into two distinct components, the graph structure and attribute, and store them separately. Based on their respective characteristics, we devise two appropriate storage schemes: the provenance graph structure storage method based on machine learning and the use of the minimal spanning tree to store the graph attributes. Compared with the state-of-the-art approach, LEONARD, LESS reduces 6.29 times in storage time, while also achieving a 5.24 times reduction in disk usage and an 18.3 times faster query speed while using only 11.5% of the memory on DARPA TC dataset. △ Less"}

Blakely", "pdf_link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15672.pdf", "abstract": "Cyberattacks are becoming increasingly difficult to detect and prevent due to their sophistication. In response, Autonomous Intelligent Cyber-defense Agents (AICAs) are emerging as crucial solutions. One prominent AICA agent is the Intrusion Response System (IRS), which is critical for mitigating threats after detection . IRS uses several Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to mitigate attacks and restore the infrastructure to normal operations. Continuous monitoring of the enterprise infrastructure is an essential TTP the IRS uses. However, each system serves different purposes to meet operational needs. Integrating these disparate sources for continuous monitoring increases pre-processing complexity and limits automation, eventually prolonging critical response time for attackers to exploit. We propose a unified IRS Knowledge Graph ontology (IRSKG) that streamlines the onboarding of new enterprise systems as a source for the AICAs. Our ontology can capture system monitoring logs and supplemental data, such as a rules repository containing the administrator-defined policies to dictate the IRS responses. Besides, our ontology permits us to incorporate dynamic changes to adapt to the evolving cyber-threat landscape. This robust yet concise design allows machine learning models to train effectively and recover a compromised system to its desired state autonomously with explainability. △ Less"}

Attackers exploit security vulnerabilities in internal networks or IoT devices, expanding their control after initial infiltration to steal sensitive data or carry out other malicious activities, posing a serious threat to system security.

In this regard, we analyze host authentication log data from a graph perspective and propose a multi-scale lateral movement detection framework called LMDetect. The main workflow of this framework proceeds as follows: 1) Construct a heterogeneous multigraph from host authentication log data to strengthen the correlations among internal system entities; 2) Design a time-aware subgraph generator to extract subgraphs centered on authentication events from the heterogeneous authentication multigraph; 3) Design a multi-scale attention encoder that leverages both local and global attention to capture hidden anomalous behavior patterns in the authentication subgraphs, thereby achieving lateral movement detection . Extensive experiments on two real-world authentication log datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework in detecting lateral movement behaviors. △ Less"}

This evolution exposes several critical issues: (1) The dense interaction between malicious and benign nodes within provenance graphs introduces neighbor noise, hindering effective detection ; (2) The complex prediction mechanisms of existing APTs detection models lead to the insufficient utilization of prior knowledge embedded in the data; (3) The high computational cost makes detection impractical. To address these challenges, we propose Winemaking, a lightweight threat detection system built on a knowledge distillation framework, capable of node-level detection within audit log provenance graphs. Specifically, Winemaking applies graph Laplacian regularization to reduce neighbor noise, obtaining smoothed and denoised graph signals. Subsequently, Winemaking employs a teacher model based on GNNs to extract knowledge, which is then distilled into a lightweight student model. The student model is designed as a trainable combination of a feature transformation module and a personalized PageRank random walk label propagation module, with the former capturing feature knowledge and the latter learning label and structural knowledge.

The time window aggregates information with respect to hosts facilitating the identification of flow signatures that are missed by other aggregation methods. Several network architectures are studied and the use of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)-inspired trainable activation functions that help to achieve higher accuracy with simpler network structure is proposed. The reported training accuracy exceeds 99% for the proposed method with as little as twenty neural network input features. This work also studies the generalization capability of NIDS, a crucial aspect that has not been adequately addressed in the previous studies. The generalization experiments are conducted using CICIDS2017 dataset and a custom dataset collected as part of this study. It is shown that the performance metrics decline significantly when changing datasets, and the reduction in performance metrics can be attributed to the difference in signatures of the same type flows in different datasets, which in turn can be attributed to the differences between the underlying networks.

Modern attacks incorporate a wide range of attack vectors, from social engineering to signal injection. The security community is addressing these challenges using a growing set of fragmented defenses. Regardless of the vector of a USB-based attack, the most important risks concerning most people and enterprises are service crashes and data loss. The host OS manages USB peripherals, and malicious USB peripherals, such as those infected with BadUSB, can crash a service or steal data from the OS. Although USB firewalls have been proposed to thwart malicious USB peripherals, such as USBFilter and USBGuard, they cannot prevent real-world intrusions . This paper focuses on building a security framework called USBIPS within OSs to defend against malicious USB peripherals. This includes major efforts to explore the nature of malicious behavior and build persistent protection from USB-based intrusions . We first present a behavior-based detection mechanism focusing on attacks integrated into USB peripherals. We then introduce the novel idea of an allowlisting-based method for USB access control. We finally develop endpoint detection and response system to build the first generic security framework that thwarts USB-based intrusion . Within a centralized threat analysis framework, it provides persistent protection and may detect unknown malicious behavior. By addressing key security and performance challenges, these efforts help modern OSs against attacks from untrusted USB peripherals. △ Less"}

Moreover, TEAM leverages Time Dilation (TD) to effectively mitigates the effect of temporal among adversarial examples within the same time steps. Experimental results show that in most attack categories, TEAM improves the misjudgment rate of NIDS on both black and white boxes, making the misjudgment rate reach more than 96.68%.

This paper introduces the notion of feature perturb-ability and presents a novel Perturb-ability Score (PS) metric that identifies NIDS features susceptible to manipulation in the problem-space by an attacker. By quantifying a feature's susceptibility to perturbations within the problem-space, the PS facilitates the selection of features that are inherently more robust against evasion adversarial attacks on ML-NIDS during the feature selection phase. These features exhibit natural resilience to perturbations, as they are heavily constrained by the problem-space limitations and correlations of the NIDS domain. Furthermore, manipulating these features may either disrupt the malicious function of evasion adversarial attacks on NIDS or render the network traffic invalid for processing (or both). This proposed novel approach employs a fresh angle by leveraging network domain constraints as a defense mechanism against problem-space evasion adversarial attacks targeting ML-NIDS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our PS-guided feature selection defense in enhancing NIDS robustness. Experimental results across various ML-based NIDS models and public datasets show that selecting only robust features (low-PS features) can maintain solid detection performance while significantly reducing vulnerability to evasion adversarial attacks. Additionally, our findings verify that the PS effectively identifies NIDS features highly vulnerable to problem-space perturbations. △ Less"}

However, LCDRs are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Fault-Masking Attacks (FMAs) are stealthy cyberattacks performed by manipulating the remote measurements of the targeted LCDR to disguise faults on the protected line. Hence, they remain undetected by this LCDR. In this paper, we propose a two-module framework to detect FMAs. The first module is a Mismatch Index (MI) developed from the protected transmission line's equivalent physical model. The MI is triggered only if there is a significant mismatch in the LCDR's local and remote measurements while the LCDR itself is untriggered, which indicates an FMA. After the MI is triggered, the second module, a neural network-based classifier, promptly confirms that the triggering event is a physical fault that lies on the line protected by the LCDR before declaring the occurrence of an FMA. The proposed framework is tested using the IEEE 39-bus benchmark system . Our simulation results confirm that the proposed framework can accurately detect FMAs on LCDRs and is not affected by normal system disturbances, variations, or measurement noise.

A great deal of research has been done within the field of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in these networks. Yet, numerous approaches still rely on deep learning algorithms. These algorithms suffer from complexity in implementation, high processing power and high memory consumption. In addition to security issues, firstly, the number of datasets that are based on SDN protocols are very small. Secondly, the ones that are available encompass numerous attacks in the network and do not focus on a single attack. For this reason, to introduce an SDN-based IDS with a focus on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, it is necessary to generate a DDoS-oriented dataset whose features can train a high-quality IDS. In this work, in order to address two important challenges in SDNs, initially, we generate three DDoS attack datasets based on three common and different network topologies. In the second step, using the Convolutional Tsetlin Machine (CTM), we introduce a lightweight IDS for DDoS attack dubbed CTMBIDS. The lightweight nature of the CTMBIDS stems from its low memory consumption and also its interpretability compared to the existing complex deep learning models. The low usage of system resources for the CTMBIDS makes it an ideal choice for an optimal software that consumes the SDN controllers least amount of memory. Also, in order to ascertain the quality of the generated datasets, we compare the CTMBIDS empirical results with the DDoS attacks of the KDDCup99 benchmark dataset as well. Since the main focus of this work is on a lightweight IDS, the results show the CTMBIDS performs much more efficiently than deep learning based approaches. Furthermore, the results also show in most datasets, the proposed method has relatively equal or better accuracy and also consumes much less memory than the existing methods. △ Less"}

However, the increased complexity and automation of these networks have also escalated cybersecurity risks. Existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) leveraging traditional Machine Learning (ML) techniques have shown effectiveness in mitigating these risks, but they often require extensive manual effort and expert knowledge. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)-based autonomous IDS framework towards achieving autonomous cybersecurity for next-generation networks. To achieve autonomous intrusion detection , the proposed AutoML framework automates all critical procedures of the data analytics pipeline, including data pre-processing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model ensemble. Specifically, it utilizes a Tabular Variational Auto-Encoder (TVAE) method for automated data balancing, tree-based ML models for automated feature selection and base model learning, Bayesian Optimization (BO) for hyperparameter optimization, and a novel Optimized Confidence-based Stacking Ensemble (OCSE) method for automated model ensemble. The proposed AutoML-based IDS was evaluated on two public benchmark network security datasets, CICIDS2017 and 5G-NIDD, and demonstrated improved performance compared to state-of-the-art cybersecurity methods.

In this work, we present SDOoop, which extends the capabilities of SDO's streaming version to retain temporal information of data structures. SDOoop spots contextual anomalies undetectable by traditional algorithms, while enabling the inspection of data geometries, clusters and temporal patterns. We used SDOoop to model real network communications in critical infrastructures and extract patterns that disclose their dynamics. Moreover, we evaluated SDOoop with data from intrusion detection and natural science domains and obtained performances equivalent or superior to state-of-the-art approaches. Our results show the high potential of new model-based methods to analyze and explain streaming data.

While previous studies have focused on IMUs positioned on the lower limbs, ear-worn IMUs offer a unique advantage in capturing gait dynamics with minimal intrusion . To address the challenges of gait cycle segmentation using short sequences, we introduce the Gait Characteristic Curve Regression and Restoration (GCCRR) method, a novel two-stage approach designed for fine-grained gait phase segmentation. The first stage transforms the segmentation task into a regression task on the Gait Characteristic Curve (GCC), which is a one-dimensional feature sequence incorporating periodic information. The second stage restores the gait cycle using peak detection techniques. Our method employs Bi-LSTM-based deep learning algorithms for regression to ensure reliable segmentation for short gait sequences. Evaluation on the HamlynGait dataset demonstrates that GCCRR achieves over 80\\% Accuracy, with a Timestamp Error below one sampling interval. Despite its promising results, the performance lags behind methods using more extensive sensor systems , highlighting the need for larger, more diverse datasets.

We constructed a hardware-in-the-loop simulator with ARINC 429 buses, explored these vulnerabilities, and identified their potential to deny, degrade, or disrupt aircraft capabilities. We performed a denial-of-service attack against a multi-function display via a compromised ARINC 429 bus using commercially available tools, which succeeded in disabling important navigational aids. This proven attack on physical avionics illustrates the risk inherent in ARINC 429 and the need for the ability to detect these attacks.

Machine learning-based attack classification offers a promising solution, as these models can be continuously updated with new data, enhancing the effectiveness of network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Unlike binary classification models that simply indicate the presence of an attack, multi-class models can identify specific types of attacks, allowing for more targeted and effective incident responses. However, a significant drawback of these classification models is their sensitivity to imbalanced training data. Recent advances suggest that generative models can assist in data augmentation, claiming to offer superior solutions for imbalanced datasets. Classical balancing methods, although less novel, also provide potential remedies for this issue. Despite these claims, a comprehensive comparison of these methods within the NIDS domain is lacking. Most existing studies focus narrowly on individual methods, making it difficult to compare results due to varying experimental setups. To close this gap, we designed a systematic framework to compare classical and generative resampling methods for class balancing across multiple popular classification models in the NIDS domain, evaluated on several NIDS benchmark datasets. Our experiments indicate that resampling methods for balancing training data do not reliably improve classification performance. Although some instances show performance improvements, the majority of results indicate decreased performance, with no consistent trend in favor of a specific resampling technique enhancing a particular classifier. △ Less"}

Alert-driven attack graphs (AGs) have been developed to reduce alert fatigue by automatically discovering attack paths in intrusion alerts. However, they only work in offline settings and cannot prioritize critical attack paths. This paper builds an action forecasting capability on top of the existing alert-driven AG framework for predicting the next likely attacker action given a sequence of observed actions, thus enabling analysts to prioritize non-trivial attack paths. We also modify the framework to build AGs in real time, as new alerts are triggered. This way, we convert alert-driven AGs into an early warning system that enables analysts to circumvent ongoing attacks and break the cyber killchain. We propose an expectation maximization approach to forecast future actions in a reversed suffix-based probabilistic deterministic finite automaton (rSPDFA). By utilizing three real-world intrusion and endpoint alert datasets, we empirically demonstrate that the best performing rSPDFA achieves an average top-3 accuracy of 67.27%, which reflects a 57.17% improvement over three baselines, on average.

However, the CAN bus lacks basic security measures such as authentication and encryption, making it highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. To ensure in-vehicle security, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) must detect seen attacks and provide a robust defense against new, unseen attacks while remaining lightweight for practical deployment. Previous work has relied solely on the CAN ID feature or has used traditional machine learning (ML) approaches with manual feature extraction. These approaches overlook other exploitable features, making it challenging to adapt to new unseen attack variants and compromising security. This paper introduces a cutting-edge, novel, lightweight, in-vehicle, IDS-leveraging, deep learning (DL) algorithm to address these limitations. The proposed IDS employs a multi-stage approach: an artificial neural network (ANN) in the first stage to detect seen attacks, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder in the second stage to detect new, unseen attacks. To understand and analyze diverse driving behaviors, update the model with the latest attack patterns, and preserve data privacy, we propose a theoretical framework to deploy our IDS in a hierarchical federated learning (H-FL) environment. Experimental results demonstrate that our IDS achieves an F1-score exceeding 0.99 for seen attacks and exceeding 0.95 for novel attacks, with a detection rate of 99.99%. Additionally, the false alarm rate (FAR) is exceptionally low at 0.016%, minimizing false alarms. Despite using DL algorithms known for their effectiveness in identifying sophisticated and zero-day attacks, the IDS remains lightweight, ensuring its feasibility for real-world deployment. △ Less"}

This has prompted ongoing research in Machine Learning (ML)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for cyber-attack classification. Traditional ML models require data transmission from IoT devices to a centralized server for traffic analysis, raising severe privacy concerns. To address this issue, researchers have studied Federated Learning (FL)-based IDSs that train models across IoT devices while keeping their data localized. However, the heterogeneity of data, stemming from distinct vulnerabilities of devices and complexity of attack vectors, poses a significant challenge to the effectiveness of FL models. While current research focuses on adapting various ML models within the FL framework, they fail to effectively address the issue of attack class imbalance among devices, which significantly degrades the classification accuracy of minority attacks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce FedMADE, a novel dynamic aggregation method, which clusters devices by their traffic patterns and aggregates local models based on their contributions towards overall performance. We evaluate FedMADE against other FL algorithms designed for non-IID data and observe up to 71.07% improvement in minority attack classification accuracy. We further show that FedMADE is robust to poisoning attacks and incurs only a 4.7% (5.03 seconds) latency overhead in each communication round compared to FedAvg, without increasing the computational load of IoT devices. △ Less"}

Moore", "pdf_link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05427.pdf", "abstract": "Modern vehicles rely on a myriad of electronic control units (ECUs) interconnected via controller area networks (CANs) for critical operations. Despite their ubiquitous use and reliability, CANs are susceptible to sophisticated cyberattacks, particularly masquerade attacks, which inject false data that mimic legitimate messages at the expected frequency. These attacks pose severe risks such as unintended acceleration, brake deactivation, and rogue steering. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often struggle to detect these subtle intrusions due to their seamless integration into normal traffic. This paper introduces a novel framework for detecting masquerade attacks in the CAN bus using graph machine learning (ML). We hypothesize that the integration of shallow graph embeddings with time series features derived from CAN frames enhances the detection of masquerade attacks. We show that by representing CAN bus frames as message sequence graphs (MSGs) and enriching each node with contextual statistical attributes from time series, we can enhance detection capabilities across various attack patterns compared to using only graph-based features. Our method ensures a comprehensive and dynamic analysis of CAN frame interactions, improving robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments on the ROAD dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in the detection rates of masquerade attacks compared to a baseline that uses only graph-based features, as confirmed by Mann-Whitney U and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests (p < 0.05). △ Less"}

Machine learning has emerged as a popular approach for intrusion detection due to its ability to analyze and detect patterns in large volumes of data. However, current ML-based IDS solutions often struggle to keep pace with the ever-changing nature of attack patterns and the emergence of new attack types. Additionally, these solutions face challenges related to class imbalance, where the number of instances belonging to different classes (normal and intrusions ) is significantly imbalanced, which hinders their ability to effectively detect minor classes. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) architecture, enabling automatic, efficient, and robust network intrusion detection . To enhance the capabilities of the proposed model, we have improved the DQN algorithm by implementing the weighted mean square loss function and employing cost-sensitive learning techniques. Our solution introduces a resilient architecture designed to accommodate the addition of new attacks and effectively adapt to changes in existing attack patterns. Experimental results realized using CIC-IDS-2017 dataset, demonstrate that our approach can effectively handle the class imbalance problem and provide a fine grained classification of attacks with a very low false positive rate.

A significant challenge arises when EVs intentionally provide false information to gain higher charging priority, potentially causing grid instability. While various approaches have been proposed in existing literature to address this issue, they often overlook the possibility of attackers using advanced techniques like deep reinforcement learning (DRL) or other complex deep learning methods to achieve such attacks. In response to this, this paper introduces a hierarchical adversarial framework using DRL (HADRL), which effectively detects stealthy cyberattacks on EV charging stations, especially those leading to denial of charging. Our approach includes a dual approach, where the first scheme leverages DRL to develop advanced and stealthy attack methods that can bypass basic intrusion detection systems (IDS). Second, we implement a DRL-based scheme within the IDS at EV charging stations, aiming to detect and counter these sophisticated attacks. This scheme is trained with datasets created from the first scheme, resulting in a robust and efficient IDS. We evaluated the effectiveness of our framework against the recent literature approaches, and the results show that our IDS can accurately detect deceptive EVs with a low false alarm rate, even when confronted with attacks not represented in the training dataset. △ Less"}

However, the main limitation of such solutions is their inability to detect attacks different from those seen during the training phase, or new attacks, also called zero-day attacks. Moreover, training the detection model requires significant data collection and labeling, which increases the communication overhead, and raises privacy concerns. To address the aforementioned limits, we propose in this paper a novel detection mechanism that leverages the ability of the deep auto-encoder method to detect attacks relying only on the benign network traffic pattern.

Nevertheless, as connectivity expands, cybersecurity threats have become a significant concern. The issue has been further exacerbated by the rising number of zero-day (0-day) attacks, which can exploit unknown vulnerabilities and bypass existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs).

For this security paradigm to be fully realized, it necessitates the active participation of small-scale power suppliers (SPSs) in implementing honeypots and engaging in collaborative data sharing with traditional power retailers (TPRs). To motivate this interaction, TPRs incentivize data sharing with tangible rewards. However, without access to an SPS's confidential data, it is daunting for TPRs to validate shared data, thereby risking SPSs' privacy and increasing sharing costs due to voluminous honeypot logs. These challenges can be resolved by utilizing Federated Learning (FL), a distributed machine learning (ML) technique that allows for model training without data relocation. However, the conventional FL algorithm lacks the requisite functionality for both the security defense model and the rewards system of the AMI network. This work presents two solutions: first, an enhanced and cost-efficient FedAvg algorithm incorporating a novel data quality measure, and second, FedPot, the development of an effective security model with a fair incentives mechanism under an FL architecture. Accordingly, SPSs are limited to sharing the ML model they learn after efficiently measuring their local data quality, whereas TPRs can verify the participants' uploaded models and fairly compensate each participant for their contributions through rewards. Simulation results, drawn from realistic mircorgrid network log datasets, demonstrate that the proposed solutions outperform state-of-the-art techniques by enhancing the security model and guaranteeing fair reward distributions. △ Less"}

Over the past decade, many universities and organizations have adopted this model for their research computing.

We strive to answer the following research questions in this study: Does a Science DMZ exhibit significantly different behavior than a general-purpose campus network? Does it improve application performance compared to such general-purpose networks? Through a two-year-long quantitative network measurement study, we find that a Science DMZ exhibits lower latency, higher throughput, and lower jitter behaviors. However, we also see several non-intuitive results. For example, a DMZ may take a longer route to external destinations and experience higher latency than the campus network. While the DMZ model benefits researchers, the benefits are not automatic - careful network tuning based on specific use cases is required to realize the full potential of such infrastructure. △ Less"}

As masquerade attacks could seriously harm vehicle functionality and are the stealthiest attacks to detect in CAN, recent work has devoted attention to compare frameworks for detecting masquerade attacks in CAN. However, most existing works report offline evaluations using CAN logs already collected using simulations that do not comply with domain's real-time constraints. Here we contribute to advance the state of the art by introducing a benchmark study of four different non-deep learning (DL)-based unsupervised online intrusion detection systems (IDS) for masquerade attacks in CAN. Our approach differs from existing benchmarks in that we analyze the effect of controlling streaming data conditions in a sliding window setting. In doing so, we use realistic masquerade attacks being replayed from the ROAD dataset. We show that although benchmarked IDS are not effective at detecting every attack type, the method that relies on detecting changes at the hierarchical structure of clusters of time series produces the best results at the expense of higher computational overhead. We discuss limitations, open challenges, and how the benchmarked methods can be used for practical unsupervised online CAN IDS for masquerade attacks. △ Less"}

However, since the number of features to describe the network connections is often large, where some features are redundant or noisy, feature selection is necessary in such scenarios, which can both improve the efficiency and accuracy. Recently, some researchers focus on using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to select features. But usually, they only consider the number of features and classification accuracy as the objectives, resulting in unsatisfactory performance on a critical metric, detection rate. This will lead to the missing of many real attacks and bring huge losses to the network system . In this paper, we propose DR-MOFS to model the feature selection problem in network intrusion detection as a three-objective optimization problem, where the number of features, accuracy and detection rate are optimized simultaneously, and use MOEAs to solve it.

This type of monitoring is highly intrusive , as it involves examining the content of data packets, which can include personal and sensitive information. Such data scrutiny is often governed by stringent laws and regulations, especially in environments like smart homes where data privacy is paramount. Synthetic data offers a promising solution by mimicking real network behavior without revealing sensitive details. Generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can produce synthetic data, but they often struggle to generate realistic data in specialized domains like network activity. This limitation stems from insufficient training data, which impedes the model's ability to grasp the domain's rules and constraints adequately. Moreover, the scarcity of training data exacerbates the problem of class imbalance in intrusion detection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Driven framework that utilizes a knowledge-infused Generative Adversarial Network for generating synthetic network activity data (KiNETGAN). This approach enhances the resilience of distributed intrusion detection while addressing privacy concerns.

However, the data heterogeneity across participating domains and entities presents significant challenges for the reliable implementation of an FL-based IDS. In this paper, we propose an effective method called Statistical Averaging (StatAvg) to alleviate non-independently and identically (non-iid) distributed features across local clients' data in FL. In particular, StatAvg allows the FL clients to share their individual data statistics with the server, which then aggregates this information to produce global statistics.

Additionally, we introduce a pipeline for extracting clinically relevant features from eye-gaze analysis, describing the capabilities of the proposed system from a medical perspective. The study involved a cohort of healthy control individuals and patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, showcasing the feasibility and potential of the proposed technology for non- intrusive monitoring of eye movement patterns for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical relevance - Developing a non-invasive biomarker for Parkinson's disease is urgently needed to accurately detect the disease's onset. This would allow for the timely introduction of neuroprotective treatment at the earliest stage and enable the continuous monitoring of intervention outcomes. The ability to detect subtle changes in eye movements allows for early diagnosis, offering a critical window for intervention before more pronounced symptoms emerge. Eye tracking provides objective and quantifiable biomarkers, ensuring reliable assessments of disease progression and cognitive function. The eye gaze analysis using Mixed Reality glasses is wireless, facilitating convenient assessments in both home and hospital settings. The approach offers the advantage of utilizing hardware that requires no additional specialized attachments, enabling examinations through personal eyewear. △ Less"}

Their task is to detect anomalies in network communication and identify, if not thwart, possibly malicious behavior. Recently, machine learning has been deployed to construct intelligent IDS. This approach, however, is quite challenging particularly in distributed, highly dynamic, yet resource-constrained systems like Edge setups. In this paper, we tackle this issue from multiple angles by analyzing the concept of intelligent IDS (I-IDS) while addressing the specific requirements of Edge devices with a special focus on reconfigurability. Then, we introduce a systematic approach to constructing the I-IDS on reconfigurable Edge hardware. For this, we implemented our proposed IDS on state-of-the-art Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) technology as (1) a purely FPGA-based dataflow processor (DFP) and (2) a co-designed approach featuring RISC-V soft-core as FPGA-based soft-core processor (SCP). We complete our paper with a comparison of the state of the art (SoA) in this domain. The results show that DFP and SCP are both suitable for Edge applications from hardware resource and energy efficiency perspectives. Our proposed DFP solution clearly outperforms the SoA and demonstrates that required high performance can be achieved without prohibitively high hardware costs. This makes our proposed DFP suitable for Edge-based high-speed applications like modern communication technology. △ Less"}

In this research, a novel approach for enhancing the performance of an NIDS through the integration of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is proposed. By harnessing the power of GANs in generating synthetic network traffic data that closely mimics real-world network behavior, we address a key challenge associated with NIDS training datasets, which is the data scarcity. Three distinct GAN models (Vanilla GAN, Wasserstein GAN and Conditional Tabular GAN) are implemented in this work to generate authentic network traffic patterns specifically tailored to represent the anomalous activity. We demonstrate how this synthetic data resampling technique can significantly improve the performance of the NIDS model for detecting such activity. By conducting comprehensive experiments using the CIC-IDS2017 benchmark dataset, augmented with GAN-generated data, we offer empirical evidence that shows the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

In this paper, we propose Genos, a general in-network framework for unsupervised A-NIDS by rule extraction, which consists of a Model Compiler, a Model Interpreter, and a Model Debugger. Specifically, observing benign data are multimodal and usually located in multiple subspaces in the feature space, we utilize a divide-and-conquer approach for model-agnostic rule extraction.

The Model Interpreter interprets predictions by important attributes to aid network operators in understanding the predictions. The Model Debugger conducts incremental updating to rectify errors by only fine-tuning rules on affected subspaces, thus reducing maintenance costs.

Deep learning techniques have shown great potential in DPI for IDSs due to their efficiency in learning intricate patterns from the packet content being transmitted through the network. In this paper, we propose a revolutionary DPI algorithm based on transformers adapted for the purpose of detecting malicious traffic with a classifier head.

Besides, anomalous traffic in real networks accounts for only a small fraction, which leads to a severe imbalance problem in the dataset that makes algorithmic learning and prediction extremely difficult.

This also leads to potentially redundant/noisy features that may decrease the accuracy of the detection engine in IDSs. This paper first introduces a novel neural network architecture called Multiple-Input Auto-Encoder (MIAE). MIAE consists of multiple sub-encoders that can process inputs from different sources with different characteristics. The MIAE model is trained in an unsupervised learning mode to transform the heterogeneous inputs into lower-dimensional representation, which helps classifiers distinguish between normal behaviour and different types of attacks. To distil and retain more relevant features but remove less important/redundant ones during the training process, we further design and embed a feature selection layer right after the representation layer of MIAE resulting in a new model called MIAEFS. This layer learns the importance of features in the representation vector, facilitating the selection of informative features from the representation vector. The results on three IDS datasets, i.e., NSLKDD, UNSW-NB15, and IDS2017, show the superior performance of MIAE and MIAEFS compared to other methods, e.g., conventional classifiers, dimensionality reduction models, unsupervised representation learning methods with different input dimensions, and unsupervised feature selection models. Moreover, MIAE and MIAEFS combined with the Random Forest (RF) classifier achieve accuracy of 96.5% in detecting sophisticated attacks, e.g., Slowloris.

To safeguard critical infrastructures from these emerging threats, it is crucial to deploy an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that can detect different types of attacks accurately while minimizing false alarms. Machine learning approaches have been used extensively in IDS and they are mainly using flat multi-class classification to differentiate normal traffic and different types of attacks. Though cyberattack types exhibit a hierarchical structure where similar granular attack subtypes can be grouped into more high-level attack types, hierarchical classification approach has not been explored well. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of hierarchical classification approach in IDS. We use a three-level hierarchical classification model to classify various network attacks, where the first level classifies benign or attack, the second level classifies coarse high-level attack types, and the third level classifies a granular level attack types. Our empirical results of using 10 different classification algorithms in 10 different datasets show that there is no significant difference in terms of overall classification performance (i.e., detecting normal and different types of attack correctly) of hierarchical and flat classification approaches. However, flat classification approach misclassify attacks as normal whereas hierarchical approach misclassify one type of attack as another attack type. In other words, the hierarchical classification approach significantly minimises attacks from misclassified as normal traffic, which is more important in critical systems . △ Less"}

However, machine learning-based IDSs, when trained on specific attack patterns, often misclassify new emerging cyberattacks. Further, the limited availability of attack instances for training a supervised learner and the ever-evolving nature of cyber threats further complicate the matter. This emphasizes the need for an adaptable IDS framework capable of recognizing and learning from unfamiliar/unseen attacks over time. In this research, we propose a one-class classification-driven IDS system structured on two tiers. The first tier distinguishes between normal activities and attacks/threats, while the second tier determines if the detected attack is known or unknown. Within this second tier, we also embed a multi-classification mechanism coupled with a clustering algorithm. This model not only identifies unseen attacks but also uses them for retraining them by clustering unseen attacks. This enables our model to be future-proofed, capable of evolving with emerging threat patterns. Leveraging one-class classifiers (OCC) at the first level, our approach bypasses the need for attack samples, addressing data imbalance and zero-day attack concerns and OCC at the second level can effectively separate unknown attacks from the known attacks.

Our findings show the necessity of extensive malicious training data for supervised IIDSs, which can be impractical considering the complexity of recording and labeling attacks in actual industrial environments. Furthermore, while other IIDSs circumvent the previous issue by requiring only benign training data, these can suffer from the difficulty of setting appropriate hyperparameters, which likewise can diminish their performance. By shedding light on these challenges, we aim to enhance the understanding of the limitations and considerations necessary for deploying effective cybersecurity solutions in ICSs, which might be one reason why IIDSs see few deployments. △ Less"}

However, most present GNN-based methods for NIDS are supervised or semi-supervised. Network flows need to be manually annotated as supervisory labels, a process that is time-consuming or even impossible, making NIDS difficult to adapt to potentially complex attacks, especially in large-scale real-world scenarios. The existing GNN-based self-supervised methods focus on the binary classification of network flow as benign or not, and thus fail to reveal the types of attack in practice. This paper studies the application of GNNs to identify the specific types of network flows in an unsupervised manner. We first design an encoder to obtain graph embedding, that introduces the graph attention mechanism and considers the edge information as the only essential factor. Then, a self-supervised method based on graph contrastive learning is proposed. The method samples center nodes, and for each center node, generates subgraph by it and its direct neighbor nodes, and corresponding contrastive subgraph from the interpolated graph, and finally constructs positive and negative samples from subgraphs. Furthermore, a structured contrastive loss function based on edge features and graph local topology is introduced. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first GNN-based self-supervised method for the multiclass classification of network flows in NIDS. Detailed experiments conducted on four real-world databases (NF-Bot-IoT, NF-Bot-IoT-v2, NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, and NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018-v2) systematically compare our model with the state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised models, illustrating the considerable potential of our method.

One such issue is latency, where we find that even the latest embedded platforms from NVIDIA fail to execute intelligence tasks (e.g., object detection ) of autonomous vehicles in a real-time fashion. One remedy to this problem is the promising paradigm of edge computing. Through collaboration with our industry partner, we identify key prohibitive limitations of the current edge mindset: (1) servers are not distributed enough and thus, are not close enough to vehicles, (2) current proposed edge solutions do not provide substantially better performance and extra information specific to autonomous vehicles to warrant their cost to the user, and (3) the state-of-the-art solutions are not compatible with popular frameworks used in autonomous systems , particularly the Robot Operating System (ROS). To remedy these issues, we provide Genie, an encapsulation technique that can enable transparent caching in ROS in a non- intrusive way (i.e., without modifying the source code), can build the cache in a distributed manner (in contrast to traditional central caching methods), and can construct a collective three-dimensional object map to provide substantially better latency (even on low-power edge servers) and higher quality data to all vehicles in a certain locality. We fully implement our design on state-of-the-art industry-adopted embedded and edge platforms, using the prominent autonomous driving software Autoware, and find that Genie can enhance the latency of Autoware Vision Detector by 82% on average, enable object reusability 31% of the time on average and as much as 67% for the incoming requests, and boost the confidence in its object map considerably over time. △ Less"}

In contrast to most related research, we have abundant data to train the models and evaluate their predictive power. The data comes from traces we generate on an in-house testbed where we run attacks against an emulated IT infrastructure. Central to our work is a machine-learning pipeline that maps measurements from a high-dimensional observation space to a space of low dimensionality or to a small set of observation symbols. Investigating intrusions in offline as well as online scenarios, we find that both HMM and LSTM can be effective in predicting attack start time, attack type, and attack actions.

In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis on the generalization of machine-learning-based NIDS through an extensive experimentation in a cross-dataset framework. We employ four machine learning classifiers and utilize four datasets acquired from different networks: CIC-IDS-2017, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, LycoS-IDS2017, and LycoS-Unicas-IDS2018. Notably, the last dataset is a novel contribution, where we apply corrections based on LycoS-IDS2017 to the well-known CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset. The results show nearly perfect classification performance when the models are trained and tested on the same dataset. However, when training and testing the models in a cross-dataset fashion, the classification accuracy is largely commensurate with random chance except for a few combinations of attacks and datasets. We employ data visualization techniques in order to provide valuable insights on the patterns in the data.

Maintaining network integrity and protecting the legitimate interests of users is at the heart of network construction. Threat detection is an important part of a complete and effective defense system . How to effectively detect unknown threats is one of the concerns of network protection. Currently, network threat detection is usually based on rules and traditional machine learning methods, which create artificial rules or extract common spatiotemporal features, which cannot be applied to large-scale data applications, and the emergence of unknown risks causes the detection accuracy of the original model to decline. With this in mind, this paper uses deep learning for advanced threat detection to improve protective measures in the financial industry. Many network researchers have shifted their focus to exception-based intrusion detection techniques.

A notable example of such a system is Snort, which compares network traffic against a series of rules that match known exploits. Current SIDS rules are designed to minimize the amount of legitimate traffic flagged incorrectly, reducing the burden on network administrators. However, different use cases than the traditional one--such as researchers studying trends or analyzing modified versions of known exploits--may require SIDSs to be less constrained in their operation. In this paper, we demonstrate that applying modifications to real-world SIDS rules allow for relaxing some constraints and characterizing the performance space of modified rules. We develop an iterative approach for exploring the space of modifications to SIDS rules. By taking the modifications that expand the ROC curve of performance and altering them further, we show how to modify rules in a directed manner. Using traffic collected and identified as benign or malicious from a cloud telescope, we find that the removal of a single component from SIDS rules has the largest impact on the performance space. Effectively modifying SIDS rules to reduce constraints can enable a broader range of detection for various objectives, from increased security to research purposes. △ Less"}

Although improving and comparing the detection capability is the focus of most research works, the timeliness of the detection is less considered and often insufficiently evaluated or discussed. In this paper, we argue the relevance of measuring the temporal latency of attacks and errors, and we propose an evaluation approach for detectors to ensure a pragmatic trade-off between correct and in-time detection . Briefly, the approach relates the false positive rate with the temporal latency of attacks and errors, and this ultimately leads to guidelines for configuring a detector. We apply our approach by evaluating different ED and ID solutions in two industrial cases: i) an embedded railway on-board system that optimizes public mobility, and ii) an edge device for the Industrial Internet of Things. Our results show that considering latency in addition to traditional metrics like the false positive rate, precision, and coverage gives an additional fundamental perspective on the actual performance of the detector and should be considered when assessing and configuring anomaly detectors. △ Less"}

We present a dataset for intrusion detection by performing penetration testing on an embedded cyber-physical system built over Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2). Features are monitored from three architectural layers: the Linux operating system , the network, and the ROS2 services. The dataset is structured as a time series and describes the expected behavior of the system and its response to ROS2-specific attacks: it repeatedly alternates periods of attack-free operation with periods when a specific attack is being performed.

In response to this challenge, we propose AOC-IDS, a novel online IDS that features an autonomous anomaly detection module (ADM) and a labor-free online framework for continual adaptation. In order to enhance data comprehension, the ADM employs an Autoencoder (AE) with a tailored Cluster Repelling Contrastive (CRC) loss function to generate distinctive representation from limited or incrementally incoming data in the online setting.

However, existing IDS approaches rely on centralized servers to generate behaviour profiles and detect anomalies, causing high response time and large operational costs due to communication overhead. Besides, sharing of behaviour data in an open and distributed IoT network environment may violate on-device privacy requirements. Additionally, various IoT devices tend to capture heterogeneous data, which complicates the training of behaviour models. In this paper, we introduce Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train a decentralized shared model of IDS, without exposing training data to others. Furthermore, we propose an effective method called Federated Learning Ensemble Knowledge Distillation (FLEKD) to mitigate the heterogeneity problems across various clients. FLEKD enables a more flexible aggregation method than conventional model fusion techniques. Experiment results on the public dataset CICIDS2019 demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms local training and traditional FL in terms of both speed and performance and significantly improves the system's ability to detect unknown attacks. Finally, we evaluate our proposed framework's performance in three potential real-world scenarios and show FLEKD has a clear advantage in experimental results. △ Less"}

However, the rising connectivity coupled with the legacy network architecture within vehicles can be exploited for launching active and passive attacks on critical vehicle systems and directly affecting the safety of passengers. Machine learning-based intrusion detection models have been shown to successfully detect multiple targeted attack vectors in recent literature, whose deployments are enabled through quantised neural networks targeting low-power platforms. Multiple models are often required to simultaneously detect multiple attack vectors, increasing the area, (resource) cost, and energy consumption. In this paper, we present a case for utilising custom-quantised MLP's (CQMLP) as a multi-class classification model, capable of detecting multiple attacks from the benign flow of controller area network (CAN) messages. The specific quantisation and neural architecture are determined through a joint design space exploration, resulting in our choice of the 2-bit precision and the n-layer MLP. Our 2-bit version is trained using Brevitas and optimised as a dataflow hardware model through the FINN toolflow from AMD/Xilinx, targeting an XCZU7EV device. We show that the 2-bit CQMLP model, when integrated as the IDS, can detect malicious attack messages (DoS, fuzzing, and spoofing attack) with a very high accuracy of 99.9%, on par with the state-of-the-art methods in the literature. Furthermore, the dataflow model can perform line rate detection at a latency of 0.11 ms from message reception while consuming 0.23 mJ/inference, making it ideally suited for integration with an ECU in critical CAN networks. △ Less"}

Attributes of CAN such as broadcast-based communication among electronic control units (ECUs) that lowered deployment costs are now being exploited to carry out active injection attacks like denial of service (DoS), fuzzing, and spoofing attacks. Research literature has proposed multiple supervised machine learning models deployed as Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to detect such malicious activity; however, these are largely limited to identifying previously known attack vectors. With the ever-increasing complexity of active injection attacks, detecting zero-day (novel) attacks in these networks in real-time (to prevent propagation) becomes a problem of particular interest. This paper presents an unsupervised-learning-based convolutional autoencoder architecture for detecting zero-day attacks, which is trained only on benign (attack-free) CAN messages. We quantise the model using Vitis-AI tools from AMD/Xilinx targeting a resource-constrained Zynq Ultrascale platform as our IDS-ECU system for integration. The proposed model successfully achieves equal or higher classification accuracy (> 99.5%) on unseen DoS, fuzzing, and spoofing attacks from a publicly available attack dataset when compared to the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning-based IDSs. Additionally, by cleverly overlapping IDS operation on a window of CAN messages with the reception, the model is able to meet line-rate detection (0.43 ms per window) of high-speed CAN, which when coupled with the low energy consumption per inference, makes this architecture ideally suited for detecting zero-day attacks on critical CAN networks. △ Less"}

White-box and black-box adversarial attacks of NIDS have been explored in several studies. However, white-box attacks unrealistically assume that the attackers have full knowledge of the target NIDSs. Meanwhile, existing black-box attacks can not achieve high attack success rate due to the weak adversarial transferability between models (e.g., neural networks and tree models). Additionally, neither of them explains why adversarial examples exist and why they can transfer across models. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ETA, an Explainable Transfer-based Black-Box Adversarial Attack framework. ETA aims to achieve two primary objectives: 1) create transferable adversarial examples applicable to various ML models and 2) provide insights into the existence of adversarial examples and their transferability within NIDSs. Specifically, we first provide a general transfer-based adversarial attack method applicable across the entire ML space. Following that, we exploit a unique insight based on cooperative game theory and perturbation interpretations to explain adversarial examples and adversarial transferability. On this basis, we propose an Important-Sensitive Feature Selection (ISFS) method to guide the search for adversarial examples, achieving stronger transferability and ensuring traffic-space constraints. △ Less"}

This increased access to in-vehicle functions compromises critical capabilities that use legacy invehicle networks like Controller Area Network (CAN), which has no inherent security or authentication mechanism. Intrusion detection and mitigation approaches, particularly using machine learning models, have shown promising results in detecting multiple attack vectors in CAN through their ability to generalise to new vectors. However, most deployments require dedicated computing units like GPUs to perform line-rate detection , consuming much higher power. In this paper, we present a lightweight multi-attack quantised machine learning model that is deployed using Xilinx's Deep Learning Processing Unit IP on a Zynq Ultrascale+ (XCZU3EG) FPGA, which is trained and validated using the public CAN Intrusion Detection dataset. The quantised model detects denial of service and fuzzing attacks with an accuracy of above 99 % and a false positive rate of 0.07%, which are comparable to the state-of-the-art techniques in the literature. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) execution consumes just 2.0 W with software tasks running on the ECU and achieves a 25 % reduction in per-message processing latency over the state-of-the-art implementations.

However, overfitting remains a challenge that affects the quality, reliability, and trustworthiness of software systems that utilize deep learning models. Overfitting can be (1) prevented (e.g., using dropout or early stopping) or (2) detected in a trained model (e.g., using correlation-based approaches). Both overfitting detection and prevention approaches that are currently used have constraints (e.g., requiring modification of the model structure, and high computing resources). In this paper, we propose a simple, yet powerful approach that can both detect and prevent overfitting based on the training history (i.e., validation losses). Our approach first trains a time series classifier on training histories of overfit models. This classifier is then used to detect if a trained model is overfit. In addition, our trained classifier can be used to prevent overfitting by identifying the optimal point to stop a model's training. We evaluate our approach on its ability to identify and prevent overfitting in real-world samples. We compare our approach against correlation-based detection approaches and the most commonly used prevention approach (i.e., early stopping). Our approach achieves an F1 score of 0.91 which is at least 5% higher than the current best-performing non- intrusive overfitting detection approach. Furthermore, our approach can stop training to avoid overfitting at least 32% of the times earlier than early stopping and has the same or a better rate of returning the best model. △ Less"}

While Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to enhance transparency, black box surrogate explainers, such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP), are difficult to trust. The black box nature of these surrogate explainers makes the process behind explanation generation opaque and difficult to understand. To avoid this problem, one can use transparent white box algorithms such as Rule Extraction (RE). There are three types of RE algorithms: pedagogical, decompositional, and eclectic. Pedagogical methods offer fast but untrustworthy white-box explanations, while decompositional RE provides trustworthy explanations with poor scalability. This work explores eclectic rule extraction, which strikes a balance between scalability and trustworthiness. By combining techniques from pedagogical and decompositional approaches, eclectic rule extraction leverages the advantages of both, while mitigating some of their drawbacks. The proposed Hybrid X-IDS architecture features eclectic RE as a white box surrogate explainer for black box Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The presented eclectic RE algorithm extracts human-readable rules from hidden layers, facilitating explainable and trustworthy rulesets. Evaluations on UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS-2017 datasets demonstrate the algorithm's ability to generate rulesets with 99.9% accuracy, mimicking DNN outputs. The contributions of this work include the hybrid X-IDS architecture, the eclectic rule extraction algorithm applicable to intrusion detection datasets, and a thorough analysis of performance and explainability, demonstrating the trade-offs involved in rule extraction speed and accuracy. △ Less"}

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are widely employed to detect network security threats. With vehicles' high mobility on the road and diverse environments, VANETs devise ever-changing network topologies, lack privacy and security, and have limited bandwidth efficiency. The absence of privacy precautions, End-to-End Encryption methods, and Local Data Processing systems in VANET also present many privacy and security difficulties. So, assessing whether a novel real-time processing IDS approach can be utilized for this emerging technology is crucial. The present study introduces a novel approach for intrusion detection using Federated Learning (FL) capabilities in conjunction with the BERT model for sequence classification (FL-BERT). The significance of data privacy is duly recognized. According to FL methodology, each client has its own local model and dataset. They train their models locally and then send the model's weights to the server. After aggregation, the server aggregates the weights from all clients to update a global model. After aggregation, the global model's weights are shared with the clients. This practice guarantees the secure storage of sensitive raw data on individual clients' devices, effectively protecting privacy. After conducting the federated learning procedure, we assessed our models' performance using a separate test dataset. The FL-BERT technique has yielded promising results, opening avenues for further investigation in this particular area of research. We reached the result of our approaches by comparing existing research works and found that FL-BERT is more effective for privacy and security concerns. Our results suggest that FL-BERT is a promising technique for enhancing attack detection . △ Less"}

For instance, US consumers lose billions of dollars annually due to various SE attacks. Unfortunately, generic social engineering attacks remain understudied, compared to other important threats, such as software vulnerabilities and exploitation, network intrusions , malicious software, and phishing. The few existing technical studies that focus on social engineering are limited in scope and mostly focus on measurements rather than developing a generic defense. To fill this gap, we present SEShield, a framework for in-browser detection of social engineering attacks. SEShield consists of three main components: (i) a custom security crawler, called SECrawler, that is dedicated to scouting the web to collect examples of in-the-wild SE attacks; (ii) SENet, a deep learning-based image classifier trained on data collected by SECrawler that aims to detect the often glaring visual traits of SE attack pages; and (iii) SEGuard, a proof-of-concept extension that embeds SENet into the web browser and enables real-time SE attack detection .

As a consequence, this paper unveils HeisenTrojan attacks, a new hardware attack that does not generate harmful hardware, but rather, exploits software vulnerabilities in the EDA tools themselves. A key feature of HeisenTrojan attacks is that they are capable of deploying a malicious payload on the system hosting the EDA tools without triggering verification tools because HeisenTrojan attacks do not rely on superfluous or malicious hardware that would otherwise be noticeable.

First, existing approaches assume that GUI screens are fixed so that they cannot be adapted to diverse systems with different screen conditions. Second, existing approaches use XY-plane robotic arms, which cannot flexibly simulate testing operations. Third, existing approaches ignore compatibility bugs and only focus on crash bugs.

However, FL is susceptible to poisoning attacks, in which the adversary injects manipulated model updates into the federated model aggregation process to corrupt or destroy predictions (untargeted poisoning) or implant hidden functionalities (targeted poisoning or backdoors). Existing defenses against poisoning attacks in FL have several limitations, such as relying on specific assumptions about attack types and strategies or data distributions or not sufficiently robust against advanced injection techniques and strategies and simultaneously maintaining the utility of the aggregated model. To address the deficiencies of existing defenses, we take a generic and completely different approach to detect poisoning (targeted and untargeted) attacks. We present FreqFed, a novel aggregation mechanism that transforms the model updates (i.e., weights) into the frequency domain, where we can identify the core frequency components that inherit sufficient information about weights. This allows us to effectively filter out malicious updates during local training on the clients, regardless of attack types, strategies, and clients' data distributions. We extensively evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of FreqFed in different application domains, including image classification, word prediction, IoT intrusion detection , and speech recognition. We demonstrate that FreqFed can mitigate poisoning attacks effectively with a negligible impact on the utility of the aggregated model. △ Less"}

Previous studies predominantly focused on centralized intrusion detection , assuming a central entity responsible for storing and analyzing data from all devices.However, these approaches face challenges including computation and storage costs, along with a single point of failure risk, threatening data privacy and availability. The widespread dispersion of data across interconnected devices underscores the necessity for decentralized approaches. This paper introduces the Federated Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (FL-IDS), addressing challenges encountered by centralized systems in FANETs. FL-IDS reduces computation and storage costs for both clients and the central server, crucial for resource-constrained UAVs. Operating in a decentralized manner, FL-IDS enables UAVs to collaboratively train a global intrusion detection model without sharing raw data, thus avoiding the delay in decisions based on collected data, as is often the case with traditional methods. Experimental results demonstrate FL-IDS's competitive performance with Central IDS (C-IDS) while mitigating privacy concerns, with the Bias Towards Specific Clients (BTSC) method further enhancing FL-IDS performance even at lower attacker ratios. Comparative analysis with traditional intrusion detection methods, including Local IDS (L-IDS), sheds light on FL-IDS's strengths. This study significantly contributes to UAV security by introducing a privacy-aware, decentralized intrusion detection approach tailored to UAV networks. Moreover, by introducing a realistic dataset for FANETs and federated learning, our approach differs from others lacking high dynamism and 3D node movements or accurate federated data federations. △ Less"}

However, due to the emergence and development of adversarial deep learning technologies, it becomes challenging for the adoption of DL models into IDS. In this paper, we propose a novel IDS architecture that can enhance the robustness of IDS against adversarial attacks by combining conventional machine learning (ML) models and Deep Learning models. The proposed DLL-IDS consists of three components: DL-based IDS, adversarial example (AE) detector, and ML-based IDS. We first develop a novel AE detector based on the local intrinsic dimensionality (LID). Then, we exploit the low attack transferability between DL models and ML models to find a robust ML model that can assist us in determining the maliciousness of AEs. If the input traffic is detected as an AE, the ML-based IDS will predict the maliciousness of input traffic, otherwise the DL-based IDS will work for the prediction. The fusion mechanism can leverage the high prediction accuracy of DL models and low attack transferability between DL models and ML models to improve the robustness of the whole system . In our experiments, we observe a significant improvement in the prediction performance of the IDS when subjected to adversarial attack, achieving high accuracy with low resource consumption. △ Less"}

Moreover, the deployment of IDSs on IoT systems is challenging, and sometimes impossible, due to the limited resources such as memory/storage and computing capability of typical IoT devices. To tackle these challenges, this article proposes a novel deep neural network/architecture called Constrained Twin Variational Auto-Encoder (CTVAE) that can feed classifiers of IDSs with more separable/distinguishable and lower-dimensional representation data. Additionally, in comparison to the state-of-the-art neural networks used in IDSs, CTVAE requires less memory/storage and computing power, hence making it more suitable for IoT IDS systems . Extensive experiments with the 11 most popular IoT botnet datasets show that CTVAE can boost around 1% in terms of accuracy and Fscore in detection attack compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning and representation learning methods, whilst the running time for attack detection is lower than 2E-6 seconds and the model size is lower than 1 MB.

However, these systems raise a vast number of alerts that must be analysed and triaged by security analysts. This process is largely manual, tedious and time-consuming. Alert correlation is a technique that tries to reduce the number of intrusion alerts by aggregating those that are related in some way. However, the correlation is performed outside the IDS through third-party systems and tools, after the high volume of alerts has already been raised. These other third-party systems add to the complexity of security operations. In this paper, we build on the very researched area of correlation techniques by developing a novel hierarchical event correlation model that promises to reduce the number of alerts issued by an Intrusion Detection System . This is achieved by correlating the events before the IDS classifies them. The proposed model takes the best of features from similarity and graph-based correlation techniques to deliver an ensemble capability not possible by either approach separately. Further, we propose a correlation process for correlation of events rather than alerts as is the case in current art. We further develop our own correlation and clustering algorithm which is tailor-made to the correlation and clustering of network event data. The model is implemented as a proof of concept with experiments run on the DARPA 99 Intrusion detection set.

While AD is typically treated as an unsupervised learning task due to the high cost of label annotation, it is more practical to assume access to a small set of labeled anomaly samples from domain experts, as is the case for semi-supervised anomaly detection . Semi-supervised and supervised approaches can leverage such labeled data, resulting in improved performance. In this paper, rather than proposing a new semi-supervised or supervised approach for AD, we introduce a novel algorithm for generating additional pseudo-anomalies on the basis of the limited labeled anomalies and a large volume of unlabeled data. This serves as an augmentation to facilitate the detection of new anomalies. Our proposed algorithm, named Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Mixup (NNG-Mix), efficiently integrates information from both labeled and unlabeled data to generate pseudo-anomalies. We compare the performance of this novel algorithm with commonly applied augmentation techniques, such as Mixup and Cutout. We evaluate NNG-Mix by training various existing semi-supervised and supervised anomaly detection algorithms on the original training data along with the generated pseudo-anomalies. Through extensive experiments on 57 benchmark datasets in ADBench, reflecting different data types, we demonstrate that NNG-Mix outperforms other data augmentation methods. It yields significant performance improvements compared to the baselines trained exclusively on the original training data.

This mechanism ensures the client's data is not shared with any third party, terminating privacy leakage. The model examines each data packet separately and predicts anomalies.

In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of transformers to adversarial samples for system defenders (i.e., resiliency to adversarial perturbations generated on different types of architectures) and their adversarial strength for system attackers (i.e., transferability of adversarial samples generated by transformers to other target models). To that effect, we first fine-tune a set of pre-trained transformer, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and hybrid (an ensemble of transformer and CNN) models to solve different downstream image-based tasks. Then, we use an attack algorithm to craft 19,367 adversarial examples on each model for each task. The transferability of these adversarial examples is measured by evaluating each set on other models to determine which models offer more adversarial strength, and consequently, more robustness against these attacks. We find that the adversarial examples crafted on transformers offer the highest transferability rate (i.e., 25.7% higher than the average) onto other models. Similarly, adversarial examples crafted on other models have the lowest rate of transferability (i.e., 56.7% lower than the average) onto transformers.

In this context, a crucial role is played by Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), which are security devices designed to identify and mitigate attacks to modern networks. Data-driven approaches based on Machine Learning (ML) have gained more and more popularity for executing the classification tasks required by signature-based IDSs. However, typical ML models adopted for this purpose do not properly take into account the uncertainty associated with their prediction. This poses significant challenges, as they tend to produce misleadingly high classification scores for both misclassified inputs and inputs belonging to unknown classes (e.g. novel attacks), limiting the trustworthiness of existing ML-based solutions. In this paper, we argue that ML-based IDSs should always provide accurate uncertainty quantification to avoid overconfident predictions. In fact, an uncertainty-aware classification would be beneficial to enhance closed-set classification performance, would make it possible to carry out Active Learning, and would help recognize inputs of unknown classes as truly unknowns, unlocking open-set classification capabilities and Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection . To verify it, we compare various ML-based methods for uncertainty quantification and for open-set classification, either specifically designed for or tailored to the domain of network intrusion detection . Moreover, we develop a custom model based on Bayesian Neural Networks to ensure reliable uncertainty estimates and improve the OoD detection capabilities, thus showing how proper uncertainty quantification can be exploited to significantly enhance the trustworthiness of ML-based IDSs. △ Less"}

Recognizing that sleep videos exhibit minimal motion, this work investigates the fundamental question: \"Are respiratory events adequately reflected in human motions during sleep?\" Analyzing the largest sleep video dataset of 5,098 hours, we establish correlations between OSA events and human motions during sleep.

Such deviations are either normal occurrences, such as software updates and new user activities, or abnormalities, such as misconfigurations, latency issues, intrusions , and software bugs. Regardless, novel behaviors are of great interest to developers, and there is a genuine need for efficient and effective methods to detect them. Nowadays, researchers consider system calls to be the most fine-grained and accurate source of information to investigate the behavior of computer systems . Accordingly, this paper introduces a novelty detection methodology that relies on a probability distribution over sequences of system calls, which can be seen as a language model. Language models estimate the likelihood of sequences, and since novelties deviate from previously observed behaviors by definition, they would be unlikely under the model. Following the success of neural networks for language models, three architectures are evaluated in this work: the widespread LSTM, the state-of-the-art Transformer, and the lower-complexity Longformer. However, large neural networks typically require an enormous amount of data to be trained effectively, and to the best of our knowledge, no massive modern datasets of kernel traces are publicly available.

HTTP-based Trojan, in particular, accounts for a considerable proportion of them. Moreover, as the network environment becomes more complex, HTTP-based Trojan is more concealed than others. At present, many intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are increasingly difficult to effectively detect such Trojan traffic due to the inherent shortcomings of the methods used and the backwardness of training data. Classical anomaly detection and traditional machine learning-based (TML-based) anomaly detection are highly dependent on expert knowledge to extract features artificially, which is difficult to implement in HTTP-based Trojan traffic detection . Deep learning-based (DL-based) anomaly detection has been locally applied to IDSs, but it cannot be transplanted to HTTP-based Trojan traffic detection directly.

This results in high workloads on security operators who need to manually verify all reported alerts, often leading to fatigue and incorrect decisions. To generate more meaningful alerts and alleviate these issues, the research domain focused on multi-step attack analysis proposes approaches for filtering, clustering, and correlating IDS alerts, as well as generation of attack graphs. Unfortunately, existing data sets are outdated, unreliable, narrowly focused, or only suitable for IDS evaluation. Since hardly any suitable benchmark data sets are publicly available, researchers often resort to private data sets that prevent reproducibility of evaluations. We therefore generate a new alert data set that we publish alongside this paper. The data set contains alerts from three distinct IDSs monitoring eight executions of a multi-step attack as well as simulations of normal user behavior. To illustrate the potential of our data set, we experiment with alert prioritization as well as two open-source tools for meta-alert generation and attack graph extraction. △ Less"}

However, some owners are reluctant of availing their data out of the company due to data security concerns. Federated learning(FL) as a distributed machine learning approach performs training of a machine learning model on the device that gathered the data itself. In this scenario, data is not share over the network for training purpose. Fedavg as one of FL algorithms permits a model to be copied to participating devices during a training session. The devices could be chosen at random, and a device can be aborted. The resulting models are sent to the coordinating server and then average models from the devices that finished training. The process is repeated until a desired model accuracy is achieved. By doing this, FL approach solves the privacy problem for IoT/ IIoT devices that held sensitive data for the owners. In this paper, we leverage the benefits of FL and implemented Fedavg algorithm on a recent dataset that represent the modern IoT/ IIoT device networks. The results were almost the same as the centralized machine learning approach. We also evaluated some shortcomings of Fedavg such as unfairness that happens during the training when struggling devices do not participate for every stage of training. This inefficient training of local or global model could lead in a high number of false alarms in intrusion detection systems for IoT/IIoT gadgets developed using Fedavg. Hence, after evaluating the FedAv deep auto encoder with centralized deep auto encoder ML, we further proposed and designed a Fair Fedavg algorithm that will be evaluated in the future work. △ Less"}

The internet attacks such as Denial of service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks severely harm a website or server and make them unavailable to other users. Network Monitoring and control systems have found it challenging to identify the many classes of DoS and DDoS attacks since each operates uniquely. Hence a powerful technique is required for attack detection . Traditional machine learning techniques are inefficient in handling extensive network data and cannot extract high-level features for attack detection . Therefore, an effective deep learning-based intrusion detection system is developed in this paper for DoS and DDoS attack classification. This model includes various phases and starts with the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) based technique to address the class imbalance issue in the dataset. Then a deep learning algorithm based on ResNet-50 extracts the critical features for each class in the dataset. After that, an optimized AlexNet-based classifier is implemented for detecting the attacks separately, and the essential parameters of the classifier are optimized using the Atom search optimization algorithm. The proposed approach was evaluated on benchmark datasets, CCIDS2019 and UNSW-NB15, using key classification metrics and achieved 99.37% accuracy for the UNSW-NB15 dataset and 99.33% for the CICIDS2019 dataset.

Recent studies have explored a variety of techniques to analyze provenance graphs for automated host intrusion detection , focusing particularly on advanced persistent threats. Sifting through their design documents, we identify four common dimensions that drive the development of provenance-based intrusion detection systems (PIDSes): scope (can PIDSes detect modern attacks that infiltrate across application boundaries?), attack agnosticity (can PIDSes detect novel attacks without a priori knowledge of attack characteristics?), timeliness (can PIDSes efficiently monitor host systems as they run?), and attack reconstruction (can PIDSes distill attack activity from large provenance graphs so that sysadmins can easily understand and quickly respond to system intrusion ?). We present KAIROS, the first PIDS that simultaneously satisfies the desiderata in all four dimensions, whereas existing approaches sacrifice at least one and struggle to achieve comparable detection performance. Kairos leverages a novel graph neural network-based encoder-decoder architecture that learns the temporal evolution of a provenance graph's structural changes to quantify the degree of anomalousness for each system event. Then, based on this fine-grained information, Kairos reconstructs attack footprints, generating compact summary graphs that accurately describe malicious activity over a stream of system audit logs.

Unfortunately, the CAN bus is inherently insecure; in fact, it completely lacks controls such as authentication, authorization, and confidentiality (i.e., encryption). Therefore, researchers have travailed to develop automotive security enhancements. The automotive intrusion detection system (IDS) is especially popular in the literature -- due to its relatively low cost in terms of money, resource utilization, and implementation effort. That said, developing and evaluating an automotive IDS is often challenging; if researchers do not have access to a test vehicle, then they are forced to depend on publicly available CAN data -- which is not without limitations. Lack of access to adequate CAN data, then, becomes a barrier to entry into automotive security research. We seek to lower that barrier to entry by introducing a new CAN dataset to facilitate the development and evaluation of automotive IDSs. Our dataset, dubbed can-train-and-test, provides CAN data from four different vehicles produced by two different manufacturers. The attack captures for each vehicle model are equivalent, enabling researchers to assess the ability of a given IDS to generalize to different vehicle models and even different vehicle manufacturers. Our dataset contains replayable .log files as well as labeled and unlabeled .csv files, thereby meeting a variety of development and evaluation needs.

It employs a novel ownership-based resource management model to facilitate automated deallocation. This model is anticipated to eliminate memory leaks. However, we observed that user intervention drives it into semi-automated memory management and makes it error-prone to cause leaks. In contrast to violating memory-safety guarantees restricted by the unsafe keyword, the boundary of leaking memory is implicit, and the compiler would not emit any warnings for developers. In this paper, we present rCanary, a static, non- intrusive , and fully automated model checker to detect leaks across the semiautomated boundary. We design an encoder to abstract data with heap allocation and formalize a refined leak-free memory model based on boolean satisfiability. It can generate SMT-Lib2 format constraints for Rust MIR and is implemented as a Cargo component. We evaluate rCanary by using flawed package benchmarks collected from the pull requests of open-source Rust projects. The results indicate that it is possible to recall all these defects with acceptable false positives.

The bulk of anti-malware systems categorizes malware using regular expressions and patterns.

In many crucial Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications such as healthcare and defense, the early detection of security attacks plays a significant role in protecting huge resources. An intrusion detection system is used to address this problem. The signature-based approaches fail to detect zero-day attacks. So anomaly-based detection particularly AI tools, are becoming popular. In addition, the imbalanced dataset leads to biased results. In Machine Learning (ML) models, F1 score is an important metric to measure the accuracy of class-level correct predictions. The model may fail to detect the target samples if the F1 is considerably low. It will lead to unrecoverable consequences in sensitive applications such as healthcare and defense. So, any improvement in the F1 score has significant impact on the resource protection. In this paper, we present a framework for ML-based intrusion detection system for an imbalanced dataset. In this study, the most recent dataset, namely CICIoT2023 is considered. The random forest (RF) algorithm is used in the proposed framework. The proposed approach improves 3.72%, 3.75% and 4.69% in precision, recall and F1 score, respectively, with the existing method.

These two problems often appear simultaneously, posing serious challenges to fine-grained NIDS. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised fine-grained intrusion detection framework, SF-IDS, to achieve attack classification in the label-limited and highly class imbalanced case. We design a self-training backbone model called RI-1DCNN to boost the feature extraction by reconstructing the input samples into a multichannel image format. The uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels is evaluated and used as a reference for pseudo-label filtering in combination with the prediction probability.

While conventional ML-based IDSs are based on a centralized architecture where IoT devices share their data with a central server for model training, we propose a novel approach that is based on federated learning (FL). However, conventional FL is ineffective in the considered scenario, due to the high statistical heterogeneity of data collected by IoT devices.

We reveal that the underlying cause is entangled distributions of flow features. This motivates us to propose DIDS-MFL, a disentangled intrusion detection method to handle various intrusion detection scenarios. DIDS-MFL involves two key components, respectively: a double Disentanglementbased Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) and a plug-and-play Multi-scale Few-shot Learning-based (MFL) intrusion detection module. Specifically, the proposed DIDS first disentangles traffic features by a non-parameterized optimization, automatically differentiating tens and hundreds of complex features of various attacks. Such differentiated features will be further disentangled to highlight the attack-specific features. Our DIDS additionally uses a novel graph diffusion method that dynamically fuses the network topology in evolving data streams. Furthermore, the proposed MFL involves an alternating optimization framework to address the entangled representations in few-shot traffic threats with rigorous derivation. MFL first captures multiscale information in latent space to distinguish attack-specific information and then optimizes the disentanglement term to highlight the attack-specific information.

An accurate and timely threat attribution plays an important role in deterring future attacks by applying appropriate and timely defense mechanisms. Manual analysis of attack patterns gathered by honeypot deployments, intrusion detection systems , firewalls, and via trace-back procedures is still the preferred method of security analysts for cyber threat attribution. Such attack patterns are low-level Indicators of Compromise (IOC). They represent Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTP), and software tools used by the adversaries in their campaigns. The adversaries rarely re-use them. They can also be manipulated, resulting in false and unfair attribution. To empirically evaluate and compare the effectiveness of both kinds of IOC, there are two problems that need to be addressed. The first problem is that in recent research works, the ineffectiveness of low-level IOC for cyber threat attribution has been discussed intuitively. An empirical evaluation for the measure of the effectiveness of low-level IOC based on a real-world dataset is missing. The second problem is that the available dataset for high-level IOC has a single instance for each predictive class label that cannot be used directly for training machine learning models. To address these problems in this research work, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of low-level IOC based on a real-world dataset that is specifically built for comparative analysis with high-level IOC.

Albeit with limitations on physical resources and capabilities, they allow for the efficient extraction of detailed traffic information, which can then be utilised by Machine Learning (ML) algorithms responsible for identifying security threats. In addressing resource constraints, existing solutions in the literature rely on compressing network data through the collection of statistical traffic features in the data plane. While this compression saves memory resources in switches and minimises the burden on the control channel between the data and the control plane, it also results in a loss of information available to the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), limiting access to packet payload, categorical features, and the semantic understanding of network communications, such as the behaviour of packets within traffic flows. This paper proposes P4DDLe, a framework that exploits the flexibility of P4-based programmable data planes for packet-level feature extraction and pre-processing. P4DDLe leverages the programmable data plane to extract raw packet features from the network traffic, categorical features included, and to organise them in a way that the semantics of traffic flows are preserved. To minimise memory and control channel overheads, P4DDLe selectively processes and filters packet-level data, so that only the features required by the NIDS are collected. The experimental evaluation with recent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack data demonstrates that the proposed approach is very efficient in collecting compact and high-quality representations of network flows, ensuring precise detection of DDoS attacks. △ Less"}

In addition, prevention is limited to few primitive options like dropping network packets or extreme options, e.g., ECU Bus-off state. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of vehicular Intrusion Resilience Systems (IRS) that ensures the resilience of critical applications despite assumed faults or zero-day attacks, as long as threat assumptions are met. IRS enables running a vehicular application in a replicated way, i.e., as a Replicated State Machine, over several ECUs, and then requiring the replicated processes to reach a form of Byzantine agreement before changing their local state. Our study rides the mutation of modern vehicular environments, which are closing the gap between simple and resource-constrained \"real-time and embedded systems \", and complex and powerful \"information technology\" ones. It shows that current vehicle (e.g., Zonal) architectures and networks are becoming plausible for such modular fault and intrusion tolerance solutions,deemed too heavy in the past. Our evaluation on a simulated Automotive Ethernet network running two state-of-the-art agreement protocols (Damysus and Hotstuff) shows that the achieved latency and throughout are feasible for many Automotive applications. △ Less"}

Two Many-to-One (M2O) protocols are proposed, the Hybrid Group Authentication and Key Acquisition (HGAKA) protocol and the Hybrid Group Access (HGA) protocol. The protocols use a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic primitives to facilitate multifactor group authentication. The informal analysis and formal security verification show that the protocols satisfy the desirable security requirements and are secure against authentication attacks. △ Less"}

Reaping these benefits requires CAVs to autonomously navigate to target destinations. To this end, each CAV's navigation controller must leverage the information collected by sensors and wireless systems for decision-making on longitudinal and lateral movements. However, enabling autonomous navigation for CAVs requires a convergent integration of communication, control, and learning systems . The goal of this article is to explicitly expose the challenges related to this convergence and propose solutions to address them in two major use cases: Uncoordinated and coordinated CAVs. In particular, challenges related to the navigation of uncoordinated CAVs include stable path tracking, robust control against cyber-physical attacks, and adaptive navigation controller design. Meanwhile, when multiple CAVs coordinate their movements during navigation, fundamental problems such as stable formation, fast collaborative learning, and distributed intrusion detection are analyzed. For both cases, solutions using the convergence of communication theory, control theory, and machine learning are proposed to enable effective and secure CAV navigation.

However, IoT devices are highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which may result in security breaches and data leakages. To effectively prevent these attacks, a variety of machine learning-based network intrusion detection methods for IoT networks have been developed, which often rely on either feature extraction or feature selection techniques for reducing the dimension of input data before being fed into machine learning models. This aims to make the detection complexity low enough for real-time operations, which is particularly vital in any intrusion detection systems . This paper provides a comprehensive comparison between these two feature reduction methods of intrusion detection in terms of various performance metrics, namely, precision rate, recall rate, detection accuracy, as well as runtime complexity, in the presence of the modern UNSW-NB15 dataset as well as both binary and multiclass classification. For example, in general, the feature selection method not only provides better detection performance but also lower training and inference time compared to its feature extraction counterpart, especially when the number of reduced features K increases. However, the feature extraction method is much more reliable than its selection counterpart, particularly when K is very small, such as K = 4. Additionally, feature extraction is less sensitive to changing the number of reduced features K than feature selection, and this holds true for both binary and multiclass classifications. Based on this comparison, we provide a useful guideline for selecting a suitable intrusion detection type for each specific scenario, as detailed in Tab. 14 at the end of Section IV. △ Less"}

For instance, ECUs can be impersonated by adversaries who have infiltrated an automotive CAN and disable or invoke unintended vehicle functions such as brakes, acceleration, or safety mechanisms. Further, the quality of security approaches varies wildly between manufacturers. Thus, research and development of after-market security solutions have grown remarkably in recent years.

However, the need to learn large amounts of labelled data often limits the applicability of ML-based IDSs to cybersystems that only have access to private local data, while distributed systems such as Supply Chains have multiple components, each of which must preserve its private data while being targeted by the same attack To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Decentralized and Online Federated Learning Intrusion Detection (DOF-ID) architecture based on the G-Network model with collaborative learning, that allows each IDS used by a specific component to learn from the experience gained in other components, in addition to its own local data, without violating the data privacy of other components.

This compression scheme exploits similarities in the outgoing sets of transitions among states to achieve strong compression while maintaining high throughput for matching. The \\ddfa{} algorithm and later variants of it, unfortunately, require at least quadratic compression time since they compare all pairs of states to compute an optimal compression. This is too slow and, in some cases, even infeasible for collections of regular expression in modern intrusion detection systems that produce DFAs of millions of states. Our main result is a simple, general framework for constructing \\ddfa{} based on locality-sensitive hashing that constructs an approximation of the optimal \\ddfa{} in near-linear time. We apply our approach to the original \\ddfa{} compression algorithm and two important variants, and we experimentally evaluate our algorithms on DFAs from widely used modern intrusion detection systems . Overall, our new algorithms compress up to an order of magnitude faster than existing solutions with either no or little loss of compression size. Consequently, our algorithms are significantly more scalable and can handle larger collections of regular expressions than previous solutions. △ Less"}

However, there are limitations in detecting specific types of attacks with NIDS, such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). Additionally, NIDS is restricted in observing complete traffic information due to encrypted traffic or a lack of authority. To address these limitations, a Host-based Intrusion Detection system (HIDS) evaluates resources in the host, including logs, files, and folders, to identify APT attacks that routinely inject malicious files into victimized nodes. In this study, a hybrid network intrusion detection system that combines NIDS and HIDS is proposed to improve intrusion detection performance. The feature flattening technique is applied to flatten two-dimensional host-based features into one-dimensional vectors, which can be directly used by traditional Machine Learning (ML) models. A two-stage collaborative classifier is introduced that deploys two levels of ML algorithms to identify network intrusions . In the first stage, a binary classifier is used to detect benign samples. All detected attack types undergo a multi-class classifier to reduce the complexity of the original problem and improve the overall detection performance. The proposed method is shown to generalize across two well-known datasets, CICIDS 2018 and NDSec-1. Performance of XGBoost, which represents conventional ML, is evaluated. Combining host and network features enhances attack detection performance (macro average F1 score) by 8.1% under the CICIDS 2018 dataset and 3.7% under the NDSec-1 dataset. Meanwhile, the two-stage collaborative classifier improves detection performance for most single classes, especially for DoS-LOIC-UDP and DoS-SlowHTTPTest, with improvements of 30.7% and 84.3%, respectively, when compared with the traditional ML XGBoost. △ Less"}

While most adversarial attack research focuses on computer vision datasets, recent studies have explored the suitability of these attacks against ML-based network security entities, especially NIDS, due to the wide difference between different domains regarding the generation of adversarial attacks. To further explore the practicality of adversarial attacks against ML-based NIDS in-depth, this paper presents three distinct contributions: identifying numerous practicality issues for evasion adversarial attacks on ML-NIDS using an attack tree threat model, introducing a taxonomy of practicality issues associated with adversarial attacks against ML-based NIDS, and investigating how the dynamicity of some real-world ML models affects adversarial attacks against NIDS.

However, most existing studies have been focused on sacrificing the detection rate of the majority class in order to improve the detection rate of the minority class in class-imbalanced IoT networks. Although this way can reduce the false negative rate of minority classes, it both wastes resources and reduces the credibility of the intrusion detection systems .

The main objective of cloud computing is to accommodate users' growing needs by decreasing dependence on human resources, minimizing expenses, and enhancing the speed of data access. Nevertheless, preserving security and privacy in cloud computing systems pose notable challenges. This issue arises because these systems have a distributed structure, which is susceptible to unsanctioned access - a fundamental problem. In the context of cloud computing, the provision of services on demand makes them targets for common assaults like Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, which include Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). These onslaughts can be classified into three categories: bandwidth consumption attacks, specific application attacks, and connection layer attacks. Most of the studies conducted in this arena have concentrated on a singular type of attack, with the concurrent detection of multiple DoS attacks often overlooked. This article proposes a suitable method to identify four types of assaults: HTTP, Database, TCP SYN, and DNS Flood. The aim is to present a universal algorithm that performs effectively in detecting all four attacks instead of using separate algorithms for each one. In this technique, seventeen server parameters like memory usage, CPU usage, and input/output counts are extracted and monitored for changes, identifying the failure point using the CUSUM algorithm to calculate the likelihood of each attack.

There comes a recently increasing trend of using a record and replay approach to facilitate the testing process. However, the graphic user interface (GUI) of an app running on different devices and platforms differs dramatically. This complicates the record and replay process as the presence, appearance and layout of the GUI widgets in the recording phase and replaying phase can be inconsistent. Existing techniques resort to instrumenting into the underlying system to obtain the app metadata for widget identification and matching between various devices. But such intrusive practices are limited by the accessibility and accuracy of the metadata on different platforms. On the other hand, several recent works attempt to derive the GUI information by analyzing the GUI image. Nevertheless, their performance is curbed by the applied preliminary visual approaches and the failure to consider the divergence of the same GUI displayed on different devices. To address the challenge, we propose a non- intrusive cross-device and cross-platform system NiCro. NiCro utilizes the state-of-the-art GUI widget detector to detect widgets from GUI images and then analyses a set of comprehensive information to match the widgets across diverse devices. At the system level, NiCro can interact with a virtual device farm and a robotic arm system to perform cross-device, cross-platform testing non- intrusively .

Concurrently, the abilities of adversaries to evade security have also increased with the support of AI/ML models. Therefore, defenders need to proactively prepare for evasion attacks that exploit the detection mechanisms of NIDS. Recent studies have found that the perturbation of flow-based and packet-based features can deceive ML models, but these approaches have limitations. Perturbations made to the flow-based features are difficult to reverse-engineer, while samples generated with perturbations to the packet-based features are not playable. Our methodological framework, Deep PackGen, employs deep reinforcement learning to generate adversarial packets and aims to overcome the limitations of approaches in the literature. By taking raw malicious network packets as inputs and systematically making perturbations on them, Deep PackGen camouflages them as benign packets while still maintaining their functionality. In our experiments, using publicly available data, Deep PackGen achieved an average adversarial success rate of 66.4\\% against various ML models and across different attack types. Our investigation also revealed that more than 45\\% of the successful adversarial samples were out-of-distribution packets that evaded the decision boundaries of the classifiers. The knowledge gained from our study on the adversary's ability to make specific evasive perturbations to different types of malicious packets can help defenders enhance the robustness of their NIDS against evolving adversarial attacks. △ Less"}

Although there are a few commonly used datasets, they may not reflect realistic ICS network data, lack necessary features for effective anomaly detection , or be outdated. This paper presents the 'ICS-Flow' dataset, which offers network data and process state variables logs for supervised and unsupervised ML-based IDS assessment. The network data includes normal and anomalous network packets and flows captured from simulated ICS components and emulated networks. The anomalies were injected into the system through various attack techniques commonly used by hackers to modify network traffic and compromise ICSs. We also proposed open-source tools, `ICSFlowGenerator' for generating network flow parameters from Raw network packets. The final dataset comprises over 25,000,000 raw network packets, network flow records, and process variable logs. The paper describes the methodology used to collect and label the dataset and provides a detailed data analysis.

The industrial systems are commissioned for longer duration amounting to decades, often resulting in non-compliance to technological advancements in industrial cybersecurity mechanisms. The unavailability of network infrastructure information makes designing the security policies or configuring the cybersecurity countermeasures such as Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) challenging. An empirical solution is to self-learn the network infrastructure information of an industrial system from its monitored network traffic to make the network transparent for downstream analyses tasks such as anomaly detection . In this work, a Python-based industrial communication paradigm-aware framework, named PROFINET Operations Enumeration and Tracking (POET), that enumerates different industrial operations executed in a deterministic order of a PROFINET-based industrial system is reported. The operation-driving industrial network protocol frames are dissected for enumeration of the operations. For the requirements of capturing the transitions between industrial operations triggered by the communication events, the Finite State Machines (FSM) are modelled to enumerate the PROFINET operations of the device, connection and system . POET extracts the network information from network traffic to instantiate appropriate FSM models (Device, Connection or System ) and track the industrial operations. It successfully detects and reports the anomalies triggered by a network attack in a miniaturized PROFINET-based industrial system , executed through valid network protocol exchanges and resulting in invalid PROFINET operation transition for the device. △ Less"}

But as the deep learning models reached their peak performances, also their limitations in applicability and vulnerabilities were observed. One of the most important reason for the lack of trustworthiness in operational conditions is the absence of intrinsic explainability of the deep learning system , due to the encoding of the knowledge in tensor values and without the inclusion of logical constraints. In this paper, we propose a neuro-symbolic model for the detection of damages in cantilever beams based on a novel cognitive architecture in which we join the processing power of convolutional networks with the interactive control offered by queries realized through the inclusion of real logic directly into the model. The hybrid discriminative model is introduced under the name Logic Convolutional Neural Regressor and it is tested on a dataset of values of the relative natural frequency shifts of cantilever beams derived from an original mathematical relation. While the obtained results preserve all the predictive capabilities of deep learning models, the usage of three distances as predicates for satisfiability, makes the system more trustworthy and scalable for practical applications.

For Network Intrusion Detection (NID), however, scientific advances in ML are still seen with skepticism by practitioners. This disconnection is due to the intrinsically limited scope of research papers, many of which primarily aim to demonstrate new methods ``outperforming'' prior work -- oftentimes overlooking the practical implications for deploying the proposed solutions in real systems . Unfortunately, the value of ML for NID depends on a plethora of factors, such as hardware, that are often neglected in scientific literature. This paper aims to reduce the practitioners' skepticism towards ML for NID by \"changing\" the evaluation methodology adopted in research. After elucidating which \"factors\" influence the operational deployment of ML in NID, we propose the notion of \"pragmatic assessment\", which enable practitioners to gauge the real value of ML methods for NID. Then, we show that the state-of-research hardly allows one to estimate the value of ML for NID. As a constructive step forward, we carry out a pragmatic assessment. We re-assess existing ML methods for NID, focusing on the classification of malicious network traffic, and consider: hundreds of configuration settings; diverse adversarial scenarios; and four hardware platforms. Our large and reproducible evaluations enable estimating the quality of ML for NID. We also validate our claims through a user-study with security practitioners. △ Less"}

FlowTransformer leverages the strengths of transformer models in identifying the long-term behaviour and characteristics of networks, which are often overlooked by most existing NIDSs. By capturing these complex patterns in network traffic, FlowTransformer offers a flexible and efficient tool for researchers and practitioners in the cybersecurity community who are seeking to implement NIDSs using transformer-based models. FlowTransformer allows the direct substitution of various transformer components, including the input encoding, transformer, classification head, and the evaluation of these across any flow-based network dataset. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the FlowTransformer framework, we utilise it to provide an extensive evaluation of various common transformer architectures, such as GPT 2.0 and BERT, on three commonly used public NIDS benchmark datasets. We provide results for accuracy, model size and speed. A key finding of our evaluation is that the choice of classification head has the most significant impact on the model performance. Surprisingly, Global Average Pooling, which is commonly used in text classification, performs very poorly in the context of NIDS. In addition, we show that model size can be reduced by over 50\\%, and inference and training times improved, with no loss of accuracy, by making specific choices of input encoding and classification head instead of other commonly used alternatives. △ Less"}

In the simulation, an attacking agent attempts to capture targets in the environment, while the defender attempts to protect them by enabling defenses. The environment was modeled using attack graphs based on the Meta Attack Language language. We assumed that defensive measures have downtime costs, meaning that the defender agent was penalized for using them. We also assumed that the environment was equipped with an imperfect intrusion detection system that occasionally produces erroneous alerts based on the environment state. To evaluate the setup, we trained the defensive agent with different volumes of intrusion detection system noise. We also trained agents with different attacker strategies and graph sizes. In experiments, the defensive agent using policies trained with reinforcement learning outperformed agents using heuristic policies. Experiments also demonstrated that the policies could generalize across different attacker strategies.

The most common sorts of threats and attacks can affect MANETs. Therefore, it is advised to utilize intrusion detection , which controls the system to detect additional security issues. Monitoring is essential to avoid attacks and provide extra protection against unauthorized access. Although the current solutions have been designed to defeat the attack nodes, they still require additional hardware, have considerable delivery delays, do not offer high throughput or packet delivery ratios, or do not do so without using more energy. The capability of a mobile node to forward packets, which is dependent on the platform's life quality, may be impacted by the absence of the network node power source. We developed the Safe Routing Approach (SRA), which uses behaviour analysis to track and monitor attackers who discard packets during the route discovery process. The attacking node recognition system is made for irregular routing node detection to protect the controller network's usual properties from becoming recognized as an attack node. The suggested method examines the nearby attack nodes and conceals the trusted node in the routing pathway. The path is instantly assigned after the initial discovery of trust nodes based on each node's strength value. It extends the network's life span and reduces packet loss. In terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), energy consumption, network performance, and detection of attack nodes, the suggested approach is contrasted with AIS, ZIDS, and Improved AODV. The findings demonstrate that the recommended strategy performs superior in terms of PDR, residual energy, and network throughput. △ Less"}

Researchers were eager to reverse-engineer the malware and eager to decode the encrypted traffic. Noticeably, organizations were keen on being first to \"solve the puzzle\". Dr. Eric Cole of SANS Institute routinely expressed \"prevention is ideal, but detection is a must\".

A white box Competitive Learning (CL) based eXplainable Intrusion Detection System (X-IDS) offers a potential solution to these problem. CL models utilize an entirely different learning paradigm than EBL approaches. This different learning process makes the CL family of algorithms innately explainable and less resource intensive. In this paper, we create an X-IDS architecture that is based on DARPA's recommendation for explainable systems . In our architecture we leverage CL algorithms like, Self Organizing Maps (SOM), Growing Self Organizing Maps (GSOM), and Growing Hierarchical Self Organizing Map (GHSOM). The resulting models can be data-mined to create statistical and visual explanations.

They also struggle to cope with the rapidly evolving IoT threat landscape due to long delays between the analysis and publication of the detection rules.

However, the data scarcity of IoT hinders the effectiveness of traditional intrusion detection methods. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose the Adaptive Bi-Recommendation and Self-Improving Network (ABRSI) based on unsupervised heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA). The ABRSI transfers enrich intrusion knowledge from a data-rich network intrusion source domain to facilitate effective intrusion detection for data-scarce IoT target domains. The ABRSI achieves fine-grained intrusion knowledge transfer via adaptive bi-recommendation matching. Matching the bi-recommendation interests of two recommender systems and the alignment of intrusion categories in the shared feature space form a mutual-benefit loop. Besides, the ABRSI uses a self-improving mechanism, autonomously improving the intrusion knowledge transfer from four ways. A hard pseudo label voting mechanism jointly considers recommender system decision and label relationship information to promote more accurate hard pseudo label assignment. To promote diversity and target data participation during intrusion knowledge transfer, target instances failing to be assigned with a hard pseudo label will be assigned with a probabilistic soft pseudo label, forming a hybrid pseudo-labelling strategy. Meanwhile, the ABRSI also makes soft pseudo-labels globally diverse and individually certain. Finally, an error knowledge learning mechanism is utilised to adversarially exploit factors that causes detection ambiguity and learns through both current and previous error knowledge, preventing error knowledge forgetfulness. Holistically, these mechanisms form the ABRSI model that boosts IoT intrusion detection accuracy via HDA-assisted intrusion knowledge transfer. △ Less"}

Thus, recent actions and cybersecurity regulations (e.g., UNR 155) require carmakers to implement intrusion detection systems (IDSs) in their vehicles. The IDS should detect cyberattacks and provide additional information to analyze conducted attacks. Although many IDSs have been proposed, considerations regarding their feasibility and explainability remain lacking. This study proposes X-CANIDS, which is a novel IDS for CAN-based IVNs. X-CANIDS dissects the payloads in CAN messages into human-understandable signals using a CAN database. The signals improve the intrusion detection performance compared with the use of bit representations of raw payloads. These signals also enable an understanding of which signal or ECU is under attack. X-CANIDS can detect zero-day attacks because it does not require any labeled dataset in the training phase.

Protecting network assets against attacks requires the application of security countermeasures. Nevertheless, employing countermeasures incurs costs, such as monetary costs, along with time and energy to prepare and deploy the countermeasures. Thus, an Intrusion Response System (IRS) shall consider security and QoS costs when dynamically selecting the countermeasures to address the detected attacks. This has motivated us to formulate a joint Security-vs-QoS optimization problem to select the best countermeasures in an IRS. The problem is then transformed into a matching game-theoretical model. Considering the monetary costs and attack coverage constraints, we first derive the theoretical upper bound for the problem and later propose stable matching-based solutions to address the trade-off. The performance of the proposed solution, considering different settings, is validated over a series of simulations. △ Less"}

This raises many questions in the cybersecurity field, where a growing number of researchers are recently investigating the feasibility of such attacks against machine learning-based security systems , such as intrusion detection systems . The majority of this research demonstrates that it is possible to fool a model using features extracted from a raw data source, but it does not take into account the real implementation of such attacks, i.e., the reverse transformation from theory to practice. The real implementation of these adversarial attacks would be influenced by various constraints that would make their execution more difficult. As a result, the purpose of this study was to investigate the actual feasibility of adversarial attacks, specifically evasion attacks, against network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS), demonstrating that it is entirely possible to fool these ML-based IDSs using our proposed adversarial algorithm while assuming as many constraints as possible in a black-box setting. In addition, since it is critical to design defense mechanisms to protect ML-based IDSs against such attacks, a defensive scheme is presented.

Anomaly detection in power grids aims to detect and discriminate anomalies caused by cyber attacks against the power system , which is essential for keeping power grids working correctly and efficiently. Different methods have been applied for anomaly detection , such as statistical methods and machine learning-based methods. Usually, machine learning-based methods need to model the normal data distribution. In this work, we propose a novel anomaly detection method by modeling the data distribution of normal samples via multiple encoders and decoders. Specifically, the proposed method maps input samples into a latent space and then reconstructs output samples from latent vectors. The extra encoder finally maps reconstructed samples to latent representations. During the training phase, we optimize parameters by minimizing the reconstruction loss and encoding loss. Training samples are re-weighted to focus more on missed correlations between features of normal data. Furthermore, we employ the long short-term memory model as encoders and decoders to test its effectiveness. We also investigate a meta-learning-based framework for hyper-parameter tuning of our approach. Experiment results on network intrusion and power system datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, where our models consistently outperform all baselines. △ Less"}

To reduce the human effort in evaluating outlier detection results and effectively turn the outliers into actionable insights, the users often expect a system to automatically produce interpretable summarizations of subgroups of outlier detection results. Unfortunately, to date no such systems exist. To fill this gap, we propose STAIR which learns a compact set of human understandable rules to summarize and explain the anomaly detection results. Rather than use the classical decision tree algorithms to produce these rules, STAIR proposes a new optimization objective to produce a small number of rules with least complexity, hence strong interpretability, to accurately summarize the detection results. The learning algorithm of STAIR produces a rule set by iteratively splitting the large rules and is optimal in maximizing this objective in each iteration. Moreover, to effectively handle high dimensional, highly complex data sets which are hard to summarize with simple rules, we propose a localized STAIR approach, called L-STAIR. Taking data locality into consideration, it simultaneously partitions data and learns a set of localized rules for each partition. Our experimental study on many outlier benchmark datasets shows that STAIR significantly reduces the complexity of the rules required to summarize the outlier detection results, thus more amenable for humans to understand and evaluate, compared to the decision tree methods. △ Less"}
{"title": "Real-World Choreographic Programming: Full-Duplex Asynchrony and Interoperability", "authors": "Lovro Lugović, Fabrizio Montesi", "pdf_link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03983.pdf", "abstract": "In the paradigm of choreographic programming, the overall behaviour of a distributed system is coded as a choreography from a global viewpoint. The choreography can then be automatically projected (compiled) to a correct implementation for each participant. This paradigm is interesting because it relieves the programmer from manually writing the separate send and receive actions performed by participants, which simplifies development and avoids communication mismatches. However, the applicability of choreographic programming in the real world remains largely unexplored. The reason is twofold. First, while there have been several proposals of choreographic programming languages, none of these languages have been used to implement a realistic, widely-used protocol. Thus there is a lack of experience on how realistic choreographic programs are structured and on the relevance of the different features explored in theoretical models. Second, applications of choreographic programming shown so far are intrusive , in the sense that each participant must use exactly the code projected from the choreography. This prevents using the code generated from choreographies with existing third-party implementations of some participants, something that is very beneficial for testing or might even come as a requirement. This paper addresses both problems. In particular, we carry out the first development in choreographic programming of a widespread real-world protocol: the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client--server protocol. The development is based on Choral, an object-oriented higher-order choreographic programming language (choreographies can be parametric on choreographies and carry state). We find that two of Choral's features are key to our implementation: higher-order choreographies are used for modelling the complex interaction patterns that arise due to IRC's asynchronous nature, while user-definable communication semantics are relevant for achieving interoperability with third-party implementations. In the process we also discover a missing piece: the capability of statically detecting that choices on alternative distributed behaviours are appropriately communicated by means of message types, for which we extend the Choral compiler with an elegant solution based on subtyping. Our Choral implementation of IRC arguably represents a milestone for choreographic programming, since it is the first empirical evidence that the paradigm can be used to faithfully codify protocols found `in the wild'. We observe that the choreographic approach reduces the interaction complexity of our program, compared to the traditional approach of writing separate send and receive actions. To check that our implementation is indeed interoperable with third-party software, we test it against publicly available conformance tests for IRC and some of the most popular IRC client and server software. We also evaluate the performance and scalability of our implementation by performing performance tests. Our experience shows that even if choreographic programming is still in its early life, it can already be applied to a realistic setting. △ Less"}

Historically most research has focused on Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), however due to the volume and speed of this new generation of cyber-attacks it is no longer sufficient to solely detect attacks and leave the response to security analysts. Consequently, research into Intrusion Response Systems (IRS) is accelerating rapidly. As such, new intrusion response approaches, methods and systems have been investigated, prototyped, and deployed. This paper is intended to provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art of IRSs. Specifically, a taxonomy to characterize the lifecycle of IRSs ranging from response selection to response deployment and response implementation is presented. A 10-phase structure to organize the core technical constituents of IRSs is also presented. Following this, an extensive review and analysis of the literature on IRSs published during the past decade is provided, and further classifies them into corresponding phases based on the proposed taxonomy and phase structure. This study provides a new way of classifying IRS research, thus offering in-depth insights into the latest discoveries and findings.

However, the heterogeneous distribution of data and resource-constrained end nodes present challenges for existing anomaly detection models. Due to the advantages of flexible deployment and multi-dimensional resources, high altitude platform stations (HAPSs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are important components of vertical heterogeneous networks (VHetNets), have significant potential for sensing, computing, storage, and communication applications in ubiquitous IoT systems . In this paper, we propose a novel VHetNet-enabled asynchronous federated learning (AFL) framework to enable decentralized UAVs to collaboratively train a global anomaly detection model. In the VHetNet-enabled AFL framework, a HAPS operates as a central aerial server, and the local models trained in UAVs are uploaded to the HAPS for global aggregation due to its wide coverage and strong storage and computation capabilities. We introduce a UAV selection strategy into the AFL framework to prevent UAVs with low local model quality and large energy consumption from affecting the learning efficiency and detection accuracy of the global model. To ensure the security of transmissions between UAVs and the HAPS, we add designed noise to local model parameters in UAVs to achieve differential privacy. Moreover, we propose a compound-action actor-critic (CA2C)-based joint device association, UAV selection, and UAV trajectory planning algorithm to further enhance the overall federated execution efficiency and detection model accuracy. Extensive experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can achieve high detection accuracy with short federated execution time and low energy consumption. △ Less"}

The deep learning-based IDSes are proposed to auto-extract high-level features and eliminate the time-consuming and costly signature extraction process. However, this new generation of IDSes still suffers from a number of challenges. One of the main issues of an IDS is facing traffic concept drift which manifests itself as new (i.e., zero-day) attacks, in addition to the changing behavior of benign users/applications. Furthermore, a practical DL-based IDS needs to be conformed to a distributed architecture to handle big data challenges. We propose a framework for adapting DL-based models to the changing attack/benign traffic behaviors, considering a more practical scenario (i.e., online adaptable IDSes). This framework employs continual deep anomaly detectors in addition to the federated learning approach to solve the above-mentioned challenges. Furthermore, the proposed framework implements sequential packet labeling for each flow, which provides an attack probability score for the flow by gradually observing each flow packet and updating its estimation. We evaluate the proposed framework by employing different deep models (including CNN-based and LSTM-based) over the CIC-IDS2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets. Through extensive evaluations and experiments, we show that the proposed distributed framework is well adapted to the traffic concept drift. More precisely, our results indicate that the CNN-based models are well suited for continually adapting to the traffic concept drift (i.e., achieving an average detection rate of above 95% while needing just 128 new flows for the updating phase), and the LSTM-based models are a good candidate for sequential packet labeling in practical online IDSes (i.e., detecting intrusions by just observing their first 15 packets). △ Less"}

That is, when targeted at some IoT models, a given attack can be detected rather accurately, while when targeted at others the same attack may result in too many false alarms. In this research, we attempt to explain this variability of IoT attack detectability and devise a risk assessment method capable of addressing a key question: how easy is it for an anomaly-based network intrusion detection system to detect a given cyber-attack involving a specific IoT model? In the process of addressing this question we (a) investigate the predictability of IoT network traffic, (b) present a novel taxonomy for IoT attack detection which also encapsulates traffic predictability aspects, (c) propose an expert-based attack detectability estimation method which uses this taxonomy to derive a detectability score (termed `D-Score') for a given combination of IoT model and attack scenario, and (d) empirically evaluate our method while comparing it with a data-driven method. △ Less"}

For this reason, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems tend to suffer from a high false positive rate (FPR). To overcome this, we propose a two-step collaborative anomaly detection method which first uses an autoencoder to differentiate frequent (`benign') and infrequent (possibly `malicious') traffic flows. Clustering is then used to analyze only the infrequent flows and classify them as either known ('rare yet benign') or unknown (`malicious'). Our method is collaborative, in that (1) normal behaviors are characterized more robustly, as they take into account a variety of user interactions and network topologies, and (2) several features are computed based on a pool of identical devices rather than just the inspected device. We evaluated our method empirically, using 21 days of real-world traffic data that emanated from eight identical IoT devices deployed on various networks, one of which was located in our controlled lab where we implemented two popular IoT-related cyber-attacks. Our collaborative anomaly detection method achieved a macro-average area under the precision-recall curve of 0.841, an F1 score of 0.929, and an FPR of only 0.014. These promising results were obtained by using labeled traffic data from our lab as the test set, while training the models on the traffic of devices deployed outside the lab, and thus demonstrate a high level of generalizability.

A malicious node may eavesdrop DIO messages of its neighbor nodes and later replay the captured DIO many times with fixed intervals. In this paper, we present and investigate one of the severe attacks named as a non-spoofed copycat attack, a type of replay based DoS attack against RPL protocol. It is shown that the non-spoofed copycat attack increases the average end-to-end delay (AE2ED) and packet delivery ratio of the network.

Designing an intrusion detection system to ensure security of the industrial ecosystem is difficult as network traffic encompasses various attack types, including new and evolving ones with minor changes.

These limitations result in dataset shift, negatively impacting the machine learning models' predictive abilities and reducing the detection rate against novel attacks. To address the challenges, we propose a novel deep neural network based Meta-Learning framework; INformation FUsion and Stacking Ensemble (INFUSE) for network intrusion detection . First, a hybrid feature space is created by integrating decision and feature spaces. Five different classifiers are utilized to generate a pool of decision spaces.

Existing approaches for detecting attacks are mostly limited to attacks directly compromising individual IoT devices, or, require predefined detection policies. They cannot detect attacks that utilize the control plane of the IoT system to trigger actions in an unintended/malicious context, e.g., opening a smart lock while the smart home residents are absent. In this paper, we tackle this problem and propose ARGUS, the first self-learning intrusion detection system for detecting contextual attacks on IoT environments, in which the attacker maliciously invokes IoT device actions to reach its goals. ARGUS monitors the contextual setting based on the state and actions of IoT devices in the environment. An unsupervised Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used for modeling the typical contextual device behavior and detecting actions taking place in abnormal contextual settings. This unsupervised approach ensures that ARGUS is not restricted to detecting previously known attacks but is also able to detect new attacks.

However, due to their constrained nature, novel mechanisms are required to provide external, and non- intrusive anomaly detection . Among such approaches, one that has gained traction is based on the analysis of the electromagnetic (EM) signals that get emanated during a device's operation. However, one of the most neglected challenges of this approach is the requirement for manually gathering and fingerprinting the signals that correspond to each execution path of the software/firmware. Indeed, even simple programs are comprised of hundreds if not thousands of branches thus, making the fingerprinting stage an extremely time-consuming process that involves the manual labor of a human specialist. To address this issue, we propose a framework for generating synthetic EM signals directly from the machine code. The synthetic signals can be used to train a Machine Learning based (ML) system for anomaly detection . The main advantage of the proposed approach is that it completely removes the need for an elaborate and error-prone fingerprinting stage, thus, dramatically increasing the scalability of the corresponding protection mechanisms. The experimental evaluations indicate that our method provides high detection accuracy (above 90% AUC score) when employed for the detection of injection attacks. Moreover, the proposed methodology inflicts only a small penalty (-1.3%) in accuracy for the detection of the injection of as little as four malicious instructions when compared to the same methods if real signals were to be used. △ Less"}

In particular, anomaly detection in temporal graphs is crucial for many real world applications such as intrusion identification in network systems , detection of ecosystem disturbances and detection of epidemic outbreaks. In this paper, we focus on change point detection in dynamic graphs and address three main challenges associated with this problem: i). how to compare graph snapshots across time, ii). how to capture temporal dependencies, and iii). how to combine different views of a temporal graph. To solve the above challenges, we first propose Laplacian Anomaly Detection (LAD) which uses the spectrum of graph Laplacian as the low dimensional embedding of the graph structure at each snapshot. LAD explicitly models short term and long term dependencies by applying two sliding windows. Next, we propose MultiLAD, a simple and effective generalization of LAD to multi-view graphs. MultiLAD provides the first change point detection method for multi-view dynamic graphs. It aggregates the singular values of the normalized graph Laplacian from different views through the scalar power mean operation. Through extensive synthetic experiments, we show that i). LAD and MultiLAD are accurate and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and their multi-view extensions by a large margin, ii). MultiLAD's advantage over contenders significantly increases when additional views are available, and iii). MultiLAD is highly robust to noise from individual views. In five real world dynamic graphs, we demonstrate that LAD and MultiLAD identify significant events as top anomalies such as the implementation of government COVID-19 interventions which impacted the population mobility in multi-view traffic networks. △ Less"}

The controller's decision to accelerate or decelerate is computed using the target speed of the vehicle and the difference between the vehicle's distance to the lead vehicle and the safe distance from that vehicle. Spoofing the vehicle speed communicated through the Controller Area Network (CAN) of the vehicle impacts negatively the capability of the ACC (Proportional-Integral-Derivative variant) to prevent crashes with the lead vehicle. The paper reports about extending the ACC with a real-time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) capable of detecting speed spoofing attacks with reasonable response time and detection rate, and simulating the proposed extension using the CARLA simulation platform. The results of the simulation are: (1) spoofing the vehicle speed can foil the ACC to falsely accelerate, causing accidents, and (2) extending ACC with ML-based IDS to trigger the brakes when an accident is imminent may mitigate the problem. The findings suggest exploring the capabilities of ML-based IDS to support the resilience mechanisms in mitigating cyber-attacks on vehicles. △ Less"}

By inducing targeted faults into the CPU, the software's call graph can be escaped and the control-flow can be redirected to arbitrary functions inside the program. To protect the control-flow from these attacks, dedicated fault control-flow integrity (CFI) countermeasures are commonly deployed. However, these schemes either have high detection latencies or require intrusive hardware changes. In this paper, we present EC-CFI, a software-based cryptographically enforced CFI scheme with no detection latency utilizing hardware features of recent Intel platforms. Our EC-CFI prototype is designed to prevent an adversary from escaping the program's call graph using faults by encrypting each function with a different key before execution. At runtime, the instrumented program dynamically derives the decryption key, ensuring that the code only can be successfully decrypted when the program follows the intended call graph. To enable this level of protection on Intel commodity systems , we introduce extended page table (EPT) aliasing allowing us to achieve function-granular encryption by combing Intel's TME-MK and virtualization technology. We open-source our custom LLVM-based toolchain automatically protecting arbitrary programs with EC-CFI. Furthermore, we evaluate our EPT aliasing approach with the SPEC CPU2017 and Embench-IoT benchmarks and discuss and evaluate potential TME-MK hardware changes minimizing runtime overheads. △ Less"}

However, successful application of such tool requires large amounts of carefully collected and labeled data for training and testing. In this paper we inspect different versions of ToN-IoT dataset and point out inconsistencies in some versions. We filter the full version of ToN-IoT and present a new version labeled ToN-IoT-R. To ensure generalization we propose a new standardized and compact set of flow features which are derived solely from NetFlowv5-compatible data. We separate numeric data and flags into different categories and propose a new dataset-agnostic normalization approach for numeric features. This allows us to preserve meaning of flow flags and we propose to conduct targeted analysis based on, for instance, network protocols. For flow classification we use E-GraphSage algorithm with modified node initialization technique that allows us to add node degree to node features. We achieve high classification accuracy on ToN-IoT-R and compare it with previously published results for ToN-IoT, NF-ToN-IoT, and NF-ToN-IoT-v2.

Therefore, constructing efficient reduced order models (ROMs) that enable accurate but fast predictions, while retaining the dynamical characteristics of the physical phenomenon as parameters vary, is of paramount importance. In this work, a data-driven, non- intrusive framework which combines ROM construction with reduced dynamics identification, is presented. Starting from a limited amount of full order solutions, the proposed approach leverages autoencoder neural networks with parametric sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to construct a low-dimensional dynamical model. This model can be queried to efficiently compute full-time solutions at new parameter instances, as well as directly fed to continuation algorithms. These aim at tracking the evolution of periodic steady-state responses as functions of system parameters, avoiding the computation of the transient phase, and allowing to detect instabilities and bifurcations. Featuring an explicit and parametrized modeling of the reduced dynamics, the proposed data-driven framework presents remarkable capabilities to generalize with respect to both time and parameters. Applications to structural mechanics and fluid dynamics problems illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method. △ Less"}

NIDS are often developed offline while they face auto-generated port scan infiltration attempts, resulting in a significant time lag from adversarial adaption to NIDS response. To address these challenges, we use hypergraphs focused on internet protocol addresses and destination ports to capture evolving patterns of port scan attacks. The derived set of hypergraph-based metrics are then used to train an ensemble machine learning (ML) based NIDS that allows for real-time adaption in monitoring and detecting port scanning activities, other types of attacks, and adversarial intrusions at high accuracy, precision and recall performances. This ML adapting NIDS was developed through the combination of (1) intrusion examples, (2) NIDS update rules, (3) attack threshold choices to trigger NIDS retraining requests, and (4) a production environment with no prior knowledge of the nature of network traffic. 40 scenarios were auto-generated to evaluate the ML ensemble NIDS comprising three tree-based models. The resulting ML Ensemble NIDS was extended and evaluated with the CIC-IDS2017 dataset. Results show that under the model settings of an Update-ALL-NIDS rule (specifically retrain and update all the three models upon the same NIDS retraining request) the proposed ML ensemble NIDS evolved intelligently and produced the best results with nearly 100% detection performance throughout the simulation. △ Less"}

From a statistical point of view, attacks represent a highly unusual occurrence that deviates significantly from the norm. Blockchain attack detection may benefit from Deep Learning, a field of study whose aim is to discover insights, patterns, and anomalies within massive data repositories. In this work, we define an trusted two way intrusion detection system based on a Hierarchical weighed fuzzy algorithm and self-organized stacked network (SOSN) deep learning model, that is trained exploiting aggregate information extracted by monitoring blockchain activities.

Thus, it makes them difficult to analyze and detect with traditional endpoint detection and response, intrusion detection and prevention systems . To defend against malwares, recent work has proposed different techniques based on signatures and machine learning. In this paper, we propose to use an algebraic topological approach called topological-based data analysis (TDA) to efficiently analyze and detect complex malware patterns. Next, we compare the different TDA techniques (i.e., persistence homology, tomato, TDA Mapper) and existing techniques (i.e., PCA, UMAP, t-SNE) using different classifiers including random forest, decision tree, xgboost, and lightgbm. We also propose some recommendations to deploy the best-identified models for malware detection at scale. Results show that TDA Mapper (combined with PCA) is better for clustering and for identifying hidden relationships between malware clusters compared to PCA. Persistent diagrams are better to identify overlapping malware clusters with low execution time compared to UMAP and t-SNE.

However, PLM domain fine-tuning is commonly based on the masked word or sentence prediction costs that are inconsistent with the back-end AD detection task. To this end, this paper investigates the use of prompt-based fine-tuning of PLMs that consistently uses AD classification errors as the training objective function. Disfluency features based on hesitation or pause filler token frequencies are further incorporated into prompt phrases during PLM fine-tuning. The decision voting based combination among systems using different PLMs (BERT and RoBERTa) or systems with different fine-tuning paradigms (conventional masked-language modelling fine-tuning and prompt-based fine-tuning) is further applied.

Indeed, the development of deep learning techniques paved the way to build more complex and effective threat detection models.

Current approaches rely on powerful centralized servers that receive data from all their parties - violating basic privacy constraints and substantially affecting response times and operational costs due to the huge communication overheads. To mitigate these issues, Federated Learning emerged as a promising approach, where different agents collaboratively train a shared model, without exposing training data to others or requiring a compute-intensive centralized infrastructure. This work presents GowFed, a novel network threat detection system that combines the usage of Gower Dissimilarity matrices and Federated averaging. Different approaches of GowFed have been developed based on state-of the-art knowledge: (1) a vanilla version; and (2) a version instrumented with an attention mechanism. Furthermore, each variant has been tested using simulation oriented tools provided by TensorFlow Federated framework. In the same way, a centralized analogous development of the Federated systems is carried out to explore their differences in terms of scalability and performance - across a set of designed experiments/scenarios. Overall, GowFed intends to be the first stepping stone towards the combined usage of Federated Learning and Gower Dissimilarity matrices to detect network threats in industrial-level networks. △ Less"}

Operational ICSs are not safe environments to research intrusion detection systems due to the possibility of catastrophic risks. Therefore, realistic ICS testbeds enable researchers to analyze and validate their intrusion detection algorithms in a controlled environment. Although various ICS testbeds have been developed, researchers' access to a low-cost, adaptable, and customizable testbed that can accurately simulate industrial control systems and suits security research is still an important issue.

In various applications, such as computer vision, domain adaptation techniques have been successful in mitigating the gap between the distributions of the training and test data. In the case of network intrusion detection however, the state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches have had limited success. According to recent studies, as well as our own results, the performance of an NIDS considerably deteriorates when the `unseen' test dataset does not follow the training dataset distribution. In some cases, swapping the train and test datasets makes this even more severe. In order to enhance the generalisibility of machine learning based network intrusion detection systems , we propose to extract domain invariant features using adversarial domain adaptation from multiple network domains, and then apply an unsupervised technique for recognising abnormalities, i.e., intrusions . More specifically, we train a domain adversarial neural network on labelled source domains, extract the domain invariant features, and train a One-Class SVM (OSVM) model to detect anomalies. At test time, we feedforward the unlabeled test data to the feature extractor network to project it into a domain invariant space, and then apply OSVM on the extracted features to achieve our final goal of detecting intrusions .

Although a large body of work has recently emerged highlighting various physical covert channels, these attacks have mostly targeted open-loop cyber-physical systems where the covert channels exist on physical channels that are not being monitored by the victim. Network architectures such as fog computing push sensitive data to cyber-physical edge devices--whose physical side channels are typically monitored via state estimation. In this paper, we formalize covert data exfiltration that uses existing cyber-physical models and infrastructure of individual devices to exfiltrate data in a stealthy manner, i.e., we propose a method to circumvent cyber-physical state estimation intrusion detection techniques while exfiltrating sensitive data from the network. We propose a generalized model for encoding and decoding sensitive data within cyber-physical control loops. We evaluate our approach on a distributed IoT network that includes computation nodes residing on physical drones as well as on an industrial control system for the control of a robotic arm.

However, it has not yet been systematically evaluated how robust FL-based NIDSs are against existing privacy attacks under existing defenses. To address this issue, we propose two privacy evaluation metrics designed for FL-based NIDSs, including (1) privacy score that evaluates the similarity between the original and recovered traffic features using reconstruction attacks, and (2) evasion rate against NIDSs using adversarial attack with the recovered traffic. We conduct experiments to illustrate that existing defenses provide little protection and the corresponding adversarial traffic can even evade the SOTA NIDS Kitsune. To defend against such attacks and build a more robust FL-based NIDS, we further propose FedDef, a novel optimization-based input perturbation defense strategy with theoretical guarantee. It achieves both high utility by minimizing the gradient distance and strong privacy protection by maximizing the input distance.

Because anomaly-based models classify an unseen pattern as a threat where it may be normal but not included in the training dataset. This type of problem is called overfitting where the model is not able to generalize.

ITS is data-driven and enabled by the profusion of sensors ranging from pneumatic tubes to smart cameras. This work explores a novel data source based on optical fibre-based distributed acoustic sensors (DAS) for traffic analysis. Detecting the type of vehicle and estimating the occupancy of vehicles are prime concerns in ITS. The first is motivated by the need for tracking, controlling, and forecasting traffic flow. The second targets the regulation of high occupancy vehicle lanes in an attempt to reduce emissions and congestion. These tasks are often conducted by individuals inspecting vehicles or through the use of emerging computer vision technologies. The former is not scale-able nor efficient whereas the latter is intrusive to passengers' privacy. To this end, we propose a deep learning technique to analyse DAS signals to address this challenge through continuous sensing and without exposing personal information. We propose a deep learning method for processing DAS signals and achieve 92% vehicle classification accuracy and 92-97% in occupancy detection based on DAS data collected under controlled conditions. △ Less"}

The basic task of an IDS is to act as the first line of defense, in detecting attacks on the internet. As intrusion tactics from intruders become more sophisticated and difficult to detect , researchers have started to apply novel Machine Learning (ML) techniques to effectively detect intruders and hence preserve internet users' information and overall trust in the entire internet network security. Over the last decade, there has been an explosion of research on intrusion detection techniques based on ML and Deep Learning (DL) architectures on various cyber security-based datasets such as the DARPA, KDDCUP'99, NSL-KDD, CAIDA, CTU-13, UNSW-NB15. In this research, we review contemporary literature and provide a comprehensive survey of different types of intrusion detection technique that applies Support Vector Machines (SVMs) algorithms as a classifier. We focus only on studies that have been evaluated on the two most widely used datasets in cybersecurity namely: the KDDCUP'99 and the NSL-KDD datasets. We provide a summary of each method, identifying the role of the SVMs classifier, and all other algorithms involved in the studies.

However, the development, validation, and testing of data-driven countermeasures against cyber-attacks, such as machine learning-based detection approaches, lack important data from real-world cyber incidents. Unlike attack data from real-world cyber incidents, infrastructure knowledge and standards are accessible through expert and domain knowledge. Our proposed approach uses domain knowledge to define the behavior of a smart grid under non-attack conditions and detect attack patterns and anomalies. Using a graph-based specification formalism, we combine cross-domain knowledge that enables the generation of whitelisting rules not only for statically defined protocol fields but also for communication ows and technical operation boundaries. Finally, we evaluate our specification-based intrusion detection system against various attack scenarios and assess detection quality and performance. In particular, we investigate a data manipulation attack in a future-orientated use case of an IEC 60870-based SCADA system that controls distributed energy resources in the distribution grid. Our approach can detect severe data manipulation attacks with high accuracy in a timely and reliable manner. △ Less"}

Aspects relating to reliance on the networking domain and the difficulty of achieving security by design pose a challenge today. As a result, data-centric and machine-learning approaches arose as feasible solutions for securing large networks. Although, in the network security domain, ML-based solutions face a challenge regarding the capability to generalize between different contexts. In other words, solutions based on specific network data usually do not perform satisfactorily on other networks. This paper describes the stacked-unsupervised federated learning (FL) approach to generalize on a cross-silo configuration for a flow-based network intrusion detection system (NIDS). The proposed approach we have examined comprises a deep autoencoder in conjunction with an energy flow classifier in an ensemble learning task. Our approach performs better than traditional local learning and naive cross-evaluation (training in one context and testing on another network data). Remarkably, the proposed approach demonstrates a sound performance in the case of non-iid data silos. In conjunction with an informative feature in an ensemble architecture for unsupervised learning, we advise that the proposed FL-based NIDS results in a feasible approach for generalization between heterogeneous networks. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first successful approach to applying unsupervised FL on the problem of network intrusion detection generalization using flow-based data. △ Less"}

Due to the rapid development of Internet-connected systems and Artificial Intelligence in recent years, Artificial Intelligence including Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) has been widely utilized in the fields of cyber security including intrusion detection , malware detection , and spam filtering. However, although Artificial Intelligence-based approaches for the detection and defense of cyber attacks and threats are more advanced and efficient compared to the conventional signature-based and rule-based cyber security strategies, most ML-based techniques and DL-based techniques are deployed in the black-box manner, meaning that security experts and customers are unable to explain how such procedures reach particular conclusions. The deficiencies of transparency and interpretability of existing Artificial Intelligence techniques would decrease human users' confidence in the models utilized for the defense against cyber attacks, especially in current situations where cyber attacks become increasingly diverse and complicated. Therefore, it is essential to apply XAI in the establishment of cyber security models to create more explainable models while maintaining high accuracy and allowing human users to comprehend, trust, and manage the next generation of cyber defense mechanisms. Although there are papers reviewing Artificial Intelligence applications in cyber security areas and the vast literature on applying XAI in many fields including healthcare, financial services, and criminal justice, the surprising fact is that there are currently no survey research articles that concentrate on XAI applications in cyber security. △ Less"}

The RF model was built to classify the alerts as high and low and only pass high likelihood alerts to the analysts. As a result of evaluation experiments, this model can achieve an accuracy of 97% for training validation, 88% for testing with the recent data, and 58% with Security Operation Centre (SOC) reviewed events.

One of the crucial applications of WSNs is intrusion detection and surveillance at the border areas and in the defense establishments. The border areas are stretched in hundreds to thousands of miles, hence, it is not possible to patrol the entire border region. As a result, an enemy may enter from any point absence of surveillance and cause the loss of lives or destroy the military establishments. WSNs can be a feasible solution for the problem of intrusion detection and surveillance at the border areas. Detection of an enemy at the border areas and nearby critical areas such as military cantonments is a time-sensitive task as a delay of few seconds may have disastrous consequences. Therefore, it becomes imperative to design systems that are able to identify and detect the enemy as soon as it comes in the range of the deployed system . In this paper, we have proposed a deep learning architecture based on a fully connected feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the accurate prediction of the number of k-barriers for fast intrusion detection and prevention. We have trained and evaluated the feed-forward ANN model using four potential features, namely area of the circular region, sensing range of sensors, the transmission range of sensors, and the number of sensor for Gaussian and uniform sensor distribution. These features are extracted through Monte Carlo simulation. In doing so, we found that the model accurately predicts the number of k-barriers for both Gaussian and uniform sensor distribution with correlation coefficient (R = 0.78) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 41.15) for the former and R = 0.79 and RMSE = 48.36 for the latter.

Hence, alert prioritization plays a crucial role in deciding which alerts to investigate from an enormous number of alerts that are generated by IDS. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) off-policy method has shown to achieve better results for alert prioritization as compared to other state-of-the-art methods. However, DDPG is prone to the problem of overfitting. Additionally, it also has a poor exploration capability and hence it is not suitable for problems with a stochastic environment. To address these limitations, we present a soft actor-critic based DRL algorithm for alert prioritization (SAC-AP), an off-policy method, based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework that aims to maximize the expected reward while also maximizing the entropy. Further, the interaction between an adversary and a defender is modeled as a zero-sum game and a double oracle framework is utilized to obtain the approximate mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (MSNE). SAC-AP finds robust alert investigation policies and computes pure strategy best response against opponent's mixed strategy. We present the overall design of SAC-AP and evaluate its performance as compared to other state-of-the art alert prioritization methods. We consider defender's loss, i.e., the defender's inability to investigate the alerts that are triggered due to attacks, as the performance metric. Our results show that SAC-AP achieves up to 30% decrease in defender's loss as compared to the DDPG based alert prioritization method and hence provides better protection against intrusions . Moreover, the benefits are even higher when SAC-AP is compared to other traditional alert prioritization methods including Uniform, GAIN, RIO and Suricata. △ Less"}

This paper shows how to use the algebraic state-transition diagram (ASTD) language to develop flexible anomaly detection systems . This paper provides a model for detecting point anomalies using the unsupervised non-parametric technique Kernel Density Estimation to estimate the probability density of event occurrence. The proposed model caters for both the training and the detection phase continuously. The ASTD language streamlines the modeling of detection systems thanks to its process algebraic operators that provide a solution to overcome these challenges.

Experts in network security need to classify signatures by importance for an IDPS to work. We propose and evaluate a machine learning signature classification model with a reject option (RO) to reduce the cost of setting up an IDPS. To train the proposed model, it is essential to design features that are effective for signature classification. Experts classify signatures with predefined if-then rules. An if-then rule returns a label of low, medium, high, or unknown importance based on keyword matching of the elements in the signature. Therefore, we first design two types of features, symbolic features (SFs) and keyword features (KFs), which are used in keyword matching for the if-then rules. Next, we design web information and message features (WMFs) to capture the properties of signatures that do not match the if-then rules. The WMFs are extracted as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) features of the message text in the signatures. The features are obtained by web scraping from the referenced external attack identification systems described in the signature. Because failure needs to be minimized in the classification of IDPS signatures, as in the medical field, we consider introducing a RO in our proposed model. The effectiveness of the proposed classification model is evaluated in experiments with two real datasets composed of signatures labeled by experts: a dataset that can be classified with if-then rules and a dataset with elements that do not match an if-then rule. In the experiment, the proposed model is evaluated. In both cases, the combined SFs and WMFs performed better than the combined SFs and KFs. In addition, we also performed feature analysis. △ Less"}

Four types of process-aware attack scenarios are implemented on a standalone open-source digital twin of an industrial filling plant: command injection, network Denial of Service (DoS), calculated measurement modification, and naive measurement modification. A stacked ensemble classifier is proposed as the real-time intrusion detection , based on the offline evaluation of eight supervised machine learning algorithms. The designed stacked model outperforms previous methods in terms of F1-Score and accuracy, by combining the predictions of various algorithms, while it can detect and classify intrusions in near real-time (0.1 seconds).

The majority of current implementations of GNN-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) rely heavily on labelled network traffic which can not only restrict the amount and structure of input traffic, but also the NIDSs potential to adapt to unseen attacks. To overcome these restrictions, we present Anomal-E, a GNN approach to intrusion and anomaly detection that leverages edge features and graph topological structure in a self-supervised process. This approach is, to the best our knowledge, the first successful and practical approach to network intrusion detection that utilises network flows in a self-supervised, edge leveraging GNN.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), using some forms of AI, have received widespread adoption due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data with a high prediction accuracy. These systems are hosted in the organizational Cyber Security Operation Center (CSoC) as a defense tool to monitor and detect malicious network flow that would otherwise impact the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). CSoC analysts rely on these systems to make decisions about the detected threats. However, IDSs designed using Deep Learning (DL) techniques are often treated as black box models and do not provide a justification for their predictions. This creates a barrier for CSoC analysts, as they are unable to improve their decisions based on the model's predictions. One solution to this problem is to design explainable IDS (X-IDS). This survey reviews the state-of-the-art in explainable AI (XAI) for IDS, its current challenges, and discusses how these challenges span to the design of an X-IDS. In particular, we discuss black box and white box approaches comprehensively. We also present the tradeoff between these approaches in terms of their performance and ability to produce explanations. Furthermore, we propose a generic architecture that considers human-in-the-loop which can be used as a guideline when designing an X-IDS.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for IoV networks can rely on machine learning (ML) to protect the in-vehicle network from cyber-attacks. Blockchain-based Federated Forests (BFFs) could be used to train ML models based on data from IoV entities while protecting the confidentiality of the data and reducing the risks of tampering with the data. However, ML models created this way are still vulnerable to evasion, poisoning, and exploratory attacks using adversarial examples. This paper investigates the impact of various possible adversarial examples on the BFF-IDS. We proposed integrating a statistical detector to detect and extract unknown adversarial samples. By including the unknown detected samples into the dataset of the detector, we augment the BFF-IDS with an additional model to detect original known attacks and the new adversarial inputs. The statistical adversarial detector confidently detected adversarial examples at the sample size of 50 and 100 input samples. Furthermore, the augmented BFF-IDS (BFF-IDS(AUG)) successfully mitigates the adversarial examples with more than 96% accuracy. With this approach, the model will continue to be augmented in a sandbox whenever an adversarial sample is detected and subsequently adopt the BFF-IDS(AUG) as the active security model. Consequently, the proposed integration of the statistical adversarial detector and the subsequent augmentation of the BFF-IDS with detected adversarial samples provides a sustainable security framework against adversarial examples and other unknown attacks. △ Less"}

With ever increasing in the line-rate in core networks, it becomes a great challenge to design a scalable and high performance packet classification solution using hand-tuned heuristics approaches. In this paper, we present a scalable learning-based packet classification engine and its performance evaluation. By exploiting the sparsity of ruleset, our algorithm uses a few effective bits (EBs) to extract a large number of candidate rules with just a few of memory access. These effective bits are learned with deep reinforcement learning and they are used to create a bitmap to filter out the majority of rules which do not need to be full-matched to improve the online system performance. Moreover, our EBs learning-based selection method is independent of the ruleset, which can be applied to varying rulesets. Our multibit tries classification engine outperforms lookup time both in worst and average case by 55% and reduce memory footprint, compared to traditional decision tree without EBs. △ Less"}

Specially, in smart homes where a large number of IoT devices are used having a secure and trusted mechanisms can provide peace of mind for users. Accurate detection of cyber attacks is crucial, however precise identification of the type of attacks plays a huge role if devising the countermeasure for protecting the system . Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have provided promising results for detecting any security attacks for smart applications. However, due to complex nature of the model used for this technique it is not easy for normal users to trust ANN based security solutions. Also, selection of right hyperparameters for ANN architecture plays a crucial role in the accurate detection of security attacks, especially when it come to identifying the subcategories of attacks. In this paper, we propose a model that considers both the issues of explainability of ANN model and the hyperparameter selection for this approach to be easily trusted and adapted by users of smart home applications. Also, our approach considers a subset of the dataset for optimal selection of hyperparamters to reduce the overhead of the process of ANN architecture design. Distinctively this paper focuses on configuration, performance and evaluation of ANN architecture for identification of five categorical attacks and nine subcategorical attacks. Using a very recent IoT dataset our approach showed high performance for intrusion detection with 99.9%, 99.7%, and 97.7% accuracy for Binary, Category, and Subcategory level classification of attacks. △ Less"}

Here we show that similar results can be obtained using a very simple nearest neighbor classification approach, avoiding the inherent complications of training such complex models. The advantages of the nearest neighbor algorithm are: (1) it is very simple to implement; (2) it is extremely robust; (3) it has no parameters, and therefore it cannot overfit the data.

In this paper, we investigate the generalisability property of ML-based NIDSs by extensively evaluating seven supervised and unsupervised learning models on four recently published benchmark NIDS datasets. Our investigation indicates that none of the considered models is able to generalise over all studied datasets. Interestingly, our results also indicate that the generalisability has a high degree of asymmetry, i.e., swapping the source and target domains can significantly change the classification performance. Our investigation also indicates that overall, unsupervised learning methods generalise better than supervised learning models in our considered scenarios. Using SHAP values to explain these results indicates that the lack of generalisability is mainly due to the presence of strong correspondence between the values of one or more features and Attack/Benign classes in one dataset-model combination and its absence in other datasets that have different feature distributions. △ Less"}

Nowadays, modern vehicles are connected to a range of networks, including intra-vehicle networks and external networks. However, a primary challenge in the automotive industry is to make the vehicle safe and reliable; particularly with the loopholes in the existing traditional protocols, cyber-attacks on the vehicle network are rising drastically. Practically every vehicle uses the universal Controller Area Network (CAN) bus protocol for the communication between electronic control units to transmit key vehicle functionality and messages related to driver safety. The CAN bus system , although its critical significance, lacks the key feature of any protocol authentication and authorization. Resulting in compromises of CAN bus security leads to serious issues to both car and driver safety. This paper discusses the security issues of the CAN bus protocol and proposes an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that detects known attacks on in-vehicle networks. Multiple Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are employed to provide recognition of known potential cyber-attacks based on messages, timestamps, and data packets traveling through the CAN. The main objective of this paper is to accurately detect cyberattacks by considering time-series features and attack frequency. The majority of the evaluated AI algorithms, when considering attack frequency, correctly identify known attacks with remarkable accuracy of more than 99%. However, these models achieve approximately 92% to 97% accuracy when timestamps are not taken into account.

Our paper aims at utilizing this progress made for English to transfers that knowledge into other languages, which is a non-trivial task due to the domain gap between English and the target languages. We propose a black-box non- intrusive method that utilizes techniques from Domain Adaptation to reduce the domain gap, without requiring any human expertise in the target language, by leveraging low-quality data in both a supervised and unsupervised manner. This allows us to rapidly achieve similar results for stance detection for the Zulu language, the target language in this work, as are found for English.

The undetected exploitation of these breaches can bring severe cybersecurity and privacy risks. Anomaly-based \\acp{IDS} play an essential role in network security. In this paper, we present a practical unsupervised anomaly-based deep learning detection system called ARCADE (Adversarially Regularized Convolutional Autoencoder for unsupervised network anomaly DEtection ). With a convolutional \\ac{AE}, ARCADE automatically builds a profile of the normal traffic using a subset of raw bytes of a few initial packets of network flows so that potential network anomalies and intrusions can be efficiently detected before they cause more damage to the network. ARCADE is trained exclusively on normal traffic. An adversarial training strategy is proposed to regularize and decrease the \\ac{AE}'s capabilities to reconstruct network flows that are out-of-the-normal distribution, thereby improving its anomaly detection capabilities. The proposed approach is more effective than state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for network anomaly detection . Even when examining only two initial packets of a network flow, ARCADE can effectively detect malware infection and network attacks.

With the expansion of advanced connectivity features in automobiles and the elevated risks of internal system exposure, the CAN bus is increasingly prone to intrusions and injection attacks. As ordinary injection attacks disrupt the typical timing properties of the CAN data stream, rule-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) can easily detect them. However, advanced attackers can inject false data to the signal/semantic level, while looking innocuous by the pattern/frequency of the CAN messages. The rule-based IDS, as well as the anomaly-based IDS, are built merely on the sequence of CAN messages IDs or just the binary payload data and are less effective in detecting such attacks. Therefore, to detect such intelligent attacks, we propose CANShield, a deep learning-based signal-level intrusion detection framework for the CAN bus. CANShield consists of three modules: a data preprocessing module that handles the high-dimensional CAN data stream at the signal level and parses them into time series suitable for a deep learning model; a data analyzer module consisting of multiple deep autoencoder (AE) networks, each analyzing the time-series data from a different temporal scale and granularity, and finally an attack detection module that uses an ensemble method to make the final decision. Evaluation results on two high-fidelity signal-based CAN attack datasets show the high accuracy and responsiveness of CANShield in detecting advanced intrusion attacks. △ Less"}

However, WSN has been proven to be vulnerable to security breaches, the harsh and unattended deployment of these networks, combined with their constrained resources and the volume of data generated introduce a major security concern. WSN applications are extremely critical, it is essential to build reliable solutions that involve fast and continuous mechanisms for online data stream analysis enabling the detection of attacks and intrusions . In this context, our aim is to develop an intelligent, efficient, and updatable intrusion detection system by applying an important machine learning concept known as ensemble learning in order to improve detection performance. Although ensemble models have been proven to be useful in offline learning, they have received less attention in streaming applications. In this paper, we examine the application of different homogeneous and heterogeneous online ensembles in sensory data analysis, on a specialized wireless sensor network- detection system (WSN-DS) dataset in order to classify four types of attacks: Blackhole attack, Grayhole, Flooding, and Scheduling among normal network traffic.

Accurate frame detection models assist vehicles to avoid malicious attacks. Uncertainty and diversity regarding attack methods make this task challenging. However, the existing works have the limitation of only considering local features or the weak feature mapping of multi-features. To address these limitations, we present a novel model for automotive intrusion detection by spatial-temporal correlation features of in-vehicle communication traffic (STC-IDS). Specifically, the proposed model exploits an encoding- detection architecture. In the encoder part, spatial and temporal relations are encoded simultaneously. To strengthen the relationship between features, the attention-based convolutional network still captures spatial and channel features to increase the receptive field, while attention-LSTM builds meaningful relationships from previous time series or crucial bytes. The encoded information is then passed to detector for generating forceful spatial-temporal attention features and enabling anomaly classification. In particular, single-frame and multi-frame models are constructed to present different advantages respectively. Under automatic hyper-parameter selection based on Bayesian optimization, the model is trained to attain the best performance. Extensive empirical studies based on a real-world vehicle attack dataset demonstrate that STC-IDS has outperformed baseline methods and obtains fewer false-alarm rates while maintaining efficiency. △ Less"}

Unfortunately, DL algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial examples that inject imperceptible modifications to the input and cause the DL algorithm to misclassify the input. Existing adversarial attacks in the NIDS domain often manipulate the traffic features directly, which hold no practical significance because traffic features cannot be replayed in a real network. It remains a research challenge to generate practical and evasive adversarial attacks. This paper presents the Liuer Mihou attack that generates practical and replayable adversarial network packets that can bypass anomaly-based NIDS deployed in the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The core idea behind Liuer Mihou is to exploit adversarial transferability and generate adversarial packets on a surrogate NIDS constrained by predefined mutation operations to ensure practicality. We objectively analyse the evasiveness of Liuer Mihou against four ML-based algorithms (LOF, OCSVM, RRCF, and SOM) and the state-of-the-art NIDS, Kitsune. From the results of our experiment, we gain valuable insights into necessary conditions on the adversarial transferability of anomaly detection algorithms.

Many studies, which are mostly based on machine learning, have proposed installing an intrusion detection system (IDS) for anomaly detection in the CAN bus system . Although machine learning methods have many advantages for IDS, previous models usually require a large amount of labeled data, which results in high time and labor costs. To handle this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning-based convolutional adversarial autoencoder model in this paper. The proposed model combines two popular deep learning models: autoencoder and generative adversarial networks. First, the model is trained with unlabeled data to learn the manifolds of normal and attack patterns. Then, only a small number of labeled samples are used in supervised training. The proposed model can detect various kinds of message injection attacks, such as DoS, fuzzy, and spoofing, as well as unknown attacks. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves the highest F1 score of 0.99 and a low error rate of 0.1\\% with limited labeled data compared to other supervised methods.

With unbalanced data, the predictive models developed using ML algorithms may produce unsatisfactory classifiers which would affect accuracy in predicting intrusions . Traditionally, researchers used over-sampling and under-sampling for balancing data in datasets to overcome this problem. In this work, in addition to over-sampling, we also use a synthetic data generation method, called Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN), to balance data and study their effect on various ML classifiers. To the best of our knowledge, no one else has used CTGAN to generate synthetic samples to balance intrusion detection datasets. Based on extensive experiments using a widely used dataset NSL-KDD, we found that training ML models on dataset balanced with synthetic samples generated by CTGAN increased prediction accuracy by up to $8\\%$, compared to training the same ML models over unbalanced data. Our experiments also show that the accuracy of some ML models trained over data balanced with random over-sampling decline compared to the same ML models trained over unbalanced data. △ Less"}

Recommendation systems are a key component of online service providers. The financial industry has adopted ML to harness large volumes of data in areas such as fraud detection , risk-management, and compliance. Deep Learning is the technology behind voice-based personal assistants, etc. Deployment of ML technologies onto cloud computing infrastructures has benefited numerous aspects of our daily life. The advertising and associated online industries in particular have fuelled a rapid rise the in deployment of personal data collection and analytics tools. Traditionally, behavioural analytics relies on collecting vast amounts of data in centralised cloud infrastructure before using it to train machine learning models that allow user behaviour and preferences to be inferred. A contrasting approach, distributed data analytics, where code and models for training and inference are distributed to the places where data is collected, has been boosted by two recent, ongoing developments: increased processing power and memory capacity available in user devices at the edge of the network, such as smartphones and home assistants; and increased sensitivity to the highly intrusive nature of many of these devices and services and the attendant demands for improved privacy. Indeed, the potential for increased privacy is not the only benefit of distributing data analytics to the edges of the network: reducing the movement of large volumes of data can also improve energy efficiency, helping to ameliorate the ever increasing carbon footprint of our digital infrastructure, enabling much lower latency for service interactions than is possible when services are cloud-hosted. These approaches often introduce challenges in privacy, utility, and efficiency trade-offs, while having to ensure fruitful user engagement. △ Less"}

Machine learning solutions have also been employed in IDSs to detect known and plausible attacks in incoming traffic. Parameters such as packet contents, sender IP and sender port, connection duration, etc. have been previously used to train these machine learning models to learn to differentiate genuine traffic from malicious ones. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been significantly successful in detecting such anomalies, mostly attributed to the adversarial training of the generator and discriminator in an attempt to bypass each other and in turn increase their own power and accuracy. However, in large networks having a wide variety of traffic at possibly different regions of the network and susceptible to a large number of potential attacks, training these GANs for a particular kind of anomaly may make it oblivious to other anomalies and attacks. In addition, the dataset required to train these models has to be made centrally available and publicly accessible, posing the obvious question of privacy of the communications of the respective participants of the network. The solution proposed in this work aims at tackling the above two issues by using GANs in a federated architecture in networks of such scale and capacity. In such a setting, different users of the network will be able to train and customize a centrally available adversarial model according to their own frequently faced conditions. Simultaneously, the member users of the network will also able to gain from the experiences of the other users in the network. △ Less"}

Zero Trust Architecture works on the principle of never granting trust implicitly, but rather continuously evaluating the trust parameters for each resource access request and has a strict, but not rigid, set of protocols for access control of a subject to resources. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems are tools that collect a large number of attributes in and around machines within an enterprise network to have close visibility into sophisticated intrusion . In our work, we seek to deploy EDR systems and build trust algorithms using tactical provenance analysis, threshold cryptography and reputation management to continuously record data, evaluate trust of a subject, and simultaneously analyze them against a database of known threat vectors to provide conditional access control. However, EDR tools generate a high volume of data that leads to false alarms, misdetections and correspondingly a high backlog of tasks that makes it infeasible, which is addressed using tactical provenance analysis and information theory. △ Less"}

Machine learning (ML) nowadays predominantly serves as the basis for NIDS decision making, where models are tuned to reduce false alarms, increase detection rates, and detect known and unknown attacks. At the same time, ML models have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples that undermine the downstream task. In this work, we ask the practical question of whether real-world ML-based NIDS can be circumvented by crafted adversarial flows, and if so, how can they be created. We develop the generative adversarial network (GAN)-based attack algorithm NIDSGAN and evaluate its effectiveness against realistic ML-based NIDS. Two main challenges arise for generating adversarial network traffic flows: (1) the network features must obey the constraints of the domain (i.e., represent realistic network behavior), and (2) the adversary must learn the decision behavior of the target NIDS without knowing its model internals (e.g., architecture and meta-parameters) and training data. Despite these challenges, the NIDSGAN algorithm generates highly realistic adversarial traffic flows that evade ML-based NIDS. We evaluate our attack algorithm against two state-of-the-art DNN-based NIDS in whitebox, blackbox, and restricted-blackbox threat models and achieve success rates which are on average 99%, 85%, and 70%, respectively. We also show that our attack algorithm can evade NIDS based on classical ML models including logistic regression, SVM, decision trees and KNNs, with a success rate of 70% on average. Our results demonstrate that deploying ML-based NIDS without careful defensive strategies against adversarial flows may (and arguably likely will) lead to future compromises. △ Less"}

The number of cyberattacks keeps increasing as Internet usage continues to grow. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an alarm system that helps to detect cyberattacks. As new types of cyberattacks continue to emerge, researchers focus on developing machine learning (ML) based IDS to detect zero-day attacks. Researchers usually remove some or all attack samples from the training dataset and only include them in the testing dataset when evaluating the performance of an IDS on detecting zero-day attacks. Although this method may show the ability of an IDs to detect unknown attacks; however, it does not reflect the long-term performance of the IDS as it only shows the changes in the type of attacks. In this paper, we focus on evaluating the long-term performance of ML based IDS. To achieve this goal, we propose evaluating the ML-based IDS using a dataset that is created later than the training dataset. The proposed method can better assess the long-term performance of an ML-based IDS, as the testing dataset reflects the changes in the type of attack and the changes in network infrastructure over time. We have implemented six of the most popular ML models that are used for IDS, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), naïve Bayes (NB), artificial neural network (ANN) and deep neural network (DNN). Our experiments using the CIC-IDS2017 and the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets show that SVM and ANN are most resistant to overfitting. Besides that, our experiment results also show that DT and RF suffer the most from overfitting, although they perform well on the training dataset. On the other hand, our experiments using the LUFlow dataset have shown that all models can perform well when the difference between the training and testing datasets is small. △ Less"}

Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are another pollutant originating from the occupants. However, a limited number of studies have evaluated the impact of occupants on the VOC level. In this paper, continuous measurements of CO$_2$, VOC, light, temperature, and humidity were recorded in a 17,000 sqft open office space for around four months. Using different statistical models (e.g., SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest) we evaluated which combination of environmental factors provides more accurate insights on occupant presence.

ML-NIDS must be trained and evaluated, operations requiring data where benign and malicious samples are clearly labelled. Such labels demand costly expert knowledge, resulting in a lack of real deployments, as well as on papers always relying on the same outdated data. The situation improved recently, as some efforts disclosed their labelled datasets. However, most past works used such datasets just as a 'yet another' testbed, overlooking the added potential provided by such availability. In contrast, we promote using such existing labelled data to cross-evaluate ML-NIDS. Such approach received only limited attention and, due to its complexity, requires a dedicated treatment. We hence propose the first cross-evaluation model. Our model highlights the broader range of realistic use-cases that can be assessed via cross-evaluations, allowing the discovery of still unknown qualities of state-of-the-art ML-NIDS. For instance, their detection surface can be extended--at no additional labelling cost. However, conducting such cross-evaluations is challenging.

The high number of IoT devices makes them the perfect setup for staging denial-of-service attacks (DoS) that can have devastating consequences. This renders the need for cybersecurity measures such as intrusion detection systems (IDSs) evident. The aim of this paper is to build an IDS using the big data platform, Apache Spark.

Two rounds of tests were performed, a partial dataset for minimizing bias, and the full BoT-IoT dataset for exploring big data and ML capabilities in a security setting. For the partial dataset, the Random Forest algorithm had the highest performance for binary classification at an average f1 measure of 99.7%, as well as 99.6% for main category classification, and an 88.5% f1 measure for sub category classification.

A physical threat monitoring solution unifying the floorplan, cameras, and sensors for smart buildings has been set up in our study. Computer vision and deep learning models are used for video streams analysis. When a threat is detected by a rule engine based on the real-time analysis results combining with feedback from related digital sensors, an alert is sent to the Video Management System so that human operators can take further action. A physical threat monitoring system typically needs to address complex and even destructive incidents, such as fire, which is unrealistic to simulate in real life. Restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic and privacy concerns have added to the challenges. Our study utilises the Unreal Engine to simulate some typical suspicious and intrusion scenes with photorealistic qualities in the context of a virtual building. Add-on programs are implemented to transfer the video stream from virtual PTZ cameras to the Milestone Video Management System and enable users to control those cameras from the graphic client application. Virtual sensors such as fire alarms, temperature sensors and door access controls are implemented similarly, fulfilling the same programmatic VMS interface as real-life sensors. Thanks to this simulation system's extensibility and repeatability, we have consolidated this unified physical threat monitoring system and verified its effectiveness and user-friendliness. Both the simulated Unreal scenes and the software add-ons developed during this study are highly modulated and thereby are ready for reuse in future projects in this area. △ Less"}

Detecting software partial anomalies in complex systems at runtime can assist with handling unintended software behaviors, avoiding catastrophic software failures and improving software runtime availability. These detection techniques aim to identify the manifestation of faults (anomalies) before they ultimately lead to unavoidable failures, thus, supporting the following runtime fault-tolerant techniques. In this work, we propose a novel anomaly detection method named DistAD, which is based on the distribution of software runtime dynamic execution traces. Unlike other existing works using key performance indicators, the execution trace is collected during runtime via intrusive instrumentation. Instrumentation are controlled following a sampling mechanism to avoid excessive overheads. Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), an architecture of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is used to achieve the anomaly detection . The whole framework is constructed under a One-Class Neural Network (OCNN) learning mode which can help eliminate the limits of lacking for enough labeled samples and the data imbalance issues. A series of controlled experiments are conducted on a widely used database system named Cassandra to prove the validity and feasibility of the proposed method. Overheads brought about by the intrusive probing are also evaluated. The results show that DistAD can achieve more than 70% accuracy and 90% recall (in normal states) with no more than 2 times overheads compared with unmonitored executions. △ Less"}

These approaches are however routinely validated with data collected in the same environment, and their performance degrades when deployed in different network topologies and/or applied on previously unseen traffic, as we uncover. This suggests malicious/benign behaviors are largely learned superficially and ML-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) need revisiting, to be effective in practice. In this paper we dive into the mechanics of large-scale network attacks, with a view to understanding how to use ML for Network Intrusion Detection (NID) in a principled way. We reveal that, although cyberattacks vary significantly in terms of payloads, vectors and targets, their early stages, which are critical to successful attack outcomes, share many similarities and exhibit important temporal correlations.

We cross-evaluate NetSentry using two practical datasets, training on one and testing on the other, and demonstrate F1 score gains above 33% over the state-of-the-art, as well as up to 3 times higher rates of detecting attacks such as XSS and web bruteforce.

Additionally, traditional security measures, such as cryptography, are challenging to implement in medical equipment due to the heterogeneous communication and their limited computation, storage, and energy capacity.

Automatic bed-occupancy detection is necessary for automatic long-term cough monitoring, since the time which the monitored patient occupies the bed is required to accurately calculate a cough rate. Accelerometer measurements are more cost effective and less intrusive than alternatives such as video monitoring or pressure sensors. A 249-hour dataset of manually-labelled acceleration signals gathered from seven patients undergoing treatment for tuberculosis (TB) was compiled for experimentation. These signals are characterised by brief activity bursts interspersed with long periods of little or no activity, even when the bed is occupied. To process them effectively, we propose an architecture consisting of three interconnected components. An occupancy-change detector locates instances at which bed occupancy is likely to have changed, an occupancy-interval detector classifies periods between detected occupancy changes and an occupancy-state detector corrects falsely-identified occupancy changes. Using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, this architecture was demonstrated to achieve an AUC of 0.94. When integrated into a complete cough monitoring system , the daily cough rate of a patient undergoing TB treatment was determined over a period of 14 days. As the colony forming unit (CFU) counts decreased and the time to positivity (TPP) increased, the measured cough rate decreased, indicating effective TB treatment. This provides a first indication that automatic cough monitoring based on bed-mounted accelerometer measurements may present a non-invasive, non- intrusive and cost-effective means of monitoring long-term recovery of TB patients. △ Less"}

This means that an IDS would only be able to detect an attack after it has been executed on the system under attack and might have caused damage to the system . In this paper, we propose an end-to-end early intrusion detection system to prevent network attacks before they could cause any more damage to the system under attack while preventing unforeseen downtime and interruption. We employ a deep neural network-based classifier for attack identification. The network is trained in a supervised manner to extract relevant features from raw network traffic data instead of relying on a manual feature selection process used in most related approaches. Further, we introduce a new metric, called earliness, to evaluate how early our proposed approach detects attacks. We have empirically evaluated our approach on the CICIDS2017 dataset. The results show that our approach performed well and attained an overall 0.803 balanced accuracy. △ Less"}

The range is designed to provide agile reconfigurations to facilitate a wide variety of experiments for evaluations of cyber security tools -- particularly those involving AI/ML. In particular, the testbed provides realistic test environments while permitting control and programmatic observations/data collection during the experiments. We have designed in the ability to repeat the evaluations, so additional tools can be evaluated and compared at a later time. The system is one that can be scaled up or down for experiment sizes. At the time of the conference we will have completed two full-scale, national, government challenges on this range. These challenges are evaluating the performance and operating costs for AI/ML-based cyber security tools for application into large, government-sized networks. These evaluations will be described as examples providing motivation and context for various design decisions and adaptations we have made. The first challenge measured end-point security tools against 100K file samples (benignware and malware) chosen across a range of file types. The second is an evaluation of network intrusion detection systems efficacy in identifying multi-step adversarial campaigns -- involving reconnaissance, penetration and exploitations, lateral movement, etc. -- with varying levels of covertness in a high-volume business network. The scale of each of these challenges requires automation systems to repeat, or simultaneously mirror identical the experiments for each ML tool under test. Providing an array of easy-to-difficult malicious activity for sussing out the true abilities of the AI/ML tools has been a particularly interesting and challenging aspect of designing and executing these challenge events. △ Less"}

From cleaning houses to providing guidance and emotional support, robots now work directly with humans. Due to their far-reaching applications and progressively complex architecture, they are being targeted by adversarial attacks such as sensor-actuator attacks, data spoofing, malware, and network intrusion . Therefore, security for robotic systems has become crucial. In this paper, we address the underserved area of malware detection in robotic software. Since robots work in close proximity to humans, often with direct interactions, malware could have life-threatening impacts. Hence, we propose the RoboMal framework of static malware detection on binary executables to detect malware before it gets a chance to execute. Additionally, we address the great paucity of data in this space by providing the RoboMal dataset comprising controller executables of a small-scale autonomous car. The performance of the framework is compared against widely used supervised learning models: GRU, CNN, and ANN. Notably, the LSTM-based RoboMal model outperforms the other models with an accuracy of 85% and precision of 87% in 10-fold cross-validation, hence proving the effectiveness of the proposed framework. △ Less"}

HIDS is widely adopted in the industry as HIDS is ranked among the top two most used security tools by Security Operation Centers (SOC) of organizations. Although effective and efficient HIDS is highly desirable for industrial organizations, the evolution of increasingly complex attack patterns causes several challenges resulting in performance degradation of HIDS (e.g., high false alert rate creating alert fatigue for SOC staff). Since Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods are better suited for identifying complex attack patterns, an increasing number of HIDS are leveraging the advances in NLP that have shown effective and efficient performance in precisely detecting low footprint, zero day attacks and predicting the next steps of attackers. This active research trend of using NLP in HIDS demands a synthesized and comprehensive body of knowledge of NLP based HIDS. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on the end to end pipeline of the use of NLP in HIDS development. For the end to end NLP based HIDS development pipeline, we identify, taxonomically categorize and systematically compare the state of the art of NLP methods usage in HIDS, attacks detected by these NLP methods, datasets and evaluation metrics which are used to evaluate the NLP based HIDS. We highlight the relevant prevalent practices, considerations, advantages and limitations to support the HIDS developers.

Electronic Control Units (ECUs) exchange data across a shared bus, dropping messages whenever errors occur. If an ECU generates enough errors, their transmitter is put in a bus-off state, turning it off. Previous work abuses this process to disable ECUs, but is trivial to detect through the multiple errors transmitted over the bus. We propose a novel attack, undetectable by prior intrusion detection systems , which disables ECUs within a single message without generating any errors on the bus. Performing this attack requires the ability to flip bits on the bus, but not with any level of sophistication. We show that an attacker who can only flip bits 40% of the time can execute our stealthy attack 100% of the time. But this attack, and all prior CAN attacks, rely on the ability to read the bus. We propose a new technique which synchronizes the bus, such that even a blind attacker, incapable of reading the bus, can know when to transmit. Taking a limited attacker's chance of success from the percentage of dead bus time, to 100%. Finally, we propose a small modification to the CAN error process to ensure an ECU cannot fail without being detected , no matter how advanced the attacker is.

Since the cyber landscape is an ever-evolving scenario, one must keep upgrading its security systems to enhance the security of the infrastructure. Tools like Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), Information Technology Service Management (ITSM), along with other defensive techniques like Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Intrusion Protection System (IPS), and many others enhance the cyber security posture of the infrastructure. However, the proposed protection mechanisms have their limitations, they are insufficient to ensure security, and the attacker penetrates the network. Deception technology, along with Honeypots, provides a false sense of vulnerability in the target systems to the attackers. The attacker deceived reveals threat intel about their modus operandi. We have developed a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) Engine that dynamically deploys custom honeypots inside the internal network infrastructure based on the attacker's behavior. The architecture is robust enough to support multiple VLANs connected to the system and used for orchestration.

The growing reliance on the use of social media networks worldwide has resulted in great concern for information security. One of the factors popularizing the social media platforms is how they connect people worldwide to interact, share content, and engage in mutual interactions of common interest that cut across geographical boundaries. Behind all these incredible gains are digital crime equivalence that threatens the physical socialization. Criminal-minded elements and hackers are exploiting Social Media Platforms (SMP) for many nefarious activities to harm others. As detection tools are developed to control these crimes, hackers' tactics and techniques are constantly evolving. Hackers are constantly developing new attacking tools and hacking strategies to gain malicious access to systems and attack social media network thereby making it difficult for security administrators and organizations to develop and implement the proper policies and procedures necessary to prevent the hackers' attacks. The increase in cyber-attacks on the social media platforms calls for urgent and more intelligent security measures to enhance the effectiveness of social media platforms.

On the other hand, due to the limited resources of wireless nodes, the use of monitoring nodes for permanent monitoring in wireless sensor networks in order to prevent and detect intrusion and attacks in this type of network is practically non-existent. Therefore, the solution to overcome this problem today is the discussion of remote-control systems and has become one of the topics of interest in various fields. Remote monitoring of node performance and behavior in wireless sensor networks, in addition to detecting malicious nodes within the network, can also predict malicious node behavior in future. In present research, a network intrusion detection system using feature selection based on a combination of Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and genetic algorithm (GA) and sample-based classification is proposed.

PRISM has a unique multi-layered architecture that monitors network traffic distributedly to provide efficiency in processing and modularity in design.

The aim of system log anomaly detection is to promptly identify anomalies while minimizing human intervention, which is a critical problem in the industry. Previous studies performed anomaly detection through algorithms after converting various forms of log data into a standardized template using a parser. Particularly, a template corresponding to a specific event should be defined in advance for all the log data using which the information within the log key may get lost. In this study, we propose LAnoBERT, a parser free system log anomaly detection method that uses the BERT model, exhibiting excellent natural language processing performance. The proposed method, LAnoBERT, learns the model through masked language modeling, which is a BERT-based pre-training method, and proceeds with unsupervised learning-based anomaly detection using the masked language modeling loss function per log key during the test process.

However, current efforts mostly focus on specific domains and protocols, leading to a research landscape broken up into isolated silos. Thus, existing approaches cannot be applied to other industries that would equally benefit from powerful detection . To better understand this issue, we survey 53 detection systems and find no fundamental reason for their narrow focus. Although they are often coupled to specific industrial protocols in practice, many approaches could generalize to new industrial scenarios in theory. To unlock this potential, we propose IPAL, our industrial protocol abstraction layer, to decouple intrusion detection from domain-specific industrial protocols.

In this work, we propose TOD, the first tensor-based system for efficient and scalable outlier detection on distributed multi-GPU machines. A key idea behind TOD is decomposing complex OD applications into a small collection of basic tensor algebra operators. This decomposition enables TOD to accelerate OD computations by leveraging recent advances in deep learning infrastructure in both hardware and software. Moreover, to deploy memory-intensive OD applications on modern GPUs with limited on-device memory, we introduce two key techniques. First, provable quantization speeds up OD computations and reduces its memory footprint by automatically performing specific floating-point operations in lower precision while provably guaranteeing no accuracy loss. Second, to exploit the aggregated compute resources and memory capacity of multiple GPUs, we introduce automatic batching, which decomposes OD computations into small batches for both sequential execution on a single GPU and parallel execution on multiple GPUs. TOD supports a diverse set of OD algorithms. Extensive evaluation on 11 real and 3 synthetic OD datasets shows that TOD is on average 10.9x faster than the leading CPU-based OD system PyOD (with a maximum speedup of 38.9x), and can handle much larger datasets than existing GPU-based OD systems .

The system achieves 90.02\\% accuracy when using an MLP to discriminate between 51 coughers using 2-sec long cough segments in the noisy environment. When discriminating between 5 and 14 coughers using longer (100 sec) segments in the quiet environment, this accuracy improves to 99.78% and 98.39% respectively.

To deal with this reality, the open set recognition field, which is the most general task of recognizing classes not seen during training in any domain, began to gain importance in NIDS research. Yet, existing solutions are often bounded to high temporal complexities and performance bottlenecks. In this work, we propose an algorithm to be used in NIDS that performs open set recognition.

This paper comprehensively analyses feature sets' importance and predictive power for detecting network attacks. Three feature selection algorithms: chi-square, information gain and correlation, have been utilised to identify and rank data features. The attributes are fed into two ML classifiers: deep feed-forward and random forest, to measure their attack detection performance. The experimental evaluation considered three datasets: UNSW-NB15, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, and ToN-IoT in their proprietary flow format. In addition, the respective variants in NetFlow format were also considered, i.e., NF-UNSW-NB15, NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, and NF-ToN-IoT.

Our results show that the accuracy initially increases rapidly with adding features but converges quickly to the maximum.

However, these datasets are different in feature sets, attack types, and network design. Therefore, this paper aims to discover whether these techniques can be generalised across various datasets. Six ML models are utilised: a Deep Feed Forward (DFF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), and Naive Bayes (NB). The accuracy of three Feature Extraction (FE) algorithms; Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Auto-encoder (AE), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), are evaluated using three benchmark datasets: UNSW-NB15, ToN-IoT and CSE-CIC-IDS2018. Although PCA and AE algorithms have been widely used, the determination of their optimal number of extracted dimensions has been overlooked. The results indicate that no clear FE method or ML model can achieve the best scores for all datasets. The optimal number of extracted dimensions has been identified for each dataset, and LDA degrades the performance of the ML models on two datasets. The variance is used to analyse the extracted dimensions of LDA and PCA. Finally, this paper concludes that the choice of datasets significantly alters the performance of the applied techniques.

In order to protect data leakage and reduce networking redundancy, we then proposed a privacy-preserved inference protocol via Packed Homomorphic Encryption and a sliding window protocol in our system . The classification accuracy and processing time were measured, and the proposed classifier outperformed a baseline classifier, especially against unseen patterns. We also demonstrated that the distributed CNN design is secure against any distributed components. Overall, the measurements were shown to the feasibility of our real-time distributed system for intrusion detection on IoT devices. △ Less"}

Those contain crucial information which are subject to various analyses. Examples range from cybersecurity, intrusion detection over usage analyses to trouble shooting. Before data analysis is possible, desired information needs to be extracted first out of the semi-structured log messages. State-of-the-art event parsing often assumes static log events. However, any modern system is updated consistently and with updates also log file structures can change. We call those changes \"mutation\" and study parsing performance for different mutation cases. Latest research discovers mutations using anomaly detection post mortem, however, does not cover actual continuous parsing. Thus, we propose a novel and flexible parser, called FlexParser, which can extract desired values despite gradual changes in the log messages. It implies basic text preprocessing followed by a supervised Deep Learning method. We train a stateful LSTM on parsing one event per data set. Statefulness enforces the model to learn log message structures across several examples. Our model was tested on seven different, publicly available log file data sets and various kinds of mutations. Exhibiting an average F1-Score of 0.98, it outperforms other Deep Learning methods as well as state-of-the-art unsupervised parsers. △ Less"}

GNNs are a relatively new sub-field of deep neural networks, which can leverage the inherent structure of graph-based data. Training and evaluation data for NIDSs are typically represented as flow records, which can naturally be represented in a graph format. In this paper, we propose E-GraphSAGE, a GNN approach that allows capturing both the edge features of a graph as well as the topological information for network intrusion detection in IoT networks. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first successful, practical, and extensively evaluated approach of applying GNNs on the problem of network intrusion detection for IoT using flow-based data. Our extensive experimental evaluation on four recent NIDS benchmark datasets shows that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of key classification metrics, which demonstrates the potential of GNNs in network intrusion detection , and provides motivation for further research. △ Less"}

By building a statistical model of usual activity, it aims to detect multiple kinds of malicious behavior, including stealthy tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) designed to evade signature-based detection systems . However, finding suitable anomaly detection methods for event logs remains an important challenge. This results from the very complex, multi-faceted nature of the data: event logs are not only combinatorial, but also temporal and heterogeneous data, thus they fit poorly in most theoretical frameworks for anomaly detection . Most previous research focuses on either one of these three aspects, building a simplified representation of the data that can be fed to standard anomaly detection algorithms. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously address all three of these characteristics through a specifically tailored statistical model. We introduce \\textsc{Decades}, a \\underline{d}ynamic, h\\underline{e}terogeneous and \\underline{c}ombinatorial model for \\underline{a}nomaly \\underline{d}etection in \\underline{e}vent \\underline{s}treams, and we demonstrate its effectiveness at detecting malicious behavior through experiments on a real dataset containing labelled red team activity.

Despite superior detection accuracy, existing machine learning or deep learning based NIDS are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become a prevailing method in adversarial examples crafting. However, the nature of discrete network traffic at the packet level makes it hard for GAN to craft adversarial traffic as GAN is efficient in generating continuous data like image synthesis. Unlike previous methods that convert discrete network traffic into a grayscale image, this paper gains inspiration from SeqGAN in sequence generation with policy gradient. Based on the structure of SeqGAN, we propose Attack-GAN to generate adversarial network traffic at packet level that complies with domain constraints. Specifically, the adversarial packet generation is formulated into a sequential decision making process. In this case, each byte in a packet is regarded as a token in a sequence. The objective of the generator is to select a token to maximize its expected end reward. To bypass the detection of NIDS, the generated network traffic and benign traffic are classified by a black-box NIDS. The prediction results returned by the NIDS are fed into the discriminator to guide the update of the generator. We generate malicious adversarial traffic based on a real public available dataset with attack functionality unchanged. The experimental results validate that the generated adversarial samples are able to deceive many existing black-box NIDS. △ Less"}

We show that it is possible to develop a flow based network intrusion detection system based on machine learning entirely in eBPF. Our solution uses a decision tree and decides for each packet whether it is malicious or not, considering the entire previous context of the network flow. We achieve a performance increase of over 20% compared to the same solution implemented as a userspace program. △ Less"}

To our knowledge, RePAD (Real-time Proactive Anomaly Detection algorithm) is a generic approach with all above-mentioned features. To achieve real-time and lightweight detection , RePAD utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to detect whether or not each upcoming data point is anomalous based on short-term historical data points. However, it is unclear that how different amounts of historical data points affect the performance of RePAD. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the impact of different amounts of historical data on RePAD by introducing a set of performance metrics that cover novel detection accuracy measures, time efficiency, readiness, and resource consumption, etc. Empirical experiments based on real-world time series datasets are conducted to evaluate RePAD in different scenarios, and the experimental results are presented and discussed. △ Less"}

Other security analysts use this intelligence to inform them of indicators of compromise, attack techniques, and preventative actions. Security analysts prepare threat analysis reports after investigating an attack, an emerging cyber threat, or a recently discovered vulnerability. Collectively known as cyber threat intelligence (CTI), the reports are typically in an unstructured format and, therefore, challenging to integrate seamlessly into existing intrusion detection systems . This paper proposes a framework that uses the aggregated CTI for analysis and defense at scale. The information is extracted and stored in a structured format using knowledge graphs such that the semantics of the threat intelligence can be preserved and shared at scale with other security analysts. Specifically, we propose the first semi-supervised open-source knowledge graph-based framework, TINKER, to capture cyber threat information and its context.

To this end, this paper presents a flexible and extendable in-vessel testbed for flow-based macroscopic MC, abstractly modeling, e.g., a part of a chemical reactor or a blood vessel. Signaling is based on injecting non-reactive superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) dispersed in an aqueous suspension into a tube with background flow. A commercial magnetic susceptometer is used for non- intrusive downstream signal reception. To shed light on the operation of the testbed, we identify the physical mechanisms governing the transmission, propagation, and reception of the information-carrying SPIONs. Moreover, to facilitate system design, we propose a closed-form parametric expression for the end-to-end channel impulse response (CIR). The proposed CIR model is shown to consistently capture the experimentally observed distance-dependent impulse response peak heights and peak decays for transmission distances from 5cm to 40cm. Moreover, to validate our testbed, reliable communication is demonstrated based on experimental data for model-agnostic and model-based detection methods. △ Less"}

Supervised ML is based upon learning by example, demanding significant volumes of representative instances for effective training and the need to re-train the model for every unseen cyber-attack class. However, retraining the models in-situ renders the network susceptible to attacks owing to the time-window required to acquire a sufficient volume of data. Although anomaly detection systems provide a coarse-grained defence against unseen attacks, these approaches are significantly less accurate and suffer from high false-positive rates. Here, a complementary approach referred to as 'One-Shot Learning', whereby a limited number of examples of a new attack-class is used to identify a new attack-class (out of many) is detailed. The model grants a new cyber-attack classification without retraining. A Siamese Network is trained to differentiate between classes based on pairs similarities, rather than features, allowing to identify new and previously unseen attacks. The performance of a pre-trained model to classify attack-classes based only on one example is evaluated using three datasets. Results confirm the adaptability of the model in classifying unseen attacks and the trade-off between performance and the need for distinctive class representation. △ Less"}

However, applications of machine learning in network security face a more disproportionate threat of active adversarial attacks compared to other domains. This is because machine learning applications in network security such as malware detection , intrusion detection , and spam filtering are by themselves adversarial in nature. In what could be considered an arm's race between attackers and defenders, adversaries constantly probe machine learning systems with inputs that are explicitly designed to bypass the system and induce a wrong prediction. In this survey, we first provide a taxonomy of machine learning techniques, tasks, and depth. We then introduce a classification of machine learning in network security applications. Next, we examine various adversarial attacks against machine learning in network security and introduce two classification approaches for adversarial attacks in network security. First, we classify adversarial attacks in network security based on a taxonomy of network security applications. Secondly, we categorize adversarial attacks in network security into a problem space vs feature space dimensional classification model. We then analyze the various defenses against adversarial attacks on machine learning-based network security applications. We conclude by introducing an adversarial risk grid map and evaluating several existing adversarial attacks against machine learning in network security using the risk grid map. We also identify where each attack classification resides within the adversarial risk grid map. △ Less"}

Nowadays, with the help of machine learning algorithms, intrusion detection systems develop rapidly. However, the robustness of this system is questionable when it faces adversarial attacks. For the robustness of detection systems , more potential attack approaches are under research. In this paper, a framework of the generative adversarial networks, called IDSGAN, is proposed to generate the adversarial malicious traffic records aiming to attack intrusion detection systems by deceiving and evading the detection . Given that the internal structure and parameters of the detection system are unknown to attackers, the adversarial attack examples perform the black-box attacks against the detection system . IDSGAN leverages a generator to transform original malicious traffic records into adversarial malicious ones. A discriminator classifies traffic examples and dynamically learns the real-time black-box detection system . More significantly, the restricted modification mechanism is designed for the adversarial generation to preserve original attack functionalities of adversarial traffic records. The effectiveness of the model is indicated by attacking multiple algorithm-based detection models with different attack categories. The robustness is verified by changing the number of the modified features. A comparative experiment with adversarial attack baselines demonstrates the superiority of our model. △ Less"}
