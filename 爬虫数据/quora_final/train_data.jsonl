You are also less likely to fall and hurt yourself.\n \nThe two main muscle groups used daily are the lower body and the upper body pulling action. The third group is the upper body pushing action. Very seldom used but you can also do the workout if you want to.\n \nForget all the various types of workouts you can do. Just stick to the simplest that you can groove in and do in your sleep.\n \nThe body weight squat is sufficient for the lower body strength. There is also the need to increase stair climbing ability and endurance. A low stool is a good point to start. Then onto a sturdy chair as you improve. Do this in conjunction with the body squat. It prepares the body when you switch from walking and then climbing stairs.\n \nLower back extensions will cover the upper body pulling action. The most basic is bending forward while trying to touch the toes and then straightening up. It sounds simple but it is NOT. The SPINE must be kept in the neutral position ALL the time. It forces the lower back muscles to do most of the work and thus you will get the proper adaptation. A more advanced and more strength adaptation workout is in the image below.\nPull ups will build arm and related muscles.\n \nPush ups are enough for the pushing group of muscles.\n \nThe agility, balance and cardiovascular part is taken care of by doing rope skipping or rope jumping, whatever the term. For the average person, it is equivalent to running for the same length of time in terms of energy usage if you are looking at weight loss as well.\n \nThe only problem you will face is that it is NOT easy at first. If you target say 30 minutes, I doubt you can even do the two leg version for 10 minutes. Your legs will start to burn. That is the alert to stop. Just do the one leg after the other version at slow speed. Stop and rest when you are alerted. Then continue until you reach the 30 minutes. As you improve, increase speed and slowly build up until you can do the two leg version continously for your target duration. Rope skipping, especially on two legs involve the toes, the ankles and calves mainly. The thigh muscle do only a bit of work. Hardly any stress on the knees as the angle of bend is small. So no fear of knee injury.\n \nNot much more to add except to point out a few things. The rope skipping will most probably bring you up to around 80% of max. This is because you are working at just below the leg burning stage. That level is enough for a fairly high level of cardiovascular adaptation if done for a long enough duration and period.

For several summers I worked in a museum gift shop in a small town in Canada, near the US border. It gets hot in Southern Alberta in the summer, this particular day around 35 degrees which I believe is somewhere around 90 degrees Fahrenheit. There is a very large particular religious contingent in Southern Alberta, so most stores aren’t open on Sunday. We were the first stop in Canada for a large tour group from the Southeastern U.S. who had all flown to Great Falls, Montana and picked up a large bus. Well, about 15 of them came in in sweaters, and long pants, socks and shoes/boots and started buying up our very overpriced shorts and t-shirts and flip flops in relatively large quantities. They all assumed it would be snowing and freezing cold in southern Canada- in August! We’re farther south than than mos northern parts of Maine, but okay! Even if you don’ t know a lot about Canada….wouldn’t you at least look up what to wear while there? Our national animal is a beaver, not a polar bear! Even the farthest inhabited areas are still quite warm in summer!", "authorship": "human"}

They are versatile and even portable.\n \nSo, let’s get into it.\n \nIn order to shorten this answer and not repeat myself, I won’t write about basic bodyweight training. Here’s an answer where I go in depth about this:\n \nLazar Nikolic's answer to What is the best way to build muscles at home?\n \nFirst of all, if you don’t have a\n pull-up bar\n, these dumbbells might come in handy – curl variations (for biceps), dumbbell rows (narrow for lats, wider for rear delts) etc. But I highly suggest you try to save up for a pull-up bar, or at least find one in your neighborhood. Or use something else that’s strong enough for you to hold onto. Pull-ups are one of the staples of bodyweight training.\n \nThis leads us to another point from the previous answer: muscles you can’t easily target without equipment. \nCalves\n, for example, are used to the weight of your body, but using 20 kg of dumbbells as a resistance just might create initial overload. Don’t try to exercise your \nmiddle delts\n with these, though. I’m almost certain you won’t be able to handle so much weight in a side lateral raise.\n \nBut, the beauty of dumbbells is this – you can make any exercise harder or easier with these. Let’s take this paragraph from the linked answer:\nMix push-ups and dips for the chest, front shoulders and triceps\nMix pull-ups and chin-ups for lats, biceps, rear delts and the upper back\nMix variations of leg raises, planks and crunches for abs and obliques\nDo lower back extensions for the lower back (spinal erectors)\nMix hip thrusts and glute bridges for the gluteus\nMix squats and lunges for quads\nYou can put a dumbbell (or both) in a backpack and create more tension on \ndips\n, \npush-ups \nor a \nplank\n. You can use one or both in \nsquats\n and \nlunges\n easily. You can make both \nhip thrusts\n and \nglute bridges\n harder with dumbbell(s). And you can hold one or both while doing \ncrunches \nor even hold one of them between legs in \npull-ups\n and\n leg raises\n when you get strong enough.\n \nBut making things harder is in perspective, first you need to create a strong base and develop proper form if you intend on adding weight. That’s where we start looking at things from a different perspective.\n \nIf \npush-ups\n are too hard, use dumbbells to do a \ndumbbell bench press\n. You don’t even need a bench, lay on the floor.\n \nHandstand push-ups\n are one of the best shoulder building exercises. But that’s way too hard, even for more experienced individuals. So, how to get there? Well, you can go through push-up progressions, but you can also strengthen these muscles doing \ndumbbell overhead press\n. In the beginning, use only one dumbbell and switch to both when you develop adequate strength. Just make sure you are familiar with proper form.\n \nIn the beginning, you probably won’t be able to \ncurl \n10 kg effectively either. So, again – use only one dumbbell. If that’s the case, that is.\n \nSo, in short – if you pair your two dumbbells with bodyweight training, you can definitely build more than enough muscle.\n \nI suggest you head off to \nAthlean-X\n YouTube channel and learn proper form of any exercise you want to do. You can also find great insight on \nCalisthenic Movement\n and\n FitnessFAQs\n YouTube channels.\n \nLearn new variations, both easier and harder, if you want to have a good, stable base for future training. Develop your whole body and stretch, so you don’t injure yourself.\n \nDon’t chase numbers, do your absolute best on every exercise and you’ll have results. Just make sure that you can safely do anything you set your mind to. Again – \nstudy proper form in detail before attempting anything\n.\n \nGood luck!\n \nEDIT\n: In some other answers, people said that these dumbbells will eventually get too light for you. That certainly is true. But, with good \nbodyweight variations\n, you can mitigate this “problem”. You can also change the way you move them in space –\n slow down\n, do \none and a half rep\n style training, do \n21's technique\n and more. Yes, expanding your equipment inventory would be beneficial, but that’s so far ahead of you that you don’t have to worry about that now. Cheers!", "authorship": "human"}

Pick a time that you can do the most consistently, then worry about 'optimizing' if at all.\nI'm going to address a few fallacies I've skimmed over so far, then I'll get to the meat of my answer in terms of what really matters.\n \n1 - Working out doesn't 'jump-start' your metabolism. Exercise certainly \nadds\n \nadditional energy output\n as it relates to metabolism (See: \nWhat are the best ways to recover or improve my metabolism?\n) but that doesn't mean 'jumpstart.' Being awake in the first place burns more energy, eating a meal burns energy, but they don't 'jumpstart' metabolism either. They just contribute to daily energy expenditure.\n \nThe same amount and type of exercise done at a different part of the day will essentially have the same effect on your metabolism overall.\n \nIt does generally improve mood and energy though. Especially at moderate intensities (aerobic exercise for instance).\n \n2 - Not everybody 'feels' energized \nall day\n from exercising in the morning (\nI certainly don't\n), the boost it provides to energy/mood is usually only as short as a few hours. It also takes roughly 3 hours for body temperature to increase to highly functioning levels anyway, so you might get an endorphin boost until temperature levels hit peak, that carries you through to the early afternoon (\nso a good portion of the day\n) but most people will still experience a lull in early afternoon (1-2 PM-ish), despite exercising in the morning. \n \nYou might actually do better exercising just before lull that to reduce it's impact. And for other reasons I'll get to below...\n \n3 - Exercise does increase memory retention and cognitive function, but these benefits are not limited to a window of 4-10 hours. Exercising in the morning doesn't increase this benefit according to any research I'm familiar with. Furthermore, you wouldn't be wasting those benefits even if there was such a window as most long-term memory retention and cognitive improvement benefits happen during sleep. \n \nRead \nSpark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain\n, but I don't remember it indicating such a window, nor any of the research I read following it up; If anything, closer to exercise would still be better for the several studies done on how subjects perform better on tests done very soon after exercise. The effects on the brain overall however, appear to stick quite well no matter the time.\n \n4 - If you work early in the morning, then it might absolutely be a problem to get up 30-60 minutes before that. I used to start my work day at 6 AM, up at five, technically when I should be in my deepest sleep, now I'm supposed to get up 30-60 before that? So 4-4:30...which means getting to bed at 8-8:30 PM to get eight hours of sleep, which is generally just after when circadian rhythm makes most people the most alert. \n \nFor anyone other than true larks (small percentage of the population), this is a very daunting task. Sure if you start your work day at 9 AM, getting up at 7 to do a quick workout before work might not be so tough and it might often be better for a lot of folks to get it out of the way before their day gets away from them. Mental fatigue from many decisions throughout the day can make it tough to get to the gym after work for A LOT of people, if it isn't already a routine.\n \nHowever, all of this doesn't make it the best or worst time to train, it totally depends on you the person. Your existing routines, your natural circadian rhythm bias (some are larks, some are night owls, most are in between), your work schedule, your family schedule, etc...etc...\nFor more details on how to discover something that works for you then I highly recommend you read these (disclaimer: My Blog...):\n \nHelp! When Should I Train? (Part I) - Skill Based Fitness\n \n \nHelp! When Should I Train? (Part II) - Skill Based Fitness\n \nFirst, generally speaking consistency matters more than anything else. So if you can make yourself more consistent by getting up in the morning and get it out of the way, then sure that would make working out in the morning better...\nfor you...\n \nThis still wouldn't make it better for everyone else.\n \nThat's first and foremost the most important thing; Training at a time that works for you.\n \nIt is easier for a lot of people to skip workouts later in the day and so working out in the morning does often work very well for a lot of people, \nbut physiologically that doesn't make it ideal. \nAnd it doesn't have to be\n immediately\n upon waking either, just enough time to get it done before you get into a lot of cognitive loading work that might later hinder your ability to desire to go to the gym in the first place. It's the same reason productivity gurus tell you to get your most cognitive tasks out of the way early in the day. \n \nActually there may actually be some inherent risks to training within the first 3 hours of waking, particularly if you are say lifting weight or doing explosive work. Less so for endurance/aerobic training.\n \nFrom sleeping all night (horizontal position), the fluid in your spine actually displaces, slightly destabilizing your spine for the first part of the day. This might be associated with injury potential (at least for heavily loaded movements involving the spine). Not only that but nervous system function, muscular blood flow, glucose metabolism and joint mobility at this time of day aren't really that conducive to training.  All of them are limited first in the morning, which is why most world records in sports are not broken first thing in the morning, they are generally broken in early evening.\n \nYou'd be hard pressed to find many strength or power athletes that successfully do the bulk of their training early in the morning (\nsome will start at 10-11 AM\n). There may be some early morning skates, serving practice or shooting practice, but these are usually low intensity and/or optimized to suit the schedules of student-athletes and break up the training day (\nfor twice-a-day training purposes\n).\n \nThis generally doesn't apply as heavily to the endurance athletes, who often have early start times to deal with mid-afternoon heat, but they would probably still perform better if it was done in the early evening (\nit would just be hotter out still in many climates\n). \n \nAgain schedules optimized to the person and the objective, not necessarily the physiological optimized times.\n \nA physiologically optimized (i.e. derive the most benefit from for performance purposes and anabolism) training window for most people (\ndepending on their circadian rhythm\n) is probably anywhere from about 2:30-3 PM in the afternoon (\njust after your circadian dip\n) to about 6:30-7 PM at night. \n \nYes peak circadian rhythm in most people is closer to 8, which is when you might be inclined or think to be ideal. However, training late generally makes it difficult to fall asleep for 2-3 hours post-workout due to hormone fluctuations, so the later in the day you push it the longer you might end staying up. I used to have volleyball practice from 9-11PM in school, and I could never fall asleep before 1AM as a result, which wrecked havoc on my school schedule.\n \nAgain, here \nI am\n speaking from a fairly pure physiological point of view, if you can't do that, or it impedes you from actually training, you're better off doing what makes you the most consistent. The differences are probably physiologically negligible (I'm throwing out a guess of less than 10-15% difference) long-term, except training first thing in the morning is actually pretty terrible for performance purposes (\nwhich isn't necessarily the same as training...\n). It would also probably increase training injury risk slightly for weight training/explosive training. \n \nIt would on the other hand make sense if you competed early in the morning, to move your training to early in the morning to acclimatize for your performances.\n \nTypically if performance is required or the intensity of training is high, wait at least 3 hours, and maybe even preferably six if you can. If it's just aerobic exercise, endurance, then do it whenever is convenient.\n \nThere are other influencers too. For instance if you have a high stress, high cognitive load job (lawyer, doctor, entrepreneur, technician, engineer, etc...) then you might be more likely to skip training the later in the day you leave it. If you have a lower cognitive load job (autopilot repetitive tasks, manual labour, factory work, etc...) then you might have the mental reserve to better tolerate training later in the day.\n \nUltimately, the best time to work out during the day depends on you.", "authorship": "human"}

Lots and lots of them, literally from every country around the world.\n \nBy American, Canadian or British standards I am poor, but by living standards in other countries such as India or Pakistan I am wealthy. It’s all relative.\n \nBy Brazilian standards, which is where I live, I am… let’s put it this way… very comfortable.\n \nInternet service at home costs me R$147.00 (US$30.00) a month. That’s for a velocity of over 700 megabytes per second, which is really fast, and there’s no limit to how much I can upload or download.\n \nBut for many Brazilians, that’s really expensive, it’s 10% of their monthly salary for 2/3 of the population. So for the majority of the country internet access isn’t cheap.\n \nInternet service on my phone is R$60.00 (US$12.00) a month. It gives me 22 gigabytes of 4g before my connection speed is reduced to 32k, which works well for text emailing, but that’s about it.\n \nThis price also gives me unlimited calling and unlimited text messages to any landline or cellular phone in Brazil independent of who their or my cellular provider is.\n \nIt’s accompanied with free inter-state roaming, and because it’s a pre-paid plan it’s not linked to the purchase of a phone, so really, it’s not a bad deal.\n \nYet, that still means that a family of four, with both parents working minimum wage jobs, as over 1/2 the country does, is paying R$387.00 (US$78.00) a month for internet and cellular services.\n \nWhen a family makes R$2500.00 (US$500.00) a month, that’s close to 18% of their income, that’s a lot.\n \nNow add in the cost of the phones, which are often financed for two years at interest rates of 10% a month which is 420% a year, yes, you read that right, 420%.\n \nBorrowing money in Brazil is comparable to borrowing money from the mafia in other countries, yet so many people do it, because they want an internet connection.\n \nAnd add in the cost of things like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney and Apple+ on family plans, which aren’t expensive in Brazil, all four cost R$75.00 (US$15.00) a month, much less than in many other countries.\n \nStill, it’s easy to see that for many Brazilians access to the internet is expensive, for half the country it literally affects the amount of food you can eat and what neighborhood you can afford to live in.\n \nSo, yes, there are poor people on Quora, even if internet services in Brazil are 20% of the price they are in the United States.\n \nThe other answers I have read to this question also say the same thing. For a large percentage of people, the internet isn’t cheap.", "authorship": "human"}

However, this isn't true of CLion, which \ncan be very helpful\n right off the bat. Let's run through some of the advantages of using CLion:\n \nCLion makes it easy to start a new project. The wizard will generate a simple project structure with stub code that you can explore and run right away.\n \nThen, as you start writing code, CLion will highlight its structure and suggest improvements. This allows you to learn both the language itself and the best code practices from the very beginning.\n \nFor many error cases, CLion suggests quick-fixes, which means you can start memorizing the proper solutions right off the bat. For example, the IDE catches typical errors like dangling pointers – the types of errors that might pop up a lot when you’re a newbie but can also be hard to debug.\n \nThe building, running, and debugging processes are completely transparent, as are VCS operations. You can control every step, see the exact commands, parameters, and flags that are being used, and experiment with them. If necessary, you can always perform the same actions in the built-in terminal.\n \nCLion allows you to become familiar with a variety of compilers and build systems. It works with gcc, Clang, MSVC compilers, and project formats, such as CMake, Makefile, Meson, and others.\n \nUnderstanding the underlying assembly is important when you’re learning a language like C++. CLion allows you to examine the assembly of a file without having to build the entire project. You can change the compiler flags, refresh the assembly view, and see the effect immediately.\n \nAnd, of course, the IDE debugger is very convenient for learning. The IDE will help you investigate any runtime problem, including those that require memory analysis and disassembly.\n \nTo summarize, CLion will not overwhelm you with a complex set-up process and will not hide the essentials in the background. You’ll be able to get up and running with a project in no time, while learning best code practices and efficient debugging right out of the gate.\n \nAnd if you’re a student, you can get it all for free!", "authorship": "human"}

{"Article Number": 993, "title": "Is it bad to do full body workouts every day?", "article": "How do you get the best results possible with the least time invested?\n \nFull-body workouts.\nIf you are a beginner do them twice per week, and if you are intermediate or advance then you can do them three times per week.\n \nI would also add in that another great option for advanced trainers is a 4-day upper lower split. But that is for people with especially good recovery abilities.\n \nIt amazes me how much the bodybuilding industry has confused the shit out of people. Telling them to workout 6 times per week, eat 2 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight, and other useless nonsense. Sure that works for the guys taking steroids, but all it does for a natural trainer is lead them nowhere. Yeah, you might experience results in a few months, but after that you’ll stagnate.\n \nFull-body workouts on the other hand, are the perfect routines for natural trainers. They offer enough volume, but not too much to where you can’t recover from. In addition, you’re joints and central nervous system get more of a break and time to recover because you’re not training as often.\n \nAll you need in a full-body workout is a major push, a major pull, and a major legs exercise. The intermediate and advance could also benefit from some assistance exercises for the arms and calves. But other than that, this is all you will ever need to grow. I currently am 6′1 and weigh 203 lbs, at 11 percent body fat. And I have been on a maintenance routine only lifting weights twice per week and sprinting on a third day. I haven’t gained any mass (hence the maintenance routine) but I still have continued to gain strength. One of my example workouts was this:\n \nWeighted Dips: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nWeighted Chin-ups: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nSquats: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nCalf raises and forearms: 2–3 sets of 10–15 reps\n \nWill you get to be 250 at 5 % body fat and become some absolute beast?? Hell no, not even close. But no natural trainer will ever get that close. If you are around 6 feet tall, the most you can ever expect to weight at 10 percent body fat is probably 215 to 220. And those numbers are for someone with very great genetics.\n \nI love how people think they need to follow the split routines 6 days per week because everyone else is doing it.\n \nWell, how many people do you see that are big and strong? Not many. How many people do you see at the gym following those splits who are actually big and NOT taking steroids? Probably zero.\n \nI talk about this in great detail in my book which you can find here: \nBasic But Brutal", "authorship": "human"}

When I was studying Swahili at a major university, the instructor had to repeatedly remind the students (based on homework I guess, and a couple priceless comments in class) that Africa is a continent and not a single country. This continued into the second year. (It probably didn’t help that they’d talk about things like vague “African culture” in class, but still.)\nAlso, not trying to be picky about word use, but just paying attention to nuances, I’d like to point out that \nignorant\n is a weird word. It just means\n not knowing\n. We’re all incredibly ignorant, of so many things. And while we’d like to learn more, being ignorant in that sense isn’t bad. The objection I have— and I think how most people usually use the word, especially to say \na person is ignorant,\n rather than being ignorant of something specific— is when someone appears to be intentionally ignorant, intentionally unaware of things in the world around them, uninterested in learning from others or questioning their assumptions. The most ignorant I’ve ever felt is when starting to study a new language, but it’s an exciting feeling of potential and curiosity, not time to shut off my brain.\n \nUpdate\n: as another ‘bonus’ I realized there’s something I forgot to mention before that I had intended to include.\n \nMe\n. Or actually all Americans. I’m a relatively educated and curious American who probably knows more than average. But as a habit, we Americans just don’t know some topics very well, such as geography and even our own politics and history. And I know those things fairly well, or at least I thought I did. Then I traveled to some other countries and I found out just how surprisingly much they know. First, of course they know a lot more about their country than I do, sometimes maybe more about their country than I know about mine, and typically world geography too. But more than that,\n they know so much about my country!\n I’m lucky if I can name the president of their country, but they know mine and a number of other government officials, and many past presidents. And they ask questions. Specific questions. I remember one time when I was with a friend in Ecuador, and he was reading a book about Abraham Lincoln. I was living in Illinois at the time when I took this trip, and he immediately connected that Abraham Lincoln was from Illinois. Suddenly he had dozens of questions, most of which I couldn’t answer. And I do know some things about Lincoln. This wasn’t an isolated incident either. So just keep that in mind. Makes you think twice about the idea of an American-knowledge citizenship test that most Americans couldn’t pass but many foreigners, who aren’t planning to take it, could. (Of course I’ve been asked silly questions about America too, if you’re wondering. But less often than you’d think. The best I’ve heard, indirectly, was someone who asked “Oh, California? Is that near Hollywood?”. That was in England, so maybe it reaffirms our shared origins.)", "authorship": "human"}

See a doctor.\nAnytime you want to start a new training or exercise program, it'll be a smart idea to see a doctor first. He will be able to tell you whether or not your plan is safe and appropriate for you.\n \nMake an appointment or call your doctor. Tell him about what your goals are and your exercise plan to help you reach them.\n \nAlso tell him whether or not you're having any joint or muscular pain in addition to having any pain or shortness of breath.\n \nAlso consider seeing a personal trainer. This is a fitness professional that will be able to help you set goals, design a plan to meet them and teach you how to do a variety of exercises safely.\n \n2. Set your goals.\nTraining your body is a fairly broad goal. To increase your chances of meeting your goal, you should work to make a more specific goal. Try using the S.M.A.R.T. goal system. Goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-Based have a higher chance of being an appropriate and reachable goal for you.\n \nIn addition, add in information about how you're going to reach your goal.\n \nSpend some time thinking about what you want to train. Do you want to just get in better overall shape? Are you training for a race? Do you want to build more strength or lean muscle? Do you want to lose some weight? How much? By when?\n \nAn example of a good goal would be: I want to run a 10 mile race in five months. I will run three to four days a week and increase my mileage by one mile every two weeks until I reach 10 miles.\n \n3. Start a journal to track your progress.\nRegardless of what you're training for or what you've set for yourself, tracking your progress in a journal may be a motivating part of your plan.\n \nWrite out your goals and your plan in your journal. This may help keep you focused and track.\n \nIn addition track your progress each day or week. If you're training for that 10 mile (16.1 km) race, maybe you write down how many miles you ran each week and how easy or hard it's been.\n \nYou can also keep a little calendar or chart of where you plan your exercise of the week or month.\n \n4. Join a gym or purchase fitness equipment.\nSome training plans may need a gym or specialized equipment to meet. Not all physical activity will need this, but you may want to consider what equipment you need to best meet your goal.\n \nConsider joining a gym. Many memberships are as low as $10 a month. Gyms offer you the ability to do most exercises inside. You can do a variety of cardio, strength training and even take classes. Even if you may not need the equipment at the gym, it might be nice to have the option to workout inside if it's a rainy or cold day.\n \nIf you're not a fan of the gym, maybe you could consider purchasing some at-home gym equipment. You can start small with just a few items like hand weights or resistance bands or buy more expensive equipment like cardio machines or home gym machines.\n \nPart 2 of 4:Training Your Body with Cardio Exercises\n1. Do 150 minutes of cardio weekly.\nThe Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend getting at least 150 minutes or about 2 1/2 hours of cardio activities each week for the minimum amount of health benefits. This breaks down to just five 30-minute sessions a week.\n \nStudies have shown that when people participate in 150 minutes of physical activity, they see a variety of health benefits including: decreased risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, weight loss, improved sleep and mood habits and even improved circulation.\n \nThe types of cardio activities that you can include for this 150 minutes can be anything from walking, running, biking, or doing a kickboxing class. However, the activity you do during the day (baseline or lifestyle activity) does not count towards your 150 minutes.\n \nIf you're just starting out with physical activity, one of your first goals may be to meet this general recommendation.\n \n2. Include both steady-state and interval training.\nThere are two main types of cardio exercises — steady-state and interval exercises. Both offer a variety of benefits, so try to incorporate both into your workout.\n \nSteady-state cardio are the activities that you do for at least 10 minutes and are maintaining your intensity. The goal is that you maintain a steady heart rate during your activity. For example, jogging for 20 minutes or using the elliptical at a steady speed for 30 minutes counts as steady-state cardio.\n \nSome of the specific benefits of steady-state cardio are: improved and faster recovery, maintenance of lean muscle mass, significant increases in cardiovascular and aerobic fitness levels, and immediate decreases in blood pressure and blood sugar.\n \nHIIT or high intensity interval training is another type of exercise that has become more popular lately. It's a shorter workout in total and combines both short bouts of very, very high intensity exercises with periods of more moderate exercises.\n \nThe benefits of HIIT differ slightly than steady-state cardio and can include: a more efficient and faster workout, increased ability to burn calories from fat and increased metabolism for eight to 24 hours after you've completed the workout.\n \nRegardless of which type of exercise you choose to do predominantly, it's better to do a combination of both HIIT and steady-state as you can reap the benefits of both.\n \n3. Increase your baseline activity.\nAlthough baseline doesn't come with as many benefits of steady-state or HIIT types of workouts, it's still an important part of being active.\n \nBaseline activity or lifestyle activities are things that you do on a typical day — walking to and from your car or doing household chores.\n \nThese activities do not burn many calories by themselves or increase your heart rate, but when you increase them as much as you can, over the entire day they do burn some calories and can help support your fitness levels.\n \nIncreasing your baseline makes your body function more efficiently in day-to-day activities (which burns more calories with less work).\n \nThink about ways that you can be more active or include more movement in your day. You could: park farther away, take the stairs instead of the elevator, take short walk breaks during your lunch break and stand or do light exercises during commercial breaks.\n \nPart 3 of 4:Training Your Body with Weight-Bearing Exercises\n1. Include two to three days of strength training weekly.\n \nIn addition to cardio, the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans also recommends that you include about two to three days of strength training or weight-bearing exercises each week.\n \nStrength and resistance training offers you different benefits compared to aerobic or cardio exercises, such as: it protects bones and helps prevent osteoporosis, maintains and can increase lean muscle mass, increase your overall metabolism, improves balance and coordination, and boosts energy levels.\n \nWeight training exercises can include a variety of activities including: plyometric exercises or body weight exercises, free weights, using weight machines, or doing yoga or pilates.\n \n2. Do a combination of compound and isolation exercises.\nWhen it comes to weight lifting or resistance training there are two basic types of exercises — compound and isolation exercises. Both offer different benefits and which one you choose will depend on your overall goal.\n \nCompound exercises are activities that recruit multiple joints and multiple muscle groups in order to perform. Examples of compound exercises include: barbell bench press, squats and lunges.\n \nThe benefits of compound exercises include: reduced risk of overtraining, less time spent overall exercising, increased gains in muscle mass, and increased gains in strength.\n \nIsolation exercises are those that only target one small group of muscles or use weight machines to target only one muscle group. Examples include using the bicep curl machine or seated tricep extensions.\n \nFor most training goals (even from basic to more advanced), spending more time with compound exercises is your best bet. Isolation exercises are best for fine tweaking once you have already met your goals.\n \n3. Choose to do a low or high set of reps.\n \nIn addition to choosing compound or isolation exercises, you'll also need to decide whether or not you want to do higher reps with a low weight or lower reps with a higher weight.\n \nHigher reps usually results in bigger gains in muscle mass, not strength. If you're goal is to build mass, include exercises that have higher reps.\n \nLower reps with much higher weights results in significant strength gains, not necessarily increased muscle mass.\n \nIt's best to do a combination of both high and low rep exercises. However, tailor this depending on what you're goal is (bigger muscles or increased strength).\n \nPart 4 of 4:Training Safely\n1. Warm up.\n \nBefore any type of workout, it's essential to warm up appropriately beforehand. Try to include even a short warm up before you exercise for the safest workout.\n \nWarm-up exercises don't have to be anything specific. It's generally recommended to do a warm-up routine for at least five to 10 minutes. However, the longer you plan on working out, the longer your warm-up routine should be.\n \nThe goal of warm-ups includes: slowly dilates your blood vessels in your muscle to help increase blood and oxygen flow, raises the temperature of your muscles for the best flexibility and efficiency, and it also slowly raises your heart rate which decreases the overall stress on your heart.\n \nWarm-ups are typically a slower version of whatever activity you plan on doing. For example, if you're planning on going for a run, walk for five to 10 minutes first.\n \n2. Take a rest day or two.\nAlthough it may seem counterintuitive, taking adequate rest days is just as important as the actual exercise. Without proper rest days, it'll be hard to meet any training goal.\n \nIn regards to strength training, rest days are actually when your muscles grow in size and strength.\n \nIf you do not take rest days, overtime, you will have poor performance and poor results.\n \nOn your rest days, try to still include light-intensity activity. You don't necessarily want to lounge around all day without doing anything. Ideally do some walking or restorative yoga.\n \n3. Stretch.\nA combination of adequate rest, warming up and stretching will put your body in the best condition for exercise and great results.\n \nStretching has been shown to help reduce muscle stiffness and pain when done appropriately. In addition, it can also help improve flexibility over time\n \nOther benefits of regular stretching include: better posture, increased blood flow, prevent back and neck pain, and improve balance.\n \nYou can do a slow stretching routine with moves like toe touches or you can take a restorative and stretching class like yoga.", "authorship": "human"}

This person would have to be my second cousin who just so happens to be American. Over the years she has provided me with ample material to supply a ready answer any time I’m asked about the most insanely inane and extraordinarily moronic things I’ve ever heard in life. I spent three weeks traveling around the Pacific Rim in 2006 and China was one of several counties I visited. While talking with this second cousin of mine shortly after the trip I was casually mentioning something about my time in Beijing that somehow (I don’t remember the exact detail) alluded to the fact I had breakfast at the hotel where I was staying, at which point she had to stop to interrupt me with her astonished (and astonishing) remark. Mind you, I’m not describing the reaction of a child, but the reaction of an adult. An adult who certainly never traveled beyond her own borders, but an adult homo sapien, all the same. She was so astonished to find out that people eat breakfast in China… As in— she was astonished, as in— she found it hard to believe that the concept of ‘breakfast,’ having a meal in the morning hours that is actually part of a routine and actually gets an official title for it as the equivalent of “breakfast.”\n \nLet’s stop for a moment to consider this mindset— and while meaning no cruelty or disdain for this mindset, I am okay having a little bit of fun with it.\n \nYou mean to inform me that breakfast exists in China? As in that super-far-away country with well over a billion people and one of the oldest civilizations in world history dating back to the Shang Dynasty around 1600 BC— they got breakfast over there, for real? No way!!! The same people who created the Great Wall and the Terra Cotta warriors, who gave us the I Ching, Taoism, acupuncture, not to mention all the tea— they were ingenious enough to conceive of having something like lunch or dinner in the morning time, like a whole meal to start the day? Like they really have breakfast, the real thing, not something just kind of similar? Are they just copying us? Is breakfast just another American implant over there like the Disneylands in Shanghai and Hong Kong? Or did these folks really come up with such a thing on their own? You mean to tell me the people who invented paper, silk, gunpowder, printing, the compass, the kite, the umbrella, and all that other stuff were actually sophisticated enough to think that having something like an ordinary meal in the morning made sense? How weird that people all over the world could seriously think of doing the same thing before noon that would involve food— and not just once as a fluke— but EVERY DAY. Wow. How do these things happen? Very interesting coincidence.\n \nI can only hope that maybe I was more astonished by her than she was by that. But I guess that wouldn’t be all too redeeming either…\n \nLike wow, you mean we don’t just do that over here??? People consume morning meals in other places around this strange world? Do they sleep and go to the bathroom too? What about the birds and the bees on that side of the world? Is it actually the stork for real over there who brings the babies or do those foreign people get to make them babies the same way as us folks over here?\n \nI could also mention that this same second cousin has said many other things to me that were spectacular in their own way and have left me stunned speechless in quite different scenarios yet similar outrageously vacuous terms. After divorcing her first husband and telling me about what happened, she explained to me that what really messed up their marriage of less than 2 years was her mother coming home to find my second cousin’s husband having sex with another woman. She made sure to clarify for me that with all the shock involved about this scandalous display of infidelity discovered in flagrante delicto was simply a bridge too far. You see the problem here for her wasn’t the fact that her husband was cheating on her. No, no. It was perfectly fine if he cheated on her anywhere else in the universe indoors outdoors upstairs downstairs in public or private with or without consent with a thousand different women from every country on earth so long as he didn’t do it somewhere her mother would see it, somewhere like her home. So the divorce sounded more like Mom’s friendly suggestion than her own idea. My cousin told me the guy she married was always cheating on her, but that alone wasn’t a sufficient reason to divorce him. Who would be so shallow to even think of such a thing? For such a minor offense, really. Sounds a bit like overreacting. Cheating couldn’t be anything more than like a misdemeanor in the marriage world, right? Now something like forgetting an anniversary might be a felony, but cheating? Divorcing someone over some kind of infidelity would be just like giving the death penalty to someone for j-walking.\n \nShe said while a lot of people had even gone so far as to suggest something like she should divorce the guy for being a habitual, unhindered, remorseless cheater, she didn’t see it this way from her enlightened perspective. I recall how she capped this off by saying, ever so glibly and almost in a huffy sort of way, without a whiff of reflection or even the faintest iota of critical thinking that could, you know, maybe randomly occur by accident: “Oh no, you don’t leave someone for cheating. You just work through it.”\n \nRight. It sounds like a small communication error after all, and can be fixed rather speedily. Maybe just start talking a little bit more between each of his short and maybe often extensive outings (vacations, cruises, Sunset Blvd, maybe a few Turkish style harems including sex sprees with his worldwide sprawl of liaisons).\n \nIn all seriousness, though, there does seem to be a somewhat intriguing rationale worth considering here. Nothing wrong with my cousin to be able to look at the bigger picture. Maybe if the person caused a genocide, divorce would be justifiable. Compared to that, infidelity seems a bit trivial. I mean, look at this way, as some mother might put it in her sage advice, or better yet, a Solomonic marriage counselor: “Yeah you’re married to a chronic cheater— but at least he isn’t Hitler or Stalin. He wants sex with more people in his life, but does that really make him such a bad guy? Look on the bright side, he’s not wanting to exterminate an entire ethnic group!”\n \nThis same second cousin also happened to make another noteworthy utterance the day of my grandfather/ her great-grandfather’s funeral. It was especially noteworthy because she said this to me that day and neither of us were actually at the funeral (which was out of state and I was unable to attend for various reasons) but actually just ran into each other by chance in the parking lot of the mall. I thought it was odd enough that the day of my grandfather’s funeral, when I felt sad about not being at the funeral where my parents and many extended family members were, I just happened to see a relative of mine from the same side of the family at the mall. Well, my second cousin had her own way of making this slightly, yet unforgettably odder. Naturally, seeing as how we just randomly ran into one another and it was the day of our grand/great grandfather’s funeral, that was immediately brought up… I think I just said something like, “Crazy about grandpa huh?”\n \nShe started off with, “Yeah, how do you feel about what’s happened with grandpa?”\n \nAt which point I said something, which I’m sure would be just about the same kind of answer as anyone would give about how they feel losing one of their grandparents… I could’ve messed with her and said, “Oh I feel great. Dead grandfather. It’s wonderful!” But no, I wasn’t in the humorous mood and said something sincere, like, “Oh yeah, really sad.”\n \nBut it was her response to this that really took me by surprise, when she said, “I hear he’s getting better.”\n \nI was too dumbfounded with disbelief to come up with any notable response. I think I just said matter-of-factly, “His funeral is today.”\n \nIn retrospect, a better (or funnier and more sardonic) response to say I gave would’ve been something like: “Really? You hear he’s getting better? Interesting. Cuz I was told he died and that the funeral is actually being held today and that my parents are actually up there attending it as we speak… Maybe I should call them and double-check. You never know, it’s possible someone lied about this.”", "authorship": "human"}

Intervertebral discs are the gel like “spacers” that are found between each of the bones of your spine (aka, vertebrae).\nWhen these discs fill with water, they actually push the bones of the spine (verterbrae) away from each other. This is why you stand slightly taller in the morning, than at night.\n \nSo, first thing in the morning when you get up, these discs are full of water. When you stand up the water starts to run out the discs, and thus you become just a wee-bit shorter.\nOk, but why should I care about water in my discs?\nThe increased water in the discs actually makes the spine stiffer. However, this isn’t a good kind of stiffness.\n \nThis stiffness places a lot of stress on the discs and ligaments vs. the actual soft tissue structures designed to support and protect said discs.\n \nIt takes about an hour of standing for the discs to mostly empty of the water they obtained during sleep.\nSo…can I still workout in the early morning?\nOf course.\n \nBut, if you’re planning to workout within an hour (ish) of getting up you need to be careful about jumping into the following exercises too quickly:\nHeavy back squats or deadlifts → heavily compresses the spine\nHeavy kettlebell swings → ballistic hip hinging\nSitups → flexing your spine through full range of motion\nExcessive bending and twisting movements in general\nBelow are a few good options to get your spine warmed up, before crushing an early morning workout:\nWake up earlier → gives your spine more time to get back to equilibrium before hitting the gym\nGo for a brisk walk or light jog, before hitting the weights → moving around helps reduce spine stiffness a little faster\nExtend your warmup → if you normally warmup for 5–8 minutes, extend that out to 12–15 minutes.\nBut you didn’t answer the question…Is a morning gym workout \nbetter\n for the health of your spine than an evening gym workout?\nDone correctly, both early morning workouts and evening workouts are fine for your spinal health.\n \nIf you’re working out in the morning, you’ll just need to pay more attention to your preparation before you start crushing heavy weights at the gym.\n \nTrust me, it’s worth paying a little more attention and not just jumping into 1RM deadlifts or squats in the morning, in order to keep your spine injury and pain-free.\n \nAgain, the reason why I’m saying this is that suffering a debilitating back injury really sidelines you, and will make your life absolutely miserable.\n \nTrust me, this happened to me about 12 years ago—back when I was foolishly squatting heavy at 6:30am before classes (and before knowing this information).\nFinal thoughts\nLike I mentioned earlier, this answer can be taken in many different directions. \n“Better”\n can mean a lot of different things; so I opted to go with what I think is the most important topic to talk about—the health of your spine.\n \nI don’t want this answer to scare you out of working out in the morning, though.\n \nThat’s not my intent.\n \nMy intent is to simply highlight things you need to be aware of, if you are in fact going to workout in the morning.\n \nI hope this answer helps give you a little better idea about keeping your spine healthy during early morning workouts.\nSources for this knowledge\nMost of the knowledge I have learned about spinal mechanics has come from the various work of Dr. Stuart McGill.\n \nDr. McGill is the world’s leading expert in spinal biomechanics. He’s definitely an individual you should listen to regarding spinal health. If you Google his name you’ll find dozens of articles that he’s published about the spine.

The most ignorant people in America are those holding staunch opinions without being able to articulate the other side’s argument realistically. If they can’t articulate the argument realistically and sincerely, it shows that person has never opened their mind enough to consider why others hold an opposing view - that is the hallmark of ignorance.\n \nCase in point. The majority of Trump supporters were labeled as “racist, mysogynist, homophobes”. Why else would they support Trump as a candidate?\n \nRacist - Many on the left would posit that Trump supporters want a wall, or tighter border security because “we hate Mexicans or other foriegners”. Not true.\n \n1. The majority of those on the right advocating tighter border security are considering the impact of more people requiring more services when we have finite resources to address these problems at current population levels already.\n \n2. Many on the Right have watched the impact of unrestricted migration into European countries and believe that careful screening of those seeking entry is simply prudent.\n \nCaution and prudence are not racist. Let’s face it, you would not let your daughter spend the night at a stranger’s home until you’ve at least had the chance to speak with the parent. Is that because you are hateful, or is that because you are prudent?\n \nMisogynism - Did Trump say horrible things about women? Certainly. Did Hillary defend a child rapist? Certainly. However, based on what we believe to be the best person to address economic issues, issues of national security, job growth, etc - the candidates on the Right were more closely aligned with our views on how to succeed. The vote was not an Anti-Woman referendum.\n \nHomophobists - Not seeing a issues like whom one can marry, or what is the appropriate titling of bathrooms, or who must bake a cake for whom, as being a top-priority national concern for America when we are facing stagnate job growth, continued terrorist threats, nuclear capable countries who maintain an Anti-US position does not make us homophobic. It simply says, be reasonable - at the end of the day how important is to a person in Vermont which bathroom I choose to use in Colorado? At the end of the day, how much time do I spend in public bathrooms anyway - so let’s use our time wisely to address bigger issues.\n \nIn summary - Ignorance is not taking time to see WHY others maintain positions they do. It is typically not out of hate or spite, but rather differing world views. At the end of the day most people on both sides of the aisle want similar things:\nAn ability to provide for ourselves and our families.\nRelative safety in our neighborhoods\nAccess to food and healthcare.\nWe simply disagree on the best avenues to enact the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

But it’s not nothing, either, and it’s reasonable to expect a noticeable improvement in strength within that timeframe assuming you know what you are doing.\n \nTo improve your strength, you need to stimulate the muscle fibers associated with strength (duh). These are known as “fast-twitch” muscle fibers. These fibers produce a lot of force quickly, as opposed to “slow-twitch” fibers which are more efficient, but produce less force. This means that in order to build strength, \nyou’ll want to lift heavier weights for shorter durations\n, rather than lighter weights for longer durations.\n \nNow, there are many different (often conflicting) schools of thought on how to optimally stimulate the body so as to build strength, so I don’t want to offer anything as the be-all, end-all of strength building, but \nhere’s a general structure that should at least get you started\n:\n \n-Compound exercises (exercises that involve more than one joint such as leg press, chest press, compound row, etc.) will be the most effective and efficient exercises. You can do isolation exercises as well (like bicep curls, etc.), but I would suggest you start your workouts with the compounds for optimal results.\n \n-For a given exercise, find a weight that will completely fatigue your muscles in about 1–2 minutes. Anything you cannot do for at least a minute is probably too heavy, and anything over two minutes is probably too light to stimulate the best results (as far as strength is concerned).\n \n-Try not to let your muscles relax for the entire duration of each exercise. So for example, if you’re using a leg press machine, don’t lock your legs out, and don’t rest the weights at the bottom. Keep moving and keep the muscles working the whole time. (This is important! Resting during an exercise allows your slow-twitch (endurance) muscle fibers a chance to recover, limiting engagement from fast-twitch (strength) fibers and therefore limiting your improvements in strength.)\n \n-Perform as many repetitions as you can, \nslowly\n*,\n until you can no longer \nsafely\n** \ncontinue (ie. muscle failure).\n \n*Emphasis on moving \nslowly\n because moving quickly means you are using momentum to carry the weight up/forward, and using gravity to assist on the way back. \nGo slowly and embrace the burn.\n \n**Emphasis on \nsafely\n because people tend to sacrifice form after getting carried away with thinking that the goal of exercising is to do as many repetitions as possible. It’s not. The goal of exercise is to stimulate a response in the body. \nKeep good form\n, challenge yourself, and when you can no longer move the weight with good form, stop and slowly set the weight down.\n \n-One \ngood\n set (ie., total muscle failure) per exercise \nshould\n be sufficient. This might be a controversial take, but this is how I exercise, and it saves me a lot of pain and time, and limiting myself to one set doesn’t seem to effect my results (as far as strength is concerned). Your results may vary, however, especially early on when you’re learning to push yourself, so if you want to do multiple sets, knock yourself out.\n \nTL;DR\n: Lift and lower the weights slowly, with good form, without resting, until your muscles become completely fatigued and you can no longer complete your final repetition, which ideally would occur between 1–2 minutes.\n \nI hope this helps; good luck!", "authorship": "human"}

You don't want to get hurt, so they can pretty much all be summed up into one commandment: Thou shalt not be an idiot.

There is zero reason to think that you need to do that unless you are 100% sure you can.

Things like “How long should I rest between sets?”, “How many reps should I do?”, “Are preacher curls better than standing curls?”, “Should I drink a protein shake during my workout or after? How long after?” … are all interesting questions but the truth is the answers have more to do with refinement than gross progress. Get in, lift weights, eat food and don't be an idiot and you will build muscle.\n \nThen there's cardio. Want to create a calorie deficit? Do cardio. Want to improve your heart’s performance? Do cardio. Should you do HIIT? Sure. Why not. Should you do long, slow duration? Sounds good. My rule for cardio is this: if you're just putting in the time then you won't get too much out of it. Come up with little challenges for yourself and then beat them. Maybe it's a certain calories/minute average. Maybe it's maintaining a certain speed for a certain time. Maybe it's keeping your heart rate above a certain number. Maybe it's that you want your shirt to be fully drenched when you're done. Whatever it is I promise that setting a goal and then beating it will ensure your cardio has an impact. Getting too detailed about it is great for refinement but once again the gross value is in making it happen.\n \nMost of us who train won't be Mr. Olympia, or win an Ironman triathlon. At the elite levels there are little refinements that need to be made, but those vary on an individual basis.

This was quite a while ago, I was taking a road trip from Michigan to California meandering throughout the country. I got lost somewhere in Texas, really not sure exactly where even, driving down what could best be described as a “dusty trail”, so far off the freeway, when I spied a store. I drove up to the store and got out to get something to drink and some snacks and directions back to the freeway. There were two older gentlemen sitting on the porch and one of them says, “Ain’t that there one of them Japs?”. The other one turned and looked at me and replies, “Yep, he is one of them Japs”. Then asks me what I’m doing there. I told him I was lost and needed directions and some snacks. And he asks, “Are you here peacefully, then?” I answered in the affirmative and he said, “Welcome to the best country in the world, son”, then got up and shook my hand. “Didn’t know they started allowing y’all back in the country.” Wow! The best part of it all, he took his hat off, placed it on his chest and apologized for his nation having killed so many of my people. Well, ignorant sure doesn’t mean “bad person”.", "authorship": "human"}

Others do really well on high volume!\n \nIn general, I tend to recommend more volume for those that want to improve size, as the research shows that gains tend to scale quite linearly with volume. However, it might not be that clear, for a few reasons.\n \nHigh volume training\n tends to increase \nsarcoplasm \nin the muscle. This is like your fuel tank-it includes glycogen storage as well as mitochondria for energy production needed during high volume training.\nSo, if you train with high volumes, your body can adapt by making your fuel tank bigger. Makes sense, right? This looks like muscle…because it basically \nIS \nmuscle. It’s \nin \nthe muscle and it looks like muscle from the outside. It’s muscle…just a different type.\n \nBut…it won’t really make you \nstronger\n. In fact, pound for pound, it’ll actually make you \nWEAKER\n, as it doesn’t help your strength, but does add weight!\n \nIt’s not contractile tissue!\nMuscle is mostly water…and then protein…but there is glycogen and fat there, too. That’s sarcoplasm. Fuel tank.\n \nSo, a lot of these studies are switching people from low (or no) volume programs to high volume programs, and finding that their muscles get bigger. A big part of what they are often seeing is the fuel tank getting bigger in response…\nnot \nthe actual muscle fibers!\n \nI’d wager that after a few weeks of going back to lower volume training (or nothing)…a lot of those gains are going to be lost, because they body doesn’t really need as big of a fuel tank anymore. It’s temporary. It’s transient. If I do high volume and then go on vacation, in a week or two, that extra weight is GONE. It’s often up to 4–5kg, and it’s not preventable with eating more. It’s a response to training.\n \nIt’s a longer-duration pump.\nArnold\n \nloved \nthe pump…he often trained forty, fifty, sixty sets per workout before competitions. And he responded marvelously to it.\n \nHe bench pressed north of 500lbs when he was a young man, but during his Mr. Olympia prep, most sets seemed to be with 2–3 plates per side-just 225–315lbs, about 50–60% of 1 rep max!\n \nFor set, after set, after set.\nSerge Nubret\n did as well-he did mostly sets of 15–20 reps far away from failure his entire career. Sometimes his workouts lasted \nFIVE HOURS\n, and he did them 6 times per week.\n \nPlus, he was French, so it was literally a full time job!\n \nWill this work for you?\n \nMaybe. But probably not.\n \nWithout anabolics, this type of training isn’t nearly as effective for size.\n \nMost strong advocates for \nhigh volume training \nare on drugs.\n \nDoing endless sets will just leave you tired, battered and injured.\n \nHowever…the thing is, most strong advocates for \nlow volume training\n are also on drugs.\n \nThe Dorian and Menzer method of one all out set to failure works for naturals…but best with pharmaceutical enhancement.\nThey are ALWAYS growing, so they can get away with this type of training.\n \nFor naturals, both high volume and low volume are death sentences for gains.\n \nWhy?\n \nHigh volume\n will cause an increase in cortisol, which is very catabolic and can cause muscle breakdown. It can also cause a decrease in testosterone, and if you are natural you don’t have the luxury of ignoring that. High volume will pump you up, but after a few weeks you’ll plateau hard. Your sarcoplasm can only get so big.\n \nLow volume\n isn’t enough stimulation for a natural to grow optimally in \nmost \ncases. Especially if you cannot push a set close to or to TRUE failure, then low volume training will be crap for gains. Guess what? Most people cannot-or at least, do not.\n \nI think in five years, I’ve seen maybe five people go to true failure in the gym…let alone go beyond failure.

He particularly believed so about Muslims and those from South of this country. I listened as he said that he was sure most Puerto Ricans were here illegally. I explained that Puerto Rico was a US commonwealth. He stated that commonwealths were just a “system for poor and lazy” people to take advantage of the real citizens and hard workers. Now, that seemed a bit odd coming from someone living in Chicago, but from the UK. I let it go.\nThis went on a bit. Then, after way too many drinks in celebration of one he'll of a show, he let it slip that his visa had expired 9 years ago. However, since he was white the US would never deport him. This is a man here illegally, earning about $175,000/year. His goal he stated, was to marry his girlfriend and then he was sure to never be deported. He kept his bashing of what he called “illegals” for months.\nI finally stopped hiring him. I also called the INS 5 times. I was told by the INS official that there are over 300,000 English, Irish, and French here illegally, all earning a median income of $64,000. He also said that going after these people was a sure way to stop any promotions in your future.\nSo, really, the dumbest or most hypocritical person was an American in name only.

They just had more \npractice\n.\nSorry…I just love that video.\n \nFull body routine disadvantages\nThey’re \nhard\n. This is BY FAR the main reason people gravitate towards bro splits. Mentally, going into the gym and working your entire body just is on another plane of existence in terms of difficulty compared to just working one chunk of muscle, even if the volume is the same. It’s easy to tap out when you have to do front squats, RDLs, bench press, overhead press, seated rows, pulldowns, lateral raises, curls, extensions and ab wheel all in the same day.\nPerhaps because of this, they can be tough on your \nhormone levels\n. Check the above chart; the full body testosterone went up 11%, but the split went up 21%! Keep in mind this was just four weeks, working out just three times per week, as well. Keeping up a full body protocol all the time, for higher volumes could \nprobably \nlead to reductions in T for some people.\nThey give you \nless time \nto \nrecover\n. This is part of the reason that I really am sure to use a lot of variety in my training when incorporating higher frequency. If you use the same movements all the time, be prepared for your joints to be unhappy. You need to vary the movement patterns enough that it shifts the stress on the joints at least slightly.\nSplit routine advantages\nMore \nrecovery time \nfor each body part between workouts.\nMight have better satellite cell activation (check the answer below) due to the \nincreased concentrated workload \nand greater \nmuscle damage\n. \nGeoffrey Verity Schofield's answer to How fast does lost muscle grow back with muscle memory?\nGet a \nbetter pump\n-doing more work in one session can lead to greater metabolic stress for that muscle.\nCan help you develop a better \nmind-muscle connection. \nYes, that’s a real thing, especially for the upper body.\nCauses increased \nsoreness\n, which can facilitate growth and let you “feel” that muscle better. This could be a disadvantage if you don’t like this feeling…I personally kinda like it for some twisted reason.\nSplit routine disadvantages\nLower frequency \nper muscle group. This is probably the biggest reason why split routines suck. You do chest on Monday (obviously), and your chest is really only growing for about 36–48hours afterwards. There are 168 hours of the week-why would you only have each muscle group growing 20–30% of the time? \nNot optimal! \nFull body routines can get that number up to 70–80+% for the entire body, which explains the massive difference in both muscle gain and fat loss.\nYou \ncan \nactually \nLOSE muscle\n. In the above example, you’re growing on Monday, Tuesday and maybe Wednesday. You might be maintaining on Thursday and Friday. But especially if you are cutting or not getting in enough protein, or not sleeping well, it’s entirely possible for the weekend to be in a catabolic state.\nNot that kind of Weaknd; he’s in a catabolic state 24/7\nYou can \nlose “touch” \nwith an exercise. This isn’t gonna happen with bicep curls or lateral raises, but with something like squatting or Olympic lifting, it’s entirely possible for the nervous system to slightly forget how to do these movements if you’re only doing them once per week.\nAll in all, I’d do full body \nmost \nof the time, but if you hit a plateau, splitting up your routine can be a nice change of pace.\n \nYou’ll have more time to recover, and can really focus on blasting a body part to force it to grow, perhaps through the aforementioned satellite cells. You can recover any hormonal or structural stress incurred during your full body bonanza.\n \nI’ve taken a page out of Eric Helm’s book\nand been doing full body workouts 4–6 times a week recently, and it’s been astonishingly effective.

By the time I’m done with this, I’m in ignition mode - ready to dominate the workout ahead.\nStrength is the foundation. Without it, everything else falls apart. I hit the gym four days a week, focusing on compound movements that target multiple muscle groups. Here’s how I break it down:\nDay 1: Push Day (Chest, Shoulders, Triceps)\nBench presses, overhead presses, dips, and push-ups. I mix up the rep ranges - some days it’s heavy with lower reps, other days it’s lighter with higher reps. This keeps the muscles guessing and growing.\nDay 2: Pull Day (Back, Biceps)\nDeadlifts, pull-ups, rows, and bicep curls. The deadlift is my bread and butter here. It’s a full-body movement that’s as functional as it gets, teaching the body how to move a heavy load safely.\nDay 3: Leg Day (Quads, Hamstrings, Glutes)\nSquats, lunges, leg presses, and Romanian deadlifts. Leg day is sacred. I go hard here because strong legs are the foundation of a strong body. I finish with calf raises because, hey, balance is everything.\nDay 4: Functional Day (Core, Mobility, Full Body)\nKettlebell swings, Turkish get-ups, farmer’s walks, and core work. This is the day where I mix it up. The goal is to build functional strength - strength that translates to real-life activities. I focus on stability, coordination, and mobility, making sure my body is not just strong but also agile.\nI’m not about that endless treadmill grind, but cardio has its place. After my strength work, I like to finish with high-intensity interval training (HIIT). It could be sprints, battle ropes, or a quick circuit of burpees, box jumps, and mountain climbers.\n \nThe idea is to get the heart rate up, torch some calories, and build endurance. This usually lasts 15-20 minutes, but it’s enough to leave me drenched in sweat and feeling like a warrior.\n \nEvery session ends with a solid 10-15 minutes of stretching and mobility work. I focus on the areas I hit that day, making sure everything stays loose and limber. This is crucial for recovery, injury prevention, and keeping the body moving smoothly. I throw in some yoga-inspired moves because flexibility is just as important as strength.\n \nRest days are just as important as workout days. I take two full days off each week to let my body recover. This is when the magic happens - muscles repair, grow, and get stronger.\n \nI stay active with light activities like walking or swimming, but nothing too intense. I also make sure to get plenty of sleep and fuel my body with the nutrition - testosterone booster, healthy fats, and carbs to keep my energy levels high.\n \nMy gym routine is a living thing. It evolves as I do. If something isn’t working or if I hit a plateau, I switch it up. I’m always learning, always pushing the boundaries of what my body can do. The gym isn’t just a place to work out; it’s a place to challenge myself, to grow, and to become the best version of me.\n \nSo, that’s my routine - a mix of strength, functionality, and a mindset that’s always hungry for more. It’s not just about building muscle; it’s about building a body that’s ready for anything. And trust me, when you approach the gym with this mindset, the results go way beyond the mirror.", "authorship": "human"}

They looked up at the number “1” - and again did nothing.

There was dead silence for several floors while each of us undoubtedly tried to make sense of what they had just said. Finally, the CNN anchor said, “One of them I could maybe understand but NEITHER ONE of them knows how an elevator works? I wonder how often they lock themselves in their car.”", "authorship": "human"}

He carried on asking me how is it I’m from England and hold a British passport so I had to explain to him British history from the 60’s onwards.

And I don't want to hurt your feelings. I respect that \nyou\n believe what you believe. I just don't see eye-to-eye with you.\n \nAs for the rest of you who are still here, I'll get to describing the venue:\n \nThe Reverend had rented a large community center/gymnasium out in a rural area, beyond the subdivisions and where the busses stopped running after dark.\n \nIt was in Chico, California. At that time, Playboy magazine had named it college party city #1 in the USA, so I was a bit worried about how I was going to find my way back into town, in the dark, when I was at\n “ground zero”\n with all the \nfreaks\n in town.\n \nI entered the building. I was early, with plenty of time to kill, as I'd taken the last bus out on the route, and it was still two hours 'til “show time.”\n \nI was met at a reception table\n,\n and asked to fill out an information card.\n \nIt asked my name, address, ailments, worries, how many children I had, financial status, and basically all the information any reasonably “psychic” faith healer would need to know about a person in order to pull off a convincing show.\n \nA-HA! Gotcha!\n \nI got my seat assignment and sat down.\n \nFront row. Next to a nice old couple. She, in a wheelchair. We had a couple hours to shoot the breeze as the room filled up.\n \nNice folks.\n \nAt one point she needed to use the facilities and asked that I wheel her to the Ladies Room.\n \nI obliged.\n \nRelieved, I watched her get up and \nwalk\n out of her chair\n,\n and enter the stall. At one point I worried I might have to go in there with her and help her out, but she was fine on her own.\n \nShe could walk.\n \nThe show started right on time.\n \nThe Reverend Saul David was introduced, as the band geared up and played some \nwonderful\n gospel tunes and he danced around, waving his arms, bobbing his blonde head, smiling (even as his eyebrows were scowling in a creepy way) and everybody clapped their hands and praised Jesus. That was the fun part!\n \nThe music was \ndelicious\n. Rich. Inspiring. I'm still a fan of gospel and learned a lot of technique that night. You wouldn't know if you heard me play piano, that I wasn't raised a Southern Baptist. I took to the style like a duck to water. It exudes essence, and soul, and truly touches me. I love the music!\n \nBut then the music \nstopped\n.\n \nThe fun ended. I suddenly found myself being held hostage for \nhours\n. A lot of \nboring\n talking.\n Preaching. Fire and Brimstone.\n \nBlah blah blah. \nMy eyes glazed over. I wanted to leave, but like I said, I was in the middle of nowhere, way out of town. It was dark, and I really didn't know exactly where I was.\n \nThe freakiest part of the evening came when the good 'ol Rev started picking people out of the audience.\n \n“There is someone here,” he began, “someone who recently lost a son. And God wants you to know, \nSully\n, that \nTony\n is beside him in Heaven and is just fine.”\n \nAnd Sully would whoop and weep. Relieved that his kid was okay in the Afterlife.\n \n“Someone here has been suffering from arthritis. \nLily\n has owned a bakery for years and can no longer knead her bread!”\n \nAt which point, my seat neighbor, the one I'd taken to the Lady's room, let out a startled gasp, and put her hand over her lips in astonishment! She was eating that stuff up.\n \nThe Reverend made his way over to our row and grabbed onto the old woman's head and started speaking gibberish, \n“Loobagoda Brigga Nighga Shwopa-fumanigha poo Veggie lool roog bon FWEEEEEE!”\n \n(My eyes went wide. I was suddenly frightened.)\n \n“IN THE NAME OF JEEEZUS-AH, YOU WILL BE HEEEEELED, NOWA! Stand up and WALK!” \nHe \nscreamed\n directly into her face, and I watched, bird's eye view, as \nspittle\n flew from his mouth, into her open eyes and drenched her face.\n \nShe was weeping as she stood, wobbly at first, then raising her arms started walking up and down the aisles!\n \nThe congregation erupted. Talking in tongues, arms raised, standing, stomping\n,\n as the organ chimed in and accompanied such an amazing “\nmiracle” \ntaking place!\n \nThe Reverend took her wheelchair\n,\n and kicked it, \nactually kicked it, \naway (I was hoping the old lady got it back later.)\n \nOh, the tears did flow!\n \nAt the end of the evening, the Reverend, tired of making fake predictions by getting information fed to him in his secreted earpiece from the cards we'd filled out before the “show” started, had us all line up and went down the queue, “healing” us one-by-one.\n \nHe was grabbing heads and \nliterally\n pushing people backwards into the arms of his assistants. When he got to me I didn't fall over, I \nresisted, held my ground\n and I laughed in his face.\n \nHe looked pissed off.\n \nLuckily, he didn't point out I was possessed by the devil or anything, or I might have been torn to shreds by the fanatics in that room!\n \nFinally, after four hours of exhausting bullshit, it was over.\n \nPeople were gladly handing over a good portion of their paychecks at the reception table as they filed out of the room.\n \nLeaving the show, I ended up collecting my jacket from my seat. I met the old couple there, and said farewell.\n \nI watched them as they slowly began to walk away, the husband escorting his fragile wife as she painfully took each step and leaned heavily on his arm.\n \n“Don't you want your wheelchair?” I asked, as I pointed to it, still sitting in the corner, where the Reverend had kicked it earlier during his sermon.\n \nShe looked me straight in the eye and said:\n \n“Oh no! I've been \nhealed by our Lord, Jesus Christ!\n I will never sit in \nthat\n thing again!”\n \n..And off toddled the most ignorant American I've ever met.", "authorship": "human"}

The best option is the circuits in which four or five different types of activities alternate with rest periods between series and series . Coaches say that without killing themselves and choosing the activity table, the body will notice in 66 days.\nPlan the session; Exhausting is not a guarantee of good results\n \nWhat is better, to train strength or resistance? We are facing the eternal question when it comes to exercising. We arise because we have little time in day to day and we want, logically, to get the most out of our activity. But choosing between both is a wrong view, since it leads us in most cases to the mistake of hitting an aerobic bludgeon, thinking that with it we will burn more fats , or routines with a lot of weight in order to gain more muscle.\n \nThe reality is that people who manage to train continuously do so on average twice a week and no more than forty minutes each time . With this average, if we want to generate significant changes in our body to improve health and aesthetics, we have to change our perspective. By focusing one day on muscle mass and another on aerobic exercises, the stimulus to which the body is subjected is insignificant, even if we end up exhausted.\nThe reason is that the organism does not know if it runs in front of a lion to survive - and is making an extra effort for it - or if it trains for a healthy goal. So, if you are sitting for eight hours or so many hours standing up and suddenly an intense and unordered physical activity is imposed, your tendency will be to protect yourself. It will neither burn more fat, nor generate more muscle; on the contrary, it will try to reserve itself and spend as little as possible, in case the effort is prolonged in time. Your reaction is biologically logical.\n \nSo, what is the ideal dynamic? The answer is very simple: combine the two modalities in the same session or at different times but within the same day. The professionals call it concurrent training. However, after answering the first question, at least two more questions arise. The first: how much time is necessary to use to notice significant changes in the body? And the second: how to combine strength and resistance exercises in each session?\n \nThe magic figure: nine and a half weeks\n \nThe University College of London sets at 66 the days necessary to generate or change a habit or to achieve the goal that we set. You rarely get to the ten weeks of training followed. Most of us move by peaks of intensity. There are two periods that are key: the beginning of the year, when many people join a gym or start running; and towards the month of May, coinciding with the fact that the first hot days make us see summer around the corner.\nMany coaches propose that we divide our goals into blocks of 66 days. This will not only help us see results, but also motivate us with a goal that has a beginning and an end. Once you have made the decision, you have to plan the exercise with realism. How much time do I train? The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every week spread over five days - a half hour a day - or three sessions of between twenty minutes and one hour of vigorous activity .\n \nThis is ideal, however, the perfect dose is one that is compatible with the activities of daily and working life in the medium and long term. To achieve the goal, you have to be practical.

Then you just have to do the push, which will be hard, but give it 100% and then stop and reset as needed.\n \nNext, bodyweight squats. Sit on a kitchen chair, or the toilet, or a comfortable chair if you really want to. Without using your arms, lean forward and stand up. Once you are fully upright, sit back down again but do not let your weight sink into the chair - just sit down until you feel contact between your body and the material of the seat.

All these\"workouts\" may work great things for your health. They will keep your weight in check, improve your balance and range of motion, strengthen your muscles, protect your muscles, stop bladder control issues, and also ward off memory loss.\n \nIndependent of your age or fitness level, these actions are a Few of the very best exercises that you can do and can Help You to Get in shape and Decrease Your risk for disorder:\n \n1. Swimming\nYou may call swimming the ideal workout.\n \nStudies have discovered that swimming may also enhance your mental condition and set you in a much better mood. Water Resistant is another choice.\n \n2. Tai chi\nA combination of movement and comfort is perfect for the mind and body. In reality, Tai chi is a Chinese martial art that has been known as\"meditation in movement.\" Since the courses are offered at different degrees, tai chi is available - and beneficial - for everybody and every age and fitness levels. \"It is especially great for elderly people because equilibrium is a significant part of fitness, and equilibrium is something we lose as we age,\" Dr. Lee says.\n \nHave a course that will assist you to get started and find out the appropriate form. It is possible to locate tai chi apps at the regional YMCA, gym, community center, or senior center.\n \n3. Strength training\nLifting light weights will not bulk up your muscles, but it is going to keep them strong. \"If you do not use muscles, then they will lose their power over time,\" Dr. Lee says.\n \nComparable to additional exercise, strength training might also help maintain brain function in later decades.\n \nBefore beginning a weight training program, make sure you learn the appropriate form. Start mild, with only a couple of lbs. You ought to be able to lift the weights 10 days easily. After a few weeks, raise this by a pound or 2. If you're able to easily lift the weights through the whole selection of movement over 12 days, then move up to marginally heavier weight.\n \n4. Walking\nWalking is easy yet secure. Additionally, it can help you keep lean, enhance cholesterol levels, fortify bones, and keep blood pressure in check, raise your mood, and decrease your risk for any range of diseases (diabetes and cardiovascular disease, by way of instance ). A variety of studies have revealed that walking and other physical actions can even enhance memory and withstand age-related memory reduction.\n \nAll you will need is a well-fitting and inviting pair of sneakers. Begin with walking for approximately 10 to15 minutes at one time. As time passes, you may begin to walk further and faster, until you are walking for 30 to 60 minutes most days of this week.\n \n5. Kegel exercises\nThese exercises will not allow you to look better. However, they do something equally as significant -- strengthen the pelvic floor muscles which support the bladder. Strong pelvic floor muscles may go a long way toward preventing puberty. When many women are acquainted with Kegels, these exercises may benefit guys also.\n \nSqueeze the muscles you would like to stop yourself from passing gas or urine is the best way to do a Kegel exercise properly. Hold the contraction for a couple of seconds, then release. Be sure that you completely relax your pelvic floor muscles following the decrease. Attempt to perform four to five places every day.\n \nRaking the lawn counts as physical activity. So does ballroom dance and playing with your children or grandkids. Provided that you are doing some aerobic exercise for at least 30 minutes each day, and you also comprise two weeks of strength training each week, you may consider yourself a \"busy\" individual.", "authorship": "human"}

Pigeons lay eggs?!” The teacher said “yes, of course. All birds lay eggs.” And she said “Really? Like ducks?” “yes, like ducks. You can buy duck eggs in the shops.”\n \nThis girl, like me, was white, British, middle-class. My parents knew her parents, they were nice and had just as much money. She went to the same primary school (even the same pre-school) as me, so we’ve have the same formal education since we were 4 years old. She has had every opportunity to learn but she went her whole life knowing that chickens lay eggs and she was never, ever bothered to ask about the reproductive arrangements of other birds, or absorb that information when it was given to her (as in must have been at some point, she was 17). Last I heard she went to university, but I don’t know what she studied.\n \nWhen I was a child I had a brain like a sponge, I wish I could learn as easily as I did then. I was also very curious about everything and always asked “why?” I’ve heard this said about children in general, that children are naturally inquisitive and love to learn, and most people I meet agree that this is the case, my own children certainly are. But it seems that some children really don’t care what lays eggs, what language they speak in France, why is the sky blue, what does “coincidence” mean, what are your kidneys for, why is your blood red, what are the Egyptians (these are the sorts of things my son asks me, and other parents say the same sort of things). Sadly it seems that some children simply don’t care, so long as they know the names of the members of the latest pop-band they will be accepted by their peers, and they don’t care about anything else in the world. Some people, it seems, never question anything, even as children, and its not just an American phenomenon.", "authorship": "human"}

I told him to look up the details about the mass shooting in “Dunblane, Scotland” in 1996 and see how the subsequent gun control brought in has meant there has been no repeat of that tragedy. His response a while later said that he could find no evidence of the Scottish government bringing in any anti-gun laws and therefore I was lying.\n \nI pointed out that it was the UK government that had reacted to the tragedy and brought in laws to cover the whole UK.\n \nHe then accused me of “moving the goalposts”. I had specfically mentioned “Dunblane, Scotland” (which was true, I had) but now I was talking about “UK laws” which was a completely different matter and not relevant to Scotland.\n \nI remained calm, explained that Scotland was in the UK and apologised if I had caused confusion. Yes, I apologised, I’m quite happy to apologise even if I’ve done nothing wrong if it helps keep the peace and means everyone stays calm. But it didn’t work.\n \nHe replied with a meme of some soccer players carrying some goalposts with a caption about movng the goalposts when your first argument doesn’t work. He kept insisting that UK laws on gun control were not relevant and that I was changing my argument after the first one didn’t work. And then the usual MAGA insults started flying - he was still assuming I was American so “libtard” started getting a mention along with the usual baseless lies about “Biden’s laptop” and “socialists want to take away all our guns”.\n \nI blocked him and deleted all his replies. :-)", "authorship": "human"}

Nope; instead he said: “Well, I have heard that Russians are behind times, you know.” I explained to him that screws are 4000 years old invention and Russians or actually Soviets are not behind in any technology at all because the moment you guys invent something they pay someone who is willing to sell it.\n \nIn 1992 I was in a supermarket with a girlfriend whose disposition was: “I like to buy my own brands”, so I was more an observer as a clever man should do. As I was just standing at the beginning of an aisle, a man looking to be about 60 approached me and blurred: “Hey, what’s your name?” I just said my name and he just grabbed my hand, shook it and said: “Welcome to America! Now you can go to school, learn to read and write, make something of yourself. Isn’t it great to be in a great country? We have electricity and stores and everything!” By this time, my GF had heard the last part and came for an attack. To stop her from getting upset and ruining the night, I just used sign language to tell her to play along: she knew sign language because she was an interpreter. I thanked the guy and mentioned that I hope I can get accepted in a good school. He looked at me and said: “Oh, are you deaf?” I just said: “No, she is! Have a nice night.”\n \nIn 1996 I had a business meeting with a potential client whom could only meet for breakfast. He named a restaurant in a hotel, which was his favorite, and I accepted. Arriving on time, he was already there so I sat down and magically a waiter appeared with our drinks! He told me that he had already placed the orders for our drinks! I started to dread the moment as we were in south and I abhor iced tea or sweet tea as they call it. I was wrong; the waiter placed a short glass (whiskey glass) in front of me and said: “Your vodka, sir.” I looked at my host, a bit puzzled, and he just smiled and said: “You Russians drink vodka, right? I got you some Smirnoff Russian vodka!”. I generally think one should treat others as one expected to be treated, alas, I doubt this was a situation for such care. I decided that the client aspect is not as important to me as being treated like a child and upper handed behavior. I replied: “I am not going to count on us having any business after I say this: I am not Russian, and Russians don’t drink vodka for breakfast in general, you should know that Smirnoff is not made in Russia, but in USA, and I don’t think it is polite to order someone’s drink before you even know them.” He just got up and said: “Well #$^& you too, I was trying to be nice to you, I am not giving you any business!”\n \nTake your pick.\n \nNOTICE: Before any American Quora viewer starts to post ANY messages to tell me how this and that and American hating etc., read the following: There are ignorant in EVERY COUNTRY; god made man in his own image.

And every twenty seconds, I'd increase the speed by .20\n \nBefore all this, I was always confused as to why people enjoyed running track or doing seemingly linear sports ike cross-country.

I guess, it has more to do with some Americano-centrism in the education system rather than individual ignorance.\n \nMany years ago, my family hosted an American couple for a few days in Brussels. We had some common friends in California, a Belgian painter and her partner working for the Department of Justice. Both of our guests held senior positions. She was an HR manager for a high-tech company and he was a Senior Attorney. Although they had little command of any foreign language, they were both well-read, and we enjoyed every moment we shared. At one point, however, my father enquired about their projects in Europe.\n \nThe husband explained that, of course, they were willing to visit the “Beaches” in Normandy, some American war-cemeteries in the region and the war memorial in Caen as well. My father advised them to continue their tour back to Belgium and visit Bastogne, where they’d have the opportunity to visit a museum dedicated to the “Battle of the Bulge”. (as the battle for Bastogne is usually known in the US). He even insisted given that distances are way shorter in Europe they could spend the day over there and come back for dinner in Brussels, stay overnight, and catch their plane the day after!\n \nAt that point, they were both intrigued. The lady asked about how the actual “short distance was”, and her husband wondered how far Germany was exactly. My father blushed a bit and tried to explain that Bastogne was a Belgian town that American soldiers held against overwhelming Nazi forces until Monty turned up, and the skies cleared in 1944. All that sounded like well-learned school lessons, but he was stunned when he heard the American gentleman remark: Do you really mean that Belgium was occupied by Germany during the Second World War?!\n \nMy father remained voiceless. And I whispered, “For about four years, that’s right”… It seemed that a new world had opened up before their eyes. They suddenly became so keen to understand and explore, they looked like children discovering their x-mas presents, and we had a great time together. Yet, years after, we still didn’t understand that American schools could not inform American children that the Battle of the Bulge took place in a war-shattered country called Belgium!", "authorship": "human"}

The best option is the circuits in which four or five different types of activities alternate with rest periods between series and series . Coaches say that without killing themselves and choosing the activity table, the body will notice in 66 days.\nPlan the session; Exhausting is not a guarantee of good results\n \nWhat is better, to train strength or resistance? We are facing the eternal question when it comes to exercising. We arise because we have little time in day to day and we want, logically, to get the most out of our activity. But choosing between both is a wrong view, since it leads us in most cases to the mistake of hitting an aerobic bludgeon, thinking that with it we will burn more fats , or routines with a lot of weight in order to gain more muscle.\n \nThe reality is that people who manage to train continuously do so on average twice a week and no more than forty minutes each time . With this average, if we want to generate significant changes in our body to improve health and aesthetics, we have to change our perspective. By focusing one day on muscle mass and another on aerobic exercises, the stimulus to which the body is subjected is insignificant, even if we end up exhausted.\nThe reason is that the organism does not know if it runs in front of a lion to survive - and is making an extra effort for it - or if it trains for a healthy goal. So, if you are sitting for eight hours or so many hours standing up and suddenly an intense and unordered physical activity is imposed, your tendency will be to protect yourself. It will neither burn more fat, nor generate more muscle; on the contrary, it will try to reserve itself and spend as little as possible, in case the effort is prolonged in time. Your reaction is biologically logical.\n \nSo, what is the ideal dynamic? The answer is very simple: combine the two modalities in the same session or at different times but within the same day. The professionals call it concurrent training. However, after answering the first question, at least two more questions arise. The first: how much time is necessary to use to notice significant changes in the body? And the second: how to combine strength and resistance exercises in each session?\n \nThe magic figure: nine and a half weeks\n \nThe University College of London sets at 66 the days necessary to generate or change a habit or to achieve the goal that we set. You rarely get to the ten weeks of training followed. Most of us move by peaks of intensity. There are two periods that are key: the beginning of the year, when many people join a gym or start running; and towards the month of May, coinciding with the fact that the first hot days make us see summer around the corner.\nMany coaches propose that we divide our goals into blocks of 66 days. This will not only help us see results, but also motivate us with a goal that has a beginning and an end. Once you have made the decision, you have to plan the exercise with realism. How much time do I train? The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every week spread over five days - a half hour a day - or three sessions of between twenty minutes and one hour of vigorous activity .\n \nThis is ideal, however, the perfect dose is one that is compatible with the activities of daily and working life in the medium and long term. To achieve the goal, you have to be practical. Therefore, every session we take, even if it is ten minutes, should be used to the maximum and have all the necessary components so that our health improves little by little.\nA circuit with which we could start today would be this:\n \n1) 200 meters running or walking ;\n \n2) Ten squats;\n \n3) Eight push-ups.\n \n4) Six vertical jumps and return to run or walk 200 meters.\n \nWe should do it twice, with thirty seconds of rest between each exercise and two minutes of rest between circuit and circuit. The training lasts between twenty-five and thirty minutes.", "authorship": "human"}

My generation is supposedly the first in which people were unlikely to reach the level of prosperity their parents had achieved, and my students were even more unlucky - I taught in 2007 and the economy crashed that year, leaving most of my college seniors with no prospects of landing a job in their profession so that they could make payments on their student loans, which would start coming due just after graduation. Most left the state and moved around seeking any job they could find, leaving our state impoverished for young people to keep things going.\n \nThis is the effect of many decades of “trickle down economics”. The name and theory sound good, but in essence it requires pumping all the wealth up the to wealthiest people in the world, who do their best to hoard everything they get, with reasonable success. A bit does trickle back down to the middle classes and even less to the poor, but nothing compared to what the economic and tax policies have taken from us. And the latest tax restructuring policy is “trickle down” on steroids; it will be about 15 times worse for the economy than the current tax policy. I’m glad I never had kids, I will not have to watch them struggle worse than I had to in this wreck of a nation we are leaving to the next generations.

Before this one kid got there, nobody ever said “the n-word” mainly because there was absolutely no occasion for it. Anyway, we’re in Social Studies class, and this kid was apparently idly perusing the world map in the textbook, maybe the first time in his life he’d seen such a map, when he discovered the African nation of Niger. So of course, apropos of nothing, in the middle of class, this kid bursts out yelling “Ni99ER!!” Not once but several times. Like he was having a fit, a racist paroxysm.\n \nThe kid just could not believe that there was an African nation named “Niger” which he pronounced with a hard ‘g’. The teacher explained that it was pronounced as Niger, not “Nigger” and tried to explain something about the root of the word… The kid laughed, and cackled, and from that day forward referred to black people as “Nigers” and cackled hysterically about it. For a couple years, until we graduated, it seemed like that kid’s main interest in life was ridiculing the fact that a nation called Niger existed, and conflating that with the ‘n-word’ in every way possible. Oh, and for some weird reason, that kid always shouted and repeated the word “Flagstaff” whenever he heard it said by anyone else, in any context. He seemed to find the word ‘Flagstaff’ inherently hysterical, and after compulsively repeating it, he’d sit there and chuckle, shake his head, and marvel at the existence of such a place name for quite a while. “FLAGSTAFF!!! Harharhar”. Every. Single. Time. Niger and Flagstaff, endless amusement. That kid laughed constantly, mainly about those two things, demonstrating that ignorance really is bliss.\n \nOh, I just remembered another incident with that kid. In shop class, he was watching this other kid rip a 2x4 in half on the huge table saw. It was a long 2x4, ten feet or so, and when the kid finished the cut, the cutoff piece got trapped between the fence and blade, and that was a huge, powerful, industrial saw. It launched that 2x2 off the saw _hard_ and fast. I was standing there watching everything, off to the side. There were really grisly photos on the walls of that shop class of the possible injuries we could inflict on ourselves (or indeed on others) with the tools in the shop, and I took heed, was cautious and safety-oriented, and thankfully avoided injury. Our Southern friend, not so much. He had a cavalier attitude toward safety, and in this instance stood directly in line with the blade, and with the wood, so as to better observe the cut the other kid was making. Southern boy had his thumbs hooked in his belt, or his pockets, or something, elbows out, feet wide apart, when the lumber got launched off the saw, and it hit him right in the pubic bone. He went flying backward, crumpled over, folded in half, and hit a metal electrical box behind him so hard he dented it in, then collapsed. He was okay. I saw him in the shower later, and he had a square bruise where it hit him, bloody, green, purple…. It hit him really, really hard. It if would have been a couple inches lower, something awful would have happened, but it looked like it nearly broke his pubic bone. He said it was very painful. I made a mental note to keep staying out of the way of any possible launched hazards, and I’ve tried to live by that. Hopefully that kid learned some lessons, too. Though I kinda doubt it.\n \nThen, later in life, I actually spent some time in the Deep South, Georgia among other places. I worked for a plumber, so I was a plumber’s helper, technically. I’ve never seen anything like that. The guy I was working for was the most rabidly racist caricature of a Southerner imaginable. Literally every time we saw a black person while driving around, he’d have to call them an n-word. Since there were hundreds of black people about in Georgia, the guy spent about half his verbal output going niggerniggerniggernigger…. It was ridiculous. And every single time he saw a woman, any woman, he would say “I’d _FUCK_ her!” like a robot, every time.\n \nBut when he wasn’t being horribly racist or sexist, he was usually moaning in pain and begging for death. He took pills during the day, alarmingly often, for gastric distress. He moaned and clutched his belly “Oh Gawd damn it hurts! Ah wanna die it hurts so bad! Gawddamn pills ain’t no help neither!” After a couple days of this...", "authorship": "human"}

As a beginner, I had always wanted to build and maintain muscle mass. My ideal shape was athletic, strong.\n \nMy ideal shape was athletic & strong. I had aspired to look like this for a long time and lacked the knowledge and skills to move ahead with my plan.\n \nMy missing puzzle piece was training with weights. I was petrified!\n \nLike most females, I had fallen back into my insecure shell. I\n \nI would watch all these muscle men, with only a couple of women, \npounding, grunting and making faces \n(Actually, I was laughing at the facial expressions!).\n It’s still painful knowing in 2021, there are only a couple of women in the weights area. It’s still a space that men dominate.\nI admit, I was intimidated a lot and stuck to the usual weight bearing machines in the hope that some muscle would grow — and maybe I’d get some six-pack in the process, But that never happened, and my frustration continued to grow.\nTaking matters into my own hands was essential - that's why I invested in a personal trainer. It was great, but I didn't get the results I wanted. I didn't dedicate enough time to weight training or even structure my diet correctly.\n \nThat all changed when I decided I wanted to body build seriously and start showing my results on stage. That’s the scary bit — having your body scrutinised by judges and the audience. I didn’t care; I knew I could build the body I wanted. It was somewhere growing inside of me, and I just needed a proper coach — and to commit.\nThen and there, my weight training journey began, and it hasn’t stopped since.\nLearning new things on this journey never stops. There are always pit stops and pivots during the stages of ageing and hormonal shifts. Then when you throw lockdowns in the mix, things can get pretty heated. Here's is the best of the best during my 15-year journey of bodybuilding and nutrition.\n \nUse multi joining movements\n.\n \n(squats, lunges, deadlifts, bench pressing, pull-ups) to use the most muscle groups. These movements develop an athletic, shapely physique, burn more calories, strength and muscle mass. Using this technique every time you train will increase your results and get to your training goals faster. It has never failed me along the bodybuilding journey.\n \nDon't shy away from the intense movements.\n \nI see a lot of people disregarding squats, deadlifts and chin-ups. I know these are challenging, but throwing yourself into challenging movements will create successful results — and fast.\n \nThere are instances when your doctor doesn’t recommend a particular exercise — that’s fine.\n \nBut what I’d like to point out is that not using these muscle groups will produce weakness in your skeletal system, leading to problems in the future.\n \nI would follow my doctor’s advice, and if I can do something, I’d start very small. As you increase the weights you lift or the intensity of bands. Your body becomes stronger and will tolerate tension and load.\n \nDon’t allow injured muscles to become so weak that they no longer help you lead a normal life. Make use of what you can do to keep strong and active.\n \nNutrition is key to your success.\n \nIt doesn’t matter if you want to get leaner or build muscle — nutrition is your best friend. Assess your food choices, and adapt according to your needs. Those who want to lose weight will have different requirements than those who build muscle.\n \nOne big question I get is, \"can I do both at the same time?\" Well, sure you can, but one will outweigh the other. Too much cardio can lead to loss of muscle mass. Weight training more than four times a week can lead to less effective results & burnout - and worst still, injury. There needs to be a balance of both mediums.\n \nHow do you discover this balance? No one can tell you what works for your body better than you can. It's a matter of getting into the trenches, trying things out, experimenting and writing down your results.\n \nOver time, you will discover the dos and do not’s of your body. Unfortunately, there is no easy answer for this — it takes hard work and a lot of guessing — and it keeps changing as you age.\n \nLet yourself off the hook, throw perfectionism out the window, do your best, and your best is the right place to start.\n \nKnowing what to do and performing it correctly are two different things.\n \nExecuting movements with weights is one of the main reasons why I first hired a personal trainer.\nI wanted someone to tell me exactly what I should do and how to structure my posture correctly.\nI tried to get specific results, and it was easy to get the skills from a person who was already way ahead in the game.\n \nI applied their techniques and skills. Over time, I trained with a couple of other experts who brought even more skills for my success.\n \nThe easiest way to master weight training was because I asked for help. If I had done it myself, it wouldn’t have happened.\n \nThe journey ahead never ends\n.\n \nThere will be endless points in your life where the journey changes.\nWe start to age, we change professions, have a family, experience hormonal shifts or develop an illness.\nThese issues can be very frustrating to anyone that has trained for many years. Things we did ten years ago don't work today.\n \nBut this is life telling us we need to change, alter and find a different way.\n \nThat could mean training a lot less, recovering more, watching your nutrition like a hawk, or trying intermittent fasting. The alternatives are endless, but start with one thing at a time and wait. Along my bodybuilding journey, I ate 5 -6 meals a day.\n \nBack then, I was about 35. Now at 42, I can't handle that many meals, and I'm just not as hungry as I once was. So we just have to make do with what is presented to us right now.\n \nI want to finish this off by saying that when you have a goal In mind, you will then look for the means to attract those results. I always had a set idea of what I wanted.\n \nOnce you've achieved your goal, moving on to something else will keep the flame of fitness alive.\n \nAs we grow up, we develop a love for other things. Perhaps for you, it may be pushing your body to its limit.\n \nMaybe someone else might decide to take up yoga as well. The remarkable aspect of fitness, no matter what age, you can try an array of things to find out what starts to ignite an emotional trigger within you. For me, that's always been weight training.\n \nThere is no other form of exercise that ticks all the boxes for my needs, wants and wishes.\n \nWhat will yours be?\n \nPlease also join me on my various social platforms and do go ahead and download your \n40 Fat Loss Tips & Portions guide.\n I'm also on \nInstagram\n & \nMedium", "authorship": "human"}

Studies consistently show that full body routines cause better fat loss, often double or more of that of a split routine. (see chart below, -5.7% fat loss for full body, vs -2.1% for split group)\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885621/\nTriple the fat loss and triple the muscle growth? Sign me up!\nMore frequent \npractice \nwith the movements-that could explain why the bench results were very similar above (simple movement) but the full body group got better squat gains (more complex movement). They just had more \npractice\n.\nSorry…I just love that video.\n \nFull body routine disadvantages\nThey’re \nhard\n. This is BY FAR the main reason people gravitate towards bro splits. Mentally, going into the gym and working your entire body just is on another plane of existence in terms of difficulty compared to just working one chunk of muscle, even if the volume is the same. It’s easy to tap out when you have to do front squats, RDLs, bench press, overhead press, seated rows, pulldowns, lateral raises, curls, extensions and ab wheel all in the same day.\nPerhaps because of this, they can be tough on your \nhormone levels\n. Check the above chart; the full body testosterone went up 11%, but the split went up 21%! Keep in mind this was just four weeks, working out just three times per week, as well. Keeping up a full body protocol all the time, for higher volumes could \nprobably \nlead to reductions in T for some people.\nThey give you \nless time \nto \nrecover\n. This is part of the reason that I really am sure to use a lot of variety in my training when incorporating higher frequency. If you use the same movements all the time, be prepared for your joints to be unhappy. You need to vary the movement patterns enough that it shifts the stress on the joints at least slightly.\nSplit routine advantages\nMore \nrecovery time \nfor each body part between workouts.\nMight have better satellite cell activation (check the answer below) due to the \nincreased concentrated workload \nand greater \nmuscle damage\n. \nGeoffrey Verity Schofield's answer to How fast does lost muscle grow back with muscle memory?\nGet a \nbetter pump\n-doing more work in one session can lead to greater metabolic stress for that muscle.\nCan help you develop a better \nmind-muscle connection. \nYes, that’s a real thing, especially for the upper body.\nCauses increased \nsoreness\n, which can facilitate growth and let you “feel” that muscle better. This could be a disadvantage if you don’t like this feeling…I personally kinda like it for some twisted reason.\nSplit routine disadvantages\nLower frequency \nper muscle group. This is probably the biggest reason why split routines suck. You do chest on Monday (obviously), and your chest is really only growing for about 36–48hours afterwards. There are 168 hours of the week-why would you only have each muscle group growing 20–30% of the time? \nNot optimal! \nFull body routines can get that number up to 70–80+% for the entire body, which explains the massive difference in both muscle gain and fat loss.\nYou \ncan \nactually \nLOSE muscle\n. In the above example, you’re growing on Monday, Tuesday and maybe Wednesday. You might be maintaining on Thursday and Friday. But especially if you are cutting or not getting in enough protein, or not sleeping well, it’s entirely possible for the weekend to be in a catabolic state.\nNot that kind of Weaknd; he’s in a catabolic state 24/7\nYou can \nlose “touch” \nwith an exercise. This isn’t gonna happen with bicep curls or lateral raises, but with something like squatting or Olympic lifting, it’s entirely possible for the nervous system to slightly forget how to do these movements if you’re only doing them once per week.\nAll in all, I’d do full body \nmost \nof the time, but if you hit a plateau, splitting up your routine can be a nice change of pace.\n \nYou’ll have more time to recover, and can really focus on blasting a body part to force it to grow, perhaps through the aforementioned satellite cells. You can recover any hormonal or structural stress incurred during your full body bonanza.\n \nI’ve taken a page out of Eric Helm’s book\nand been doing full body workouts 4–6 times a week recently, and it’s been astonishingly effective. Tough…but the gains have been impressive.\n \nBut, I won’t do it for the rest of my life, as it’s not sustainable.\n \nCheck out my new \nSpace\n, \nfollow me on \nInstagram\n \nfor daily diet and training tips!

I mention this background, mainly because I think this American guy felt an itch to find out \nwhat’s going on… \nWe actually got a few stares as we were walking around, especially a few blue eyes straining at me! \nI wonder why…! \nI am actually very pesky at this, I just look at them with my usual smile.)\n \nShe: Hmm.. I’m surprised. What are religious people doing here?\n \nMe: Why? May be they want to see Romeo and Juliet?\n \nShe: Are they allowed entertainment?\n \nMe: Yeah, I think so. They are Buddhist monks, I’m sure they can have a little entertainment.\n \n(These two guys were wearing saffron robes, and I can see a chakra imprinted on the side of their bag or something.)\n \nShe: (Chuckles) May be.

That’s my style! ^_^ ]\n \nMe: You know there’s a monk in India who belongs to a Hindu monastic order, but he says he is an atheist monk. And he is a well known mathematician.\n \nShe: What is an atheist Hindu monk?\n \nMe: Among Hindus, you can be an atheist. But, I don’t understand the part of being an atheist monk. May be he follows the discipline, may be he is spiritual but not religious? I don’t know..\n \nShe: Hmm.. That’s very different. I didn’t know monks can be like that..\n \nRandom White American Guy pops into our conversation uninvited ( with wife in tow— I am not sure if she is Indian or Latino, but she is brown, not white.

His name is Mahan Mj.\n \nJoe gives the most stupid ass look and rotates his head around that certain Americans give, which roughly means “Nah… I don’t buy that!”\n \nAt this point, I was a few seconds away from my natural reflex to such ignorant people: A small pause with quiet intent look at his eyes; a huge laugh, followed by “Are you a mathematician?” But, his wife knows how he has been making an ass of himself and this is a bit too much!

But after a few weeks, your strength will increase, and you will find yourself getting worn out. If you what to gain mass, you need to focus on individual parts of your body. It also depends if you want to be a body builder or just get big a strong. If you want to get big, just do compound movements, like squats, deadlifts, bench press and rowing movements for your back. Basically you are working your largest muscles, that will work you hard and burn 🔥 calories, and condition your cardio respiratory system. Even if you want to become a body builder, I believe that's where you would start. The smaller muscles with automatically grow because of the metabolic boost from working these large muscles. Do this for about 6 months. But always remember to learn the proper form for any movements you do. Go very light and build up. Squats for example, take some time to get comfortable doing. Do not rush to get huge. Safety and consistency and great nutrition, and make sure you are fully recovered between workouts. The growth and strength increases happen out of the gym. After six months, reevaluate, if you want to become a body builder, you can start doing your smaller muscles, like triceps, biceps, shoulders, forearms and calfs. One other very important caveat, learn to stretch your muscles after your workouts, not before. If you do not stretch regularly, our bodies get tight as we age and it leads to joint problems etc. I love to do zone 2 training on a bike or stationary bike, or I use the stair machine. Zone 2 is under the lactate threshold. Which means you can carry on a conversion for a couple of sentences but no so easy that you could sing a song. I use a heart rate monitor since the first came out I believe in the late eighties. I am 64, I have been doing fitness for 35 years consistently.

I love running too and he showed me it is possible. So, I told myself: \"One day, every day\"\n \nCautionary Tale from my First Attempt:\n \nThe first time I tried to streak was back in May 2020. Covid-19 shut down all the gyms, so \nrunning was my routine.\n I was doing well until Day 59 of the streak.\n \nThat morning, I remember \nfeeling physically and mentally exhausted\n before going out the run. My fatigue usually goes away after the first two miles, so I thought I would be good.\n \nI was running a different route through my city and side-stepped onto the gravel. My shoe kept sliding right over the gravel and I felt a pop. My ankle turned into a balloon!\n \nI could have avoided this misstep if I listened to my body. I was out for a few weeks after that.\n \nAnd so it goes.\n \nWhy I tried again:\n \nI have a strong motivation to \nmake fitness an unbreakable habit\n. After a few months of not being consistent with exercise, I was tired of making excuses. I decided to run first thing every morning before work.\n \nI asked myself three questions:\nWhy do I want to do this?\n Running is my favorite thing to do. The rush I get after a run helps me get through my day. The days when I wouldn't run I felt off mentally. I want to share that it is possible and inspire people to find a fitness habit that they love to do every day too.\nHow do I know I can do this?\n I had already been running for a long time. I have a base level of fitness. Covid-19 let me focus more on running and working remotely gave me more time. All I needed to do was balance harder runs with mostly easy recovery runs each week.\nWhat is my minimum?\n One mile a day. Even if I'm traveling or off the routine, I know I can fit one mile in. Make it easy.\nTips that worked for me:\nBuild a foundation \nof easy running over months or years before you start a run streak and keep easy days easy!\nThe first 100 days are the challenge\n. Each milestone (30, 60, 90, 100, 200, 300, 365 days) gives a huge mental boost to keep going. After 100, it becomes less physical and more mental.\nFollow Hellah Sedibe and thousands of runners\n who have been running every day (check out the 4000+ runners streaking on \nruneveryday\n Some have been doing it for 50+ years).\nIt feels good to start the day with a run. Good luck and stay healthy! 🙏\n \nEdit:\n \nI just wrote about \nhow to exercise every day\n after hitting Day 500. Check it out :)", "authorship": "human"}

I had an apolitical role in communications. One time during the summer tourist season we went out with a professional camcorder and asked people who George Bush was, only 1 in 10 knew who the vice president was.\n \nSo we switched the question to who was Ronald Reagan. Only 3 in 10 knew he was the President, with a few more saying he was an actor.

If you want the quality of The Rock or Matt Bomer's washboard abdominal muscles, or the speed or agility of Usain Bolt or Cam Newton, you have to work. If your goals are not so lofty (you want to feel good, maybe lose a few pounds, or just keep your place), then you still have to figure out how the fitness class will fit your life. Don't worry, through these strategies, no matter what kind of fitness \"guy\" you are, we can cover everyone.\nFor the guy who has no free time\n \nWe see, you are very busy, and sometimes the gym falls at the bottom of the to-do list. Sorry to say that if you are serious about health and wellness, it will not happen. When you seem to have spoken all the hours of the day, you must find ways to increase efficiency. For example, bring lunch so you can spend half of your rest time on exercise and the other half on eating. Or consider becoming an early riser so that you can exercise before life happens, and then suddenly finish the exercise.\n \nShort\n \nThe good news: exercise does not have to take a few hours to take effect. \"The minimum effective amount of exercise is 4 minutes, which is the time for a drum exercise,\" said Josh Holland, a trainer in New York City and founder of Zoomtion Fitness. So, why not start your day with squats or push-ups (20 seconds, 10 seconds rest, 8 reps) while making coffee?\n \nHard to go home\n \nThis is not to say that long-term exercise will not bring more benefits, although Holland said that you only need 20 to 30 minutes, especially when you are training hard. His favorite is your best partner, including slow repetitive high-intensity strength training, aerobic sprinting and endurance isometric tests.\n \nThis weight loss routine is the perfect partner exercise\n \nA cry for you\n \nStrengthen Strength: Choose 5 to 7 multi-joint exercises (such as front squat, overhead press, bench press, low row exercise and pull down exercise), and perform slow repetitive exercises (concentric and eccentric) for about one and a half minutes for each exercise Exercise 5-6 seconds), respectively. Holland said: \"The weight should be heavy enough to make you tired.\"\n \nFor aerobic exercise: choose aerobic exercise mode (running, biking, rowing, even skipping). Go all out for 12 to 15 seconds. Indeed not, do your best, this is not a half-way time. Recover up to one minute (up to three minutes), and then recover 6 to 10 times. Holland said: \"When your distance starts to shrink, then it's time for you to quit.\"\n \nFor long-lasting: This fast exercise can be done in your living room using your own body weight. Use wall sitting, planks, handstands or spear rests and lunges rest to create isometric circuits. Move continuously for 1 minute at a time and complete the loop as much as possible until the table fails. Make it more difficult by extending the time.\n \nFor those who are not motivated\n \nFor whatever reason, when you stretch your hips toward the gym, you seem to be dragging your feet. It’s not that you are afraid of it, but because it’s much easier to procrastinate or get yourself into work, such as Netflix or aimless web surfing or coworkers’ happy hours, and suddenly, you are not for the week.\n \nSet a goal\n \nYou’ve heard it before, but if you don’t have a clear intention, it’s difficult to measure progress and you don’t even have the motivation to try. Add numbers to it, such as the specific weight loss you want to achieve within a specific time period (remember that 2 pounds a week is considered healthy and sustainable). Or consider the goal of skill or strength: perfect skipping leg training, lift body weight (or 1.5 times or twice the body weight) on the bench or deadlift, pull up 10 or 20 pull-ups, master the muscles, and start Exercise the number of miles within a certain time frame and so on. \"Using test and retest models,\" Holland said. Set a benchmark and then conduct a self-test once a week or every two weeks to assess progress.\n \nLet others hold you accountable\n \nAn exercise partner who is already a gym rat may be your new best friend. Cheer him up by asking for his opinion, suggesting to provide a whistleblower, or keeping up with him, you need someone to whip your ass. Or even promise to pay for the smoothie after exercise to help you get up and drag you there, and don’t let him refuse.", "authorship": "human"}

Use leg-press machines and leg extensions to workout your quadriceps and leg curl and seated calf raises to workout your hamstrings and calves respectively for first few weeks.\n \n4)Shoulders\n \nInstead of doing lifting exercises, do raising ones like dumbbell front raise, lateral raise, bent over lateral raise.\n \n5) Arms (Biceps and Triceps)\n \nThere is not really much to pay attention while working out your arms except for the posture while doing biceps dumbbell/barbell curl ‘coz people tend to use a jerk while lifting which leads to bending the waist backwards which in some cases results very dangerous if the weight is heavy.\n \nHope it helps..Happy gyming..", "authorship": "human"}

Growth hormone will allow you to build a tighter/leaner physique. \n \nSince diet is 80% of any fitness goal, I'd stick to lean protein + veggies 5 times a day. Drink plenty of water in between meals. Have a refeed, carb heavy meal for one of your meals every 4th or 5th day. This will keep your fat burning hormones charged.

For one year, I was attending services at her temple (as a “family member” not required to convert) and singing in that choir; while attending services and singing in a Methodist church down the street from our home.\n \nThe Rabbi had no problem with my going both places. The Cantor (also music director) had no problems with it. The Pastor certainly didn’t object, nor did their Choir Director.\n \nOnly one person ever complained, an old woman at the Methodist Church who told me that it was a sin for me to worship Friday nights at the Jewish Temple. She also said that the TV Network was airing “The Ten Commandments” on Easter Evening that year as part of a Jewish plot to keep a Christian movie from being aired on Easter.\n \nShe just could not understand when I pointed out that “The Ten Commandments” is just as much a Christian movie as it is a Jewish movie.", "authorship": "human"}

Holding my arms up like this is exhausting.”\n \n…\n \nI hope you know none of that’s true.\n \nI do pump myself up before a big lift sometimes.\n \nIt can indeed be awkward.\n \nSlaps are given. Music is played. Grunts are, embarrassing as it is in retrospect, made.\n \nBut while I use it as a tool, I don’t rely on feelings of motivation, for reasons we’re about to get to.\n \nThe term motivation is used and abused too much and too vaguely. Before we can talk about it, we need to firmly define what it means.\n \nWhen discussing others, most agree that motivation is \nthe desire that drives their actions.\n \nSimple, right?\n \nBut when we’re talking about ourselves—and perhaps most specifically when we speak of notoriously hard to improve aspects of our lives—that’s \nnot\n the meaning we give it.\n \nWe then start mixing it up, with this mythical \nfeeling \nthat will be able to generate the energy required for us to behave in a particular way.\n \nWe tend to also treat it as a prerequisite; as if this feeling has to be present before we do a given thing.\n \n“I’m not motivated today.”\n \n“When am I going to be motivated again?”\n \n“I need some motivation before I start.”\n \nNotice however, that nowhere in the first definition does it say that one has to \nfeel\n motivation. It only speaks of the desire driving action. If I told you Usain Bolt was motivated to train for the Olympics, that only means he has a goal he values in his sights—not that every moment of his experience is filled with feelings of motivation. Point being, that \nthese two definitions of motivation are not the same thing.\n \nAnd that is a \nvery\n good thing.\nContrary to how we treat them, feelings aren’t instructions we should follow, sent from the deep, all-knowing core inside of us.\n \nThere is at least no evidence of that.\n \nThe unsexy, best guess of a truth we currently have is that\n feelings are our brains best interpretations of outward stimuli \nbased on our personal biology, history, personality, expectations and culture.\n[1]\n \n[2]\n \n[3]\n \n[4]\n \nAlso, as the high-school version of me would tell you: feelings are fickle beasts.\n \nNot constant, but fluctuating.\n \nNot rational, but irrational.\n \nNo one feels pulsating motivation \nall the time,\n just like no one feels constant anger, happiness or joy.\n \nDoing something you’re not used to doing, it’s in fact very likely you’ll not \nfeel\n much motivation—at least at first. Rarely do we like doing that we’re bad at.\n \nSo \n“motivation the feeling”\n shouldn’t matter.\n \nWhat should is the \noverarching desire\n that drives our actions, even—and perhaps especially—when we don’t particularly feel like performing those actions.\n \nWhat drives people to train everyday and what we need isn’t \nmotivation\n, but \ndedication\n.\n \nDedication, to a goal we’ve set ourselves.\n \nDedication, to being who we want to be.\n \nDedication, to what \nmotivates us\n.\n \nNo one wants to eat vegetables, drag themselves to the gym and go to bed early. These are not sexy, fun or appealing things to do. The only reason why some do them is because they’re dedicated to an overarching goal, desire or way of life they value.\n \nBut is doing whatever you want to do going to be a constant uphill battle? Are you never going to like it?\n \nThe good news is that’s highly unlikely.\n \nIf you’re anything like most people, you’ll enjoy it more and more the more time you spend doing it.\n \nAs stated, we like doing things we’re good at and we become good at that which we do. It’s a \npositive feedback loop.\nOne action spurs another, which again spurs the original action.\n \nFurthermore, we mostly don’t operate based on momentary desire. Virtually no one contemplates how they feel about brushing their teeth or weighs the pros and cons of cutting their nails.\n \nDoing so would be exhausting and extremely inefficient.\n \nMost of our decisions are made blindly, out of habit. That which we do everyday is treated just as things to be done. Exercise becomes very much the same way.\n \nIt’s also important to notice how motivation and dedication are not on opposite sides of the spectrum. One does not take away from the other. In fact, they’re symbiotic, feeding off of each other.\n \nThe stronger your motivation—being the \nthing\n, the \ngoal\n, the \ndesire\n that motivates you—the easier it is to dedicate yourself to it. The more you’re able to dedicate yourself to something, the more motivated you’ll feel, because you’re now accomplishing what motivates you, and few things are more motivating than sensing progress towards a goal we value.\n \nMost often, it works like this in practice:\nFind something that motivates you.\n As we’ve gone over, this doesn’t mean something you’ll enjoy doing 100% of the time, but simply something that’ll make you happy/successful in the long run.\nDedicate yourself to it.\n You’ll inevitably, for a moment or 100, not want to do it. Do it anyway.\nDo it for a long enough time that it becomes ingrained. \nYou’ll have to fight less and less to do it. Some days, you’ll still have to though. That’s life.\nToo many people accept blindly the idea that they need to feel motivated to do something. That which we decide as true shape our vision of the world.\n \nIf reaching your goal is something that’s important to you, I strongly recommend leaving that crowd and the idea that feelings of motivation are a prerequisite for action behind.\n \nDon’t depend on a fleeting feeling. Depend on what will make you happiest in the long run.\n \nMotivation will come and go.\n \nIt rises, like the ocean, then it sinks again.\n \nAnd you’ll be there. Still going strong. Still working.\n \nWith it.\n \nWithout it.\nTo answer your question directly: No one feels motivated to workout every day. People simply do so because of their habits, environment and identity. If you want to be more consistent in the gym, those are the things you should aim to change, not your feelings of motivation.\nFootnotes\n[1] \nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/feeling-our-emotions/\n[2] \nWhy Your Biology Runs on Feelings - Issue 56: Perspective - Nautilus\n[3] \nhttps://humdev.uchicago.edu/sites/humdev.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shweder/2008--The%20Cultural%20Psychology%20of%20the%20Emotions%20-%20Ancient%20and%20Renewed.PDF\n[4] \nhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.577.4057&rep=rep1&type=pdf", "authorship": "human"}

I believe the democratisation of publishing through the internet and the D-K effect are responsible for the rise of \"the endarkenment\", where ignorance is celebrated, and all opinions are thought equally true.", "authorship": "human"}

I am being very polite, which I suggest as a basic approach when you don’t understand what you are seeing. I get done listening to the Choir practice (Practices are open for free listening, or they were then, and it was GREAT).\n \nI decide to go look at this other building with dioramas in it. I figure out they are based on Scenes From Scripture, and I can identify the Old and New Testament scenes, but I’m quite lost on the ones from the Book of Mormon.\n \nI am stopped in front of a scene. A man is sitting in a chair, at a desk, with a flip-a-page desk calendar on it, model about 1930 to 1970, sheets mounted on central U brads, but made of something like a brassy version of tinfoil rather than paper. He is dressed as a Mayan, and there are cubbyholes built into a wall behind him, filled with clay tablets covered in cuneiform writing. There are patterns like Mayan glyphs painted on the wall to mark the cubbyholes. This looks to me like a complete archaeological mash-up.\n \nAt this point, one of the local insiders walks up with a friend, gestures to the scene, and proclaims, “See? This proves everything in (Scripture) is true!”\n \nShe means that the written scripture, first published in English in the 1800s, is proved scientifically verifiable by a diorama constructed in the late 1900s. Now, if she were talking about something I know about, and expect has a historical basis, say the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, it wouldn’t be proved to have happened because somebody put together a museum exhibit about it after the fact. I am not familiar with the story she is referencing, but it will follow the same rules as to evidence. It will take archaeology and cross references, not just a realistic looking artist’s conception \nbased on the book itself\n, to \nstart\n into evidence territory.\n \nThis stunning display of literal minded concrete thinking has me almost physically dizzy. If I were a cartoon character, springs would be sticking out of my head, waving about and making accordion noises.\n \nI stand there thinking, she is probably a nice person to her family and neighbors. For the love of Mike, keep your trap shut. I manage to reel back outside, without speaking, fortunately, and try to figure out all the self-referential permutations of wackiness in her statement. I’m still not sure I have a grasp on that.\n \nIt isn’t that it was about a religion I don’t understand that made the statement so staggering to me, but the utter lack of understanding of how to establish whether something is real.

Not exactly deep or original stuff…I’d consider having my room paid for all weekend a pretty good deal tbh.\n \nAnyway, someone in our group had been penfriends with her and even met her once or twice, and we arranged a meal with about 10 people attending. When time for the meal came, Ms Primadonna had not shown up. She sent a message she was still coming. Everyone sat down, but didn’t order as it would be rude if we started before she got there. Time goes by…lots of time. Another message comes—she has a migraine, but she’s still coming. We wait. And wait. Another half hour or more goes by. We are now all starving and not sure what to do. Then ta-da, Primadonna finally swans into the room and plonks herself at the head of the table like a queen. No hello for anyone, a miserable, sour face. (OK, she had a migraine—why not just cancel if she felt that bad? I am a migraineur myself—doesn’t turn me into a jerk.)\n \nShe grabs the menu, more facial grimaces. “Ugh, I don’t like any of this…and guess what, when I went to the drugstore they don’t have the same painkillers as in America! I’m not taking anything foreign! I can’t believe i can’t get proper drugs!”\n \nSilence started to fall over the table. Her tone was petulant, unfriendly and accusatory. Being mostly Brits/Canadians and a little more reserved than she was, no one said, “Why would you think you’d get the same painkillers?’ although you could tell everyone was thinking it.\n \nShe continued to moan about the menu and didn’t order; the rest of us finally ordered food. Primadonna didn’t seem to like the fact no one was continuously fussing about her headache/lack of drugs and suddenly said, “I have to go’ and disappeared from the restaurant. We tried to make excuses for her because she felt unwell but…\n \nShe was back at it the next day. I was going to buy her book but ahead of me, I saw a fan go up to her table, buy her stuff then ask for a photograph of her. She flung up a hand to her head in a melodramatic way like some dame in a panto. “Go on but I’ve had a headache…” she whined, all passive aggressive, making her FAN seriously uncomfortable and embarrassed.( There are nicer ways to say ‘no’, and if you are attending an event, you are in the public eye. Not one of the real celebs attending were anything like this.)\n \nLater on Primadonna cornered my friend ( the penfriend) while she was walking in the hall with me and another lady. Now came the really cringey stuff. “There…there is DUST in my room,” she said, almost tremulously as if about to cry. Her lower lip was so outthrust in a pout, I thought she might trip on it. “I ran my finger along the ledge and saw it on my fingertip.”\n \n(This was an old building, her room was free, and if there was dust in her room, it wasn’t in mine or anyone else’s!)\n \n“Couldn’t you ask housekeeping to clean it?” my friend mumbled.\n \nPrimadonna rolled her eyes to heaven. “This is terrible! Dust! They can’t treat me like this! They can’t do this to me-I’M AN AMERICAN!”\n \nThere were three of us there besides Primadonna. A stunned silence fell. No one quite knew where to look after this cringe-worthy outburst.\n \nMe and one other English girl hastily made our excuses and left the hall, unable to bear it anymore. The girl looked at me once we were out of earshot and started to laugh, “What a horrible, entitled, rude person!”\n \nWe avoided Primadonna after that but heard her tell people she was a black belt in karate, which seemed pretty implausible given her rather, um, unfit physique and the fact that every ache, pain or inconvenience was a big issue.\n \nLater we heard she could not cope with the U.K. and cut her whole ‘research’ trip short and went home to the US early, losing loads of money! I guess she couldn’t handle the fact no one was falling all over her, catering to every whim just because she was American and wrote some fanfics.\n \nLater the friend who’d met her in the past said, “I have no idea why she was freaking out about the dust.

Daily full-body training can lead to fatigue and overtraining, especially if the workouts are intense.\nInjury Risk\n: Without adequate recovery, the risk of injury increases due to wear and tear on muscles and joints.\nPlateaus\n: Constantly doing full-body workouts without variation may lead to plateaus in strength and muscle gains.\nRecommendations:\nListen to Your Body\n: If you feel fatigued or sore, consider taking rest days or alternating with lighter workouts.\nVary Intensity\n: You might do high-intensity workouts a few times a week and lighter sessions or active recovery on other days.\nIncorporate Rest Days\n: Aim for at least one or two rest days per week to allow for muscle recovery.\nUltimately, the best approach depends on your individual goals, fitness level, and how your body responds to training. If you’re unsure, consulting a fitness professional can provide personalized guidance.", "authorship": "human"}

The owners had always treated us nicely, and knowing the situation they went out of their way to make me feel at home there. The restaurant had an open kitchen set off by a counter. I could sit there on my own without feeling self-conscious about it, and talk with the owners.\n \nThe owners’ oldest son went off to college so they had hired a young woman, 19 or 20 years old, to work as a waitress. After a couple of months, the owners started talking about setting us up. I treated it as a joke, but the third or fourth time the owners brought it up the young lady said she would be interested. I got the feeling she was being a good employee and just playing along. and I didn’t feel ready to start dating. The age difference seemed a bit much to me, too, so I made excuses.\n \nI couldn’t deny, though, that she was very, very pretty, and in our limited interaction she was very friendly, and the owners were very, very persistent… So I finally asked her out to a movie and then afterward we went to a pub for a drink and dessert.

Trying to find something that we could talk about was painful!\n \nEventually, I did mention where I worked, and it turned out that her father worked for the same company. He had worked there all her life. Finally, there was an opening to ask a follow-up question! It was a big computer company, and I didn’t recognize her father’s name, so I asked what kind of work he did. She had no idea! I tried to lead her through it: engineering, sales, finance, HR, legal, manufacturing, hardware, software… Nothing rang a bell! She did know that the company made computers, but that was the extent of it. She had never seen her father’s office, never absorbed or asked any questions about what he did.

However, I fear her Stupidity, Dogmatism, and & Anti-Intellectualism will pass as “intelligent musings” under a Trump Presidency. “Oh, youbetcha’” Maybe a White House position, \n“Secretary of Bad Speeches?”\nI’ll let her insipid words demonstrate my point:\n \n“We believe that the best of America is in these small towns that we get to visit, and in these wonderful little pockets of what I call the real America, being here with all of you hardworking, very patriotic, um, very, um, pro-America areas of this great nation.”\n \n“You mentioned education, and I'm glad that you did. I know education you are passionate about with your wife being a teacher for 30 years, and God bless her. Her reward is in heaven, right?” \nDoh? Heaven? How about a livable paycheck?\n \nWhen Katie Couric asked Palin the “complex trick question” of where she gets her news, the two women had the following exchange:\n \nCouric: “And when it comes to establishing your world view, I was curious, what newspapers and magazines did you regularly read before you were tapped for this -- to stay informed and to understand the world?”\n \nPalin: “I've read most of them again with a great appreciation for the press, for the media…”\n \nCouric: “But what ones specifically? I'm curious.”\n \nPalin: “Um, all of them, any of them that have been in front of me over all these years.” \nWhere, in the dentist’s office?\n \nCouric: “Can you name any of them?\n \nPalin: \n“I have a vast variety of sources where we get our news.”\n \nOne sure sign of an imbecile is referring oneself in the plural, “we.”\n \nIn 2010, while speaking at a fundraiser at California State University. Sarah Palin made the mistake of claiming that Eureka College, which is in Illinois, was in California.\n \"This is Reagan country. Yeah! And perhaps it was destiny that the man who went to California's Eureka College would become so woven within and inter-linked to the Golden State.\" \nDoh?\n \nIn 2010, Sarah Palin referred to Kodiak Island as the largest island in the United States. \n\"As we work and sightsee on America's largest island, we'll get to view more majestic bears, so now is a good time to draw attention to the political equivalent of the species.” \nSorry Sarah, but that would be Hawaii, and what is the “political equivalent of species?”\n \n“Hey, the more they’re pouring it on, the more I’m going to bug the crap out of them by being out there, with a voice, with the message, Hopefully running for office in the future too … Bless their hearts, those haters out there. They don’t understand that it invigorates me. It wants me to get out there and defend the innocent…”\n \nWhile at a motorcycle rally in 2011. Sarah Palin dropped this unforgettable quote,\n “\nI love that smell of the emissions!” \nHow about the taste? A little viscous and salty, I hear.\n \n“Maybe our kids could be defended against criminals on the spot if more Mama Grizzlies carried [guns]. And [the] Obama administration wants you ID’d for that? Well, then go ahead and carry a sign too. A sign that says ‘Yeah, I carry a gun because a cop is too heavy.’” Then, \nsaying that creating gun-free zone schools and other public buildings is “stupid on steroids.”\n Yes, she’s truly an expert on stupid.\n \nIn 2011, while, on the O’Reilly Factor, Sarah Palin was asked how she’d fix the Oil spill in the Gulf. Her insightful response was, \n“The Dutch and the Norwegians, they are known for dikes and for cleaning up water and for dealing with spills.”\n \nIn 2010, while, on the Glenn Beck Show, Palin was asked how she would deal with rising tensions between North and South Korea. Her response, \n\"\nBut obviously, we've got to stand with our North Korean allies.\"\n \nAnd my personal favorite: In 2011, when asked about Paul Revere’s midnight ride, Palin had this to say. \n\"He who warned, uh, the British that they weren't gonna be takin' away our arms, uh, by ringing those bells, and um, makin' sure as he's riding his horse through town to send those warning shots and bells that we were going to be sure and we were going to be free, and we were going to be armed.\"\n \nMs. Palin is a stunning example of the \n“Dunning-Kruger Effect”\n in action, which basically maintains that \nthere are people so stupid that they don’t even realize they are stupid\n, and see themselves as clever.\n \n“The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which low-ability individuals suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their ability as much higher than it really is. Dunning and Kruger attributed this bias to a metacognitive incapacity, on the part of those with low ability, to recognize their ineptitude and evaluate their competence accurately.” \nDunning–Kruger effect - Wikipedia\n \nSee also: \nThe Psychological Quirk That Explains Why You Love Donald Trump\n \nNuff said? “You Betcha!”", "authorship": "human"}

So if you want big and strong muscles that can withstand the test of time and whatever life throws at you, I recommend you do both. Follow a varied routine that challenges your body in both ways, one week of each, constantly alternating. Doing the same workout every week is both boring and not productive. There is no magical number of sets. When going for mechanical stress it is possible to achieve the desired effect after only 1 set, just make sure warming up properly. When the muscle tissue is torn and damaged, it will start a regenerating process that rebuilds and reinforces the damaged area. Normally it is ok to perform 2 and even 3 sets of this kind of tissue-breaking training, and 2 exercises will be plenty, making sure to hit the muscle from different angles and causing growth in a large area. \n \nFor the metabolical stress effect you will need more reps and less weights, but again- there is no magical number of exercises. Do as many as you want to, and I recommend you superset them or giantset them, in order to hit the same muscle from many different angles, all in one highrep round of exercises. I like to do 3 exercises on each musclegroup, for 3 rounds of trisets, when doing this kind of training. It can come up to a total of 45 reps on one round, doing 15 reps on 3 exercises with no rest in between, on the same muscle. it will give you the most insane feeling of pump, and surely cause a very good environment for growth. The levels of natural growth hormones is highly affected by this, and this is the reason why people call the high-rep range hypertrophy training. It usually takes 3 exercises to train a muscle from all the relevant angles/lengths, so that answers your question I guess.", "authorship": "human"}

This is an incredibly apt summary of Trump’s life to date. Idolatry, greed, and sexual immorality are intertwined in individual lives and whole societies. Sexuality is designed to be properly ordered within marriage, a relationship marked by covenant faithfulness and profound self-giving and sacrifice. To indulge in sexual immorality is to make oneself and one’s desires an idol. That Trump has been, his whole adult life, an idolater of this sort, and a singularly unrepentant one, should have been clear to everyone.\n \n“And therefore it is completely consistent that Trump is an idolater in many other ways. He has given no evidence of humility or dependence on others, let alone on God his Maker and Judge. He wantonly celebrates strongmen and takes every opportunity to humiliate and demean the vulnerable. He shows no curiosity or capacity to learn.

No don’t use google translate to talk to me. That stuff isn’t accurate. 4. Malta is in Europe and part if the European Union. No it’s not in Africa. 5. We have our flag, our government, our independance. No we aren’t part of the British colony anymore, like many Brits seem to think. 6. Italians please not everyone here knows Italian. 7. For the rest of the world, sorry not all of us speak English fluently, it is still considered a foreign language for most of us. 8.

The question always start out the same.  “I want to get stronger…” and then the caveats kick in.  “…but I don’t want to get more muscular…” or “…I don’t want to put on weight…”  These questions ask for the impossible.  If you want to get stronger, the only way is to increase your muscle size and density.  Period.  Granted, you could lose fat and build muscle and still weigh the same, but I assure you, when this happens, you WILL look more muscular, and that’s not a bad thing.\n \nIt appears that you’re looking to increase your functional strength as opposed to your gym strength.  To build functional strength, compound movements are the best way to go.  Compound movements are Olympic type lifts that require you to transition from one large muscle group to another large muscle group.  For instance, in the power-clean, you go from a deadlift start and end up standing with the weight pressed above your head.  Obviously you will not be able to clean as much weight as you would if you were doing a normal deadlift since you will have to press the weight over your head.\n \nThe difficulty I have in suggesting a customized training plan for anyone that I don’t get to work with in the gym is that everyone is different in their strengths and weaknesses and while one lifter may have more endurance, another may have more explosive power.  These two lifters will respond differently to a set workout and it’s up to a good coach to recognize when to push one aspect (explosive power) or the other (higher reps).\n \nGenerally, to build muscle strength and density, you should use a pyramid scheme that focuses on at least five sets, excluding your first and maybe your second set which is merely a warmup.  After your warmup with extremely light weights, your next three lifts will incrementally build up to your last two sets, which is where the work and growth really begins.  Your last two sets should be at a weight where you are on the verge of struggling, while keeping good form.  On the bench, your last two sets should require your spotter to keep a careful eye on your lifting, ready to assist if necessary.\n \nIf you’re lifting heavy weights, then the number of sets you should do will increase because you’re need more sets to safely work up to your max weight, and your muscles will need more work to get to the top weight.  For instance, approximately 8 weeks through a 13 week lifting cycle is when I want to start hitting certain milestones to ensure I will be at the top of my game come competition time.  Here’s a typical example of my bench workout.\nWarmup with just the bar;\nWarmup with just the bar;\n10 reps at 135;\n6 reps at 185;\n6 reps at 225;\n6 reps at 275;\n6 reps at 315;\n6 reps at 345 - This is my working set\n6 reps at 375 - This is the second of my working set.\nAlthough this “routine” seems pretty standard, the importance of having a good coach cannot be understated.  What my coach would do is watch how easy I did a set, then calculate what the next weight would be.  For instance, if on #7 I slowed down on rep 5 & 6, meaning my explosive power was waning, he would either make me rest a bit more to allow me to recover more, but not too much, or on set #8, he may move the weight only to 330.  The object is to be able to hit your working weight and complete it almost to exhaustion.  If I was having a particularly bad day, I may take out a set and adjust the weight accordingly.  What was most important is hitting your working sets and completing them.  This is important for several reasons, but the primary reason you want to complete your working sets is psychological.  When it comes down to it, it doesn’t matter what weight you lifted on set#6, or even if you have a set #6, what matters is you hit your goal for that week.  You’re setting yourself up for success the following week by being successful this week.\n \nIt is so important to hit your goals that even on weeks where I found myself stronger than expected, i.e. I blew through my first working set without any issue and it feels like I can add another 50# for my second working set with no problem, instead of increasing my goal for that week, I was told to focus on more explosion or better form and technique instead of adding additional pounds to that week’s goal.  What the coach may then do is recalculate \nnext\n week’s goal a bit higher.\n \nI guess the take away from this long winded answer is to set a lifting cycle for at least three months.  Start the first week by doing approximately six sets for eights, the second week, drop off a rep and do six sets for seven, increasing each successive set’s weight more than the week before.  You should be able to handle this as you’re taking away a rep.  Next week, drop a rep and increase the weight….\n \nIt’s important to set a goal and take the necessary incremental steps to reach that goal.  Some people go to they gym with the attitude of “I want to get stronger”, which is good, but difficult to achieve because it is so ambiguous.  However, if you say “Today I can do a max one rep bench at 225 and in 12 weeks I want to be able to max at 275” that is a goal that can be tracked accurately and you can adjust your weights, sets, reps, diet, sleeping accordingly.  At the end of the 12 weeks, hit your goal then take a week away from the gym, maybe a bit more, then come back and say “Today I can do a max one rep bench at 275 and in 12 weeks I want to be able to max at 315.”  Then, you chalk up your hands and get to work.", "authorship": "human"}

This creates a false sense of awareness around the world, and ignorance in America. The truth is, an Italian might know all the current events in American politics, but they probably have no idea what’s going on in Senegal, West Africa. Someone in Columbia might have seen the newest film release from Hollywood, but they don’t have a clue who the most popular pop star is in South Korea, etc. etc. etc. And for that matter, I’ve been met with blank stares from people from Switzerland, the UK, Austria, Australia, etc. when I say I’m from Pennsylvania. They don’t know where Pennsylvania is (just south of New York—they know that one); they just know where America is.\n \nKnowing where America is without knowing where the individual states are is, geographically speaking, not that different from knowing where Europe is, but not knowing the exact borders of each country.

They allow you to get into neutral grips more easily (which also tend to be nicer on the shoulders).\nThey allow you to train rotational patterns with greater ease (there are landmine exercises you can do with a barbell that are rotational, and you can off-set the loads of barbell to make them more rotationally demanding though)\nBodyweight on it's own often isn't enough because it's a fixed load, once you've adapted to the load you can only do more repetitions (i.e. you can increase endurance but not really strength at that point). Dumbbells will allow you to train closed and open chain movements too.\nDumbbells often let you train with a more natural arc/position\nCons:\n \nBarbells let you lift more (which is more important for lower rep, higher intensity lifting) - especially for the major bilateral lifts (you will generally always be able to bench press, squat and deadlift more with a barbell than dumbbells)\nBarbells are less grip intensive. Dumbbells require more grip strength (which isn't necessarily a bad thing - it just creates a limiting factor if you want to train strength/power more completely)\nBarbells generally allow for better mechanical loading changes with lower body training. i.e. the difference between a back squat (try putting some DB's on your shoulders to see what I mean), a front squat, an overhead squat, and a zercher squat all lead to good training outcomes when used with some variety.\nBarbells allow you to alter grip positions differently by leveraging torque (narrow grip bench vs medium grip or wide grip - can yield different training results you won't be able to get with dumbbells).\nKettlebells provide a better grip challenge than dumbbells and are more suited for exercises like the swing\nKettlebells provide a higher proprioceptive stimulus, particularly for explosive lifts\nBands provide a unique stimulus that is generally hardest where people are their strongest (Dumbbells like Barbells are a more fixed weight relative to the human strength curve)\nSleds allow you to more adequately train concentric only patterns, which can be great for not making you too sore between more dynamic lift days and still getting a training effect.\nI could probably go on. At the end of the day I think having access to a variety of stimulus is ideal, however, you can still get a lot done with dumbbells and bodyweight if that's your only existing option.", "authorship": "human"}

If you take full advantage of this by having two post-workout meals, you can start to see your gains skyrocket.\n \nYou will also find yourself able to train with more intensity.\n \nWhen faced with a full hour's worth of exercise, most of us subconsciously conserve our energy early on, so we don't find ourselves dragging through the latter portion of the workout. By splitting the total day's training between two sessions, intensity levels start and finish higher, which is key to new strength and muscle gains!\n \nAnd since you're fully ramped up for each workout, you'll burn more total calories than if the whole workout had been done at the same time.\n \nThe greater calorie deficit will offset the extra food being eaten, and the overall affect is more muscle with more fat burn\n \nHow To Do Two-A-Day Workouts\n \nTwo-A-Day Basics\n \nSome basic rules apply to all two-a-day programs.\n \nWhile you don't have to be exact with the timing, you need to allow at least six hours between the two workouts. If your workouts are much closer than this, you'll be too tired for optimal performance during round two.\n \nBecause of this, most people find it easiest to hit the gym in the morning before work and then catch another session after work. Going on your lunch break and then again in the evening also works well, as long as you've waited at least six hours.\n \nYou also have to make sure you limit your workouts to no more than 40 minutes in length, excluding the warm-up.\n \nAnd yes, it is very important for you to perform a proper warm-up and cool-down to speed up recovery, since you'll be back in the gym before the day is over!\n \nThe light, rhythmic exercise you get with a proper cool-down, such as 5-10 minutes of an easy aerobic activity like running, will help the heart to return the pooled blood trapped in the pumped-up muscles, speed up the removal of lactic acid and other metabolic byproducts, and allow the muscles to lengthen again after the chronic contractions of a good lifting session.\n \nYou'll quickly get tired of two-a-days if you're constantly fatigued, so a quick and efficient recovery is the key to this program's success.\n \nTwo-A-Days Should Be Cycled\n \nSimply doing two random workouts in one day will quickly lead to overtraining and burnout. There's a proper way to structure your program so that you meet the increased energy demands and take full advantage of this unique fat-burning and muscle-building opportunity.\n \nDue to the intensity of training, these programs are best saved for busting through plateaus, or for those times when you're extremely motivated to work out and the idea of going to the gym that much sounds appealing.\n \nTo avoid overtraining, two-a-days should be cycled—two weeks on, one week off—or you'll burn out and, alas, plateau—the very thing you'd hoped to overcome.\n \nTreat the two-a-day regime with respect, and it will respect you back!\n \nDesigning A Two-A-Day Program\n \nWhile there are plenty of ways to design your program, one of the most effective is lifting heavy in the first workout, then lighter in the second.\n \nThis lets you train your high-threshold muscle fibers—the ones with the most strength and growth potential—with a short, tough workout in the morning, while fitting in an evening workout that's easier but longer.", "authorship": "human"}

Check out Prilepin tables for a rough guide:\nYour rest periods will depend on your training. The heavier you're lifting, the longer rest you need between sets. If you're training in the 1-5 rep range, you may need 4-5 minutes rest between sets. This will decrease as you move to lower rep ranges. If you're training with 9-12 reps, you may only need 30-60 seconds of rest between sets. (Keep in mind this is just a rough guideline)@\nPush yourself to technical failure (not absolute failure). Meaning: once your form stars to deteriorate, you should stop within 1-2 reps. Remember: your body ALWAYS adapts to EXACTLY what you do and continuing to train after technical failure will engrain bad movement patterns. \nDefinitely listen to music! Anything that helps get you in the right head space and contributes to a positive training experience is a huge bonus. Music has powerful psychological effects and it is smart to harness these in training. \nSome recommended books that helped me early in my journey:\nStarting Strength by Mark Rippetoe\n5/3/1 by Jim Wendler\nStretching Scientifically by Thomas Kurz\nHow to Eat, Move, and Be Healthy by Paul Chek", "authorship": "human"}

I was 22, out of the army, unemployed, applied and accepted onto a college course starting in the autumn and was looking forward at a summer of boredom. I’d managed to change my savings to USD with a really favorable rate so I decided to do a road trip before college started as I knew it was a last chance. Now I’d attended a catholic school staffed by nuns from Missouri, so I had a pretty good command of English even it was my 3rd language. So I flew into New York, and after a week or so I decided to take a coach down to Miami with a Greyhound pass.\n \nYeah, young and stupid me, but after the army I wasn’t really that picky on comforts and didn’t want to blow my finances. Somewhere around the Mason-Dixon line the bus which I thought was an express coach changed into more local services, and we’d change a bus every now and then and go east and west and slowly southwards. In the middle of the night we stop and this young white bloke, not much older than I was, got escorted into the bus by two sheriffs and as they politely asked was the seat free seated next to me. Being now wide awake I was a bit puzzled about my new travel companion, and he was about as puzzled about me so we ended up talking through the night, smuggling in a few beers in at the truck stops and smoking in the back under a coat as you did.\n \nNow I was an European and brought up by the nuns as ’colorblind’ so I had never realised how divided the US society actually was along color lines. Where I was from you didn’t have much ethnicities and NYC was such a shock I just rewired my brain and didn’t actually realise *I* was now the minority people would stare at. Also NYC has public transport, so taking a coach… well, again I had not realised USA was a country where having a car is about as a requirement as going out with your pants on. I mean I had read about it but *realising* it was a different thing. I came with just a duffle bag and a few things as clothing was cheap in the US and I was going to update my wardrobe. So I’d bought a spiffy ”cafe racer” leather jacket in NYC… and you can guess where this leads to. A 6”3 lily-white jarhead in a coach looking like… a bad undercover cop? ( I had quite a few people ask me that.) Oh, ex-military, fine ( didn’t elaborate which military)… And some bemused people asking the other ”why are you speaking with *that* ” and ogling me with disdain. At some point and time I realised I was the only white person on the bus… until the midnight stop.\n \nSo, the only two white guys on the bus, heading down to Florida. My new mate had been paroled from prison and put on the bus to get home to the town north of Jacksonville where his family ran a sawmill. His accent was a southern drawl I had some challenges with, but he had more trouble with my accent. \nEven after I dug out my passport he couldn’t fathom I was a ”foreigner” as ”I was white and spoke English”.\n (Thinking of this I can now understand what Americans mean by ”white privilege”, though I don’t think this was anything privileged.) Funny thing then for me was he was this strong as an ox farmer boy and scared shitless of all the other non-white people on the bus (he did use terms that the nuns would have stuffed a bar of soap in my mouth for). I do not know was it my naivety or arrogance or both that I had no such fear, but he basically thought of me as his bodyguard and I was thinking nobody dares give us grief if I go around with this giant. And here we get into that ”southern hospitality” - we were finally changing buses in Jacksonville and I got a genuine offer, not only come visit but basically a job at the sawmill as he’d learned I was unemployed and was just drifting. Being on a tourist visa or some such details weren’t a problem, after all I wasn’t a ”foreigner”…. when he started mentioning his sisters were single my future started sounding a bit too ”Deliverance” so I handed my now silly drunk best buddy over to his dad who fortunately had shown up to collect the prodigal son before the local law took interest in him, and gave my best excuses I couldn’t join them.\n \nI made it down the coast until Ft. Lauderdale where I thought enough is enough and jumped out and found a motel and a well-needed shower. And my learning curve continued but thats a different story.

violence{which mother narrates to me since that time i was a toddler} when we moved to a different county our life was full of struggles for mum had to work as a casual laborer in potato farms and earn not more than 3$ we are a family of 7 boys and six girls though at the time we moved to the later county all the sisters were married and my two brothers and non was well up to support us younger siblings. before i forget my dad had married a second wife and had 8 siblings besides us,4 boys and 4 girls,the second wife was younger than my mum and i think its because of her that dad discriminated us, but unfortunately a year before we vacated she died.i want to clearly state that since the age i came to realize my self i can only recall two different instances when i saw my dad at home { since age 3 to age 6} i too wanna add that i never at one point saw him smiling. and most of the times he came home{ according to mum} he could just quarrel out of nothing solid, he could go to an extent of beating mum. this makes me shed tears when i remember this,ooooh no i love my mum!!\n \nconsequently mum had to look food for five boys [my mum is not educated, she only went up to class 2} and thus cant find such a good job. after she had hustled quite good money {9$} she took the five of us a government primary school and paid the whole amount of 9$ as enrollment fee.school fees had to be paid later with installments. that was the time i joined class one. we were a poor family to an extent that we didn't have good clothes, food but not shelter since we were living in my grandmothers homestead who had died a couple of years ago.\n \ngod is good, when i did my final primary exam i passed well.i received an admission letter from a national school but i couldn't join since there wasn't enough funds to pay my fees {at this age i was bit mature and i could understand what was going on in our family. without any argument mum proposed a local school which was not far from home but i chose a different one which was also a local school but was a bit far from home {8km} which i could walk to and fro everyday. since i couldn't afford bus fair and the school had no bus.the reason why i chose the school was that it was the best day school it that region and i was determined to pass regardless of the circumstance. i went through a sequence of struggles which among them was: the obvious tiresome journey, being sent home for fees and having low esteem due to being looked down upon by some students from well up families among other things including lack of cash to purchase novels, textbooks and such related staffs. i used to borrow books from friends and read them especially when they are not using them, my best subject is chemistry and nobody was beating me in this , i also loved English though it had “owners”. when i sat for my final exams which i really gave my best, i happened to pass the exam { not forgetting my friends who used to lend me books failed!!} i don't take pride in this but there is one thing that has been ringing in my mind ever since “God has a good purpose over my life. i really love god. i normally pray and i can say that god has done it in my life . in our great country we usually receive funds {loan} from the government and i used a small amount to erect a kiosk { small shop} for mum just near the road where we live to at least lighten the burden of hustle. i have a big dream over this family of ours .\n \nright now im writing this from a university library using computer number 31. i want to say that my dad died in 2008 six years after divorce out of brain cancer, a tumor had grown and started protruding towards the ear. m mum is a prayerful woman. i also loved my dad though i rarely had him. though non of my

Depending on my fitness level, exercise could be as simple as taking a short walk to increase my heart rate and blood flow.\n \nI don't need an intense workout such as heavy weightlifting or high-intensity interval training (HIIT).\nHow I exercise depends on my health goals. For example, if I want to lose fat and gain muscle, I will focus on heavy compound movements. In addition, my diet is extremely critical.\n \nTo keep myself motivated, I measure my results. Furthermore, I don't compare myself to others because everyone’s body is different. Every person has his or her unique different genetics, health, and fitness history. The only person I compare to is my former self.\n \nI focus on my progress.\n \nPersistence and consistency are the two key factors for achieving my goals.\n \nBreak Through Your Plateau\n \nAfter reaching a certain fitness level, your body will stagnate because it has adapted to those changes. This is great if your goal is to maintain. But if you want to break through the plateau, your body must experience a higher intensity or resistance.\n \nThis is when progressive overload applies.\n \nTo get stronger and have more muscle for a particular body part, your body must experience a higher amount of resistance.\n \nFor example, if you can lift 125 pounds for your barbell military press for 4 to 6 reps and you want more strength and muscles in your shoulders, you must increase the weights during your workouts. Along with proper macronutrients fueling and rest, you will gain more strength and shoulder definition over time.\nBut the process could take longer if you want to increase muscle and strength while minimizing fat. To do so, you can first bulk to gain fat and muscle. Afterward, you can cut to maintain muscle while losing fat.\n \nHowever, if you're new to weightlifting, you can quickly build muscle while losing fat.\n \nFocus on Exercises which Excite You\n \nIf your goal is to maintain optimal health, then performing enjoyable exercises will be your most desirable and sustainable approach. That's because you're more likely to exercise if you look forward to them. Such options might be a dance class, morning group hike, or a run with your dog.\n \nFor example, one of my personal favorite hobbies is rock-climbing.\nAlthough it's challenging, I look forward to going to the rock-climbing gym because I find it extremely fun and engaging. It's both physically and mentally difficult because I have many ways of finishing the problem.\n \nWorking out with a partner can make your exercise session even more enjoyable, not to also mention accountability - you both don't want to let the other person down. In addition to improving your health, you get to spend quality time with them which further deepends your relationship.\n \nProducing many health benefits, exercise is an excellent way to release endorphins, ...", "authorship": "human"}

I've been sober for 18 years.\n \nAt any rate, I stopped lifting weights for 12 or 14 years – – and got back into it around 66, after some back surgery, and related aches and pains from an increasingly sedentary lifestyle.\n \nI now lift five days a week. it has literally changed my life. I knew I was somewhat overweight, but I have lost over 20 pounds, while putting on at least 8-10 pounds of muscle – – which means I lost close to 30 pounds of fat. It's remarkable how much fat can hide internally (especially in men) in the abdomen!\n \nI watched the clock turn back.\n \nIt's not just that I am stronger and better built – – my skin tone/elasticity is noticeably better, my mood is brighter, my energy level is much greater – – my general sense of well-being and – – \"alive-ness\" — feels like I have returned to my 40s.\n \nThere is more and more evidence that intelligent weightlifting – – consistent, and intense enough to be genuinely challenging – – can not only retard the aging process, but to some degree, reverse it.\n \nThat has certainly been my experience. Of course, my stamina is not what it was 30 years ago, and 45/50 minutes of intense work is my limit, unless I push so hard that I stop looking forward to workouts – – and run the risk of losing focus toward the end – – which is when you inevitably hurt yourself.\n \nSo I do one body part a day — actually, I divide legs up, and do some legwork on three of those days to make it less brutal – – and I continue to make real progress, look forward to my workouts, and I do not in anyway feel I am over-training.\n \nI think every-day is pushing it. But you can definitely do more than three days a week, if you want to — if you do it intelligently, find what works for you (for me, it is weights heavy enough that I am limited to 6–8 reps per set in most cases), and FOCUS INTENTLY ON EVERY REP TO AVOID INJURY.\n \nMy experience is that five days a week is healthy, fun, and productive. And if you stick with it and push yourself just enough – – the results can be nothing short of magical.", "authorship": "human"}

It seems that a lot of universities and people in general are so easily being used ( by media spinning fake news, by other agitators to go an riot,etc) without them realizing why they are “protesting,rioting, beating the snot out of someone with another viewpoint as them”. When you ask them they spout doctrine that have been given to them by media/agitators/etc without actually being skeptic about the whole thing.\n \nWhy do media push x narrative or opt for narrative Y? What do they have to gain? I will not give a recent example but an old one that is easily googled without getting in the swamp of trump/anti trump swamp. During the Northern Ireland problems in the 1970–2000s some journalists and photographers were caught paying Northern Irish kids to throw rocks at police and start trouble. Back then when there were still ethical boards that actually fact checked the news and the reports, you know what they did? They fired those people and gave them a ban ( depending on the severity and the proof).\n \nNow let us apply this to modern day. These “fact checkers and control organs” do not exist anymore or if they do, they are holed out utterly to the point of being obsolete. You have to ask yourself: Why is CNN telling something like this or that? What do they have to gain by saying this? What political spectrum do they have (donated to hillaries campaign) and is it visible in their reporting ( this is an ear deafening yes, like most mainstream media outlets).\n \nNow armed with these answers ask yourself the following: What does protesting mean for me? Do I benefit from it in any way? If i do protest and it turns violent what will i do? IF i get caught rioting or beating someone up who profits from it? ( the last question is always the media that WANTS riots, it is their bread and butter. IF you riot and “kicking buttskies, the media’s ratings goes up which means more income in advertisements/stock prices will go up etc)\n \nSo who benefits from rioting? The media and they use you, the people to do it and they do not pay you a dime ( even if they did i don’t think a lot of sane people will accept the money or even riot at all). Thus those average joes and janes are reduced to 21st century slaves that listen to the elite mainstream media overlords clacking of the whip.\n \nOf course this isn’t exclusive to the US but the last months it seems that the US is so susceptible to this behavior. Arm yourselves against it by thinking for yourselves, be skeptical about what news says ( be it left, right,etc do your own research if you want to find out the truth). If someone tells you “this is the truth and if you think otherwise you are *insert a curse word or whatever” you know you are dealing with propaganda especially when they do not state facts to back up their claims.\n \nThanks for bearing with me on this rather lengthy piece :)", "authorship": "human"}

In those days these robotic figures were nowhere near as common as today, but it was obvious that its movement, though clever, was controlled by some guy hiding behind a screen, moving the beast according to what was happening.\n \nThe two keepers gave us their spiel about how “Gladys” (or whatever her name was, I forget now) was three years old, very tame and so on, inviting kids to stroke its nose (at which it “purred”).

Cardio exercises are important for heart and lungs , which you can’t skip. 20 high Jumps , Running , jogging is preferred.\nStretches : I strongly recommend having emphasis on maximum body stretches, it’ll increase your functionality in upcoming exercises.\nPush Ups : Keep your hands at same distance as broad as your shoulder width for starters , at least 20 push ups recommended but don't be disappointed if you can’t . It isn't because you are weak it is because you are not in practice.Also Push Ups with less distance between your hands = Good for triceps and shoulders , Push Ups with more gap between your hands = Good for chest . Including 2–3 types of Push Ups recommended.\nPull Ups : Have a bar and do as much pull ups exercise as you can , and if you can’t just try again and again . You will increase repetations eventually with time .\nWeight exercises : If you have weights, biceps curls and shoulder press exercises are adviced . Weight training is important part of workout routine but it optional in the start and you can include it in your routine in future.\nImportant Tips :\nDon’t include too much exercises in the start. More than one exercise for single body part won't make that muscle making process shorter but will exhaust your energy and time.\nStart from your efficiency with less exercises in beginning and increase repetitions and exercises with time.\nDon't think about the result , Trust the process!!!. Enjoy workout routine and only include exercise that you like. (For beginners) . (We don't want our body to get tired early of the routine.)\nYou don't need protein powder or any extra supplement apart from the daily food you get. Just eat much you want but there should be 4–5 hours at least gap between workout time and food time. Eat any junk food much you want but remember once in a month, don't eat on regular basis . It makes you lazy .\nMost important thing is “Rest”. Do take 8 hours sleep at least . Do Workout 4 days a week . Remember your don't get muscle in workout time but it builds muscle when you sleeping.\nStart today, be consistent.

If you exercise late in the night and don't follow that with food, then that highly beneficial period is likely to be wasted.\n \nThat being said, if you can't consistently exercise in the morning, then evening exercise is a good way to go.

While it is difficult to pinpoint a single person as the “most ignorant” American I have ever met, I can recount an interesting encounter that shed light on the importance of education and open-mindedness.\nA few years ago, I had the opportunity to engage in a conversation with an individual during a social gathering. Let’s call him John. John was a middle-aged man who held strong opinions about various topics, particularly politics and world affairs. As our conversation progressed, it became evident that John had limited exposure to diverse viewpoints and relied heavily on sensationalized media sources for information.\n \nOne topic that stood out during our discussion was climate change. John firmly believed that climate change was a hoax, dismissing the overwhelming scientific consensus and evidence supporting its existence. His arguments were based on misconceptions and misinformation propagated by climate change skeptics. Despite attempts to present factual data and studies, John remained resistant to accepting any alternative perspective.\n \nWhat struck me about this encounter was not just John’s skepticism but his unwillingness to critically evaluate new information. It highlighted the importance of intellectual curiosity and the ability to challenge one’s own beliefs. In a rapidly changing world where information is easily accessible, it is crucial to remain open-minded and consider multiple perspectives.\n \nIgnorance, in this context, can be seen as the lack of exposure to accurate and reliable information. ignorance is not necessarily a permanent state but rather a condition that can be overcome through education and a willingness to learn. Encountering individuals like John serves as a reminder of the significance of promoting critical thinking and fostering a culture of lifelong learning.\n \nWhile John may have exemplified ignorance on the topic of climate change, it is essential to approach such encounters with empathy and understanding. Instead of labeling someone as the “most ignorant,” it is more constructive to recognize the gaps in knowledge and engage in meaningful conversations that encourage learning and growth.", "authorship": "human"}

Once, while watching a talk show on another network, a soap opera star, whose name I don’t remember, mentioned that he was from a particular city in Scotland that is located in what is called “The Highlands”. I said, “Ooh, he’s a Highlander,” to which my ex responded, “So he’s immortal?”\n \nShe was not joking.\n \nShe repeatedly used words such as “a-scared”, “muchly”, “irregardless”, and a host of others.\n \nAfter three years of marriage, I could no longer stand to even look at her. Just being in her presence seemed to suck IQ points away. It was very hard for me to hold a meaningful conversation with her, which made the whole marriage seem oppressive to me. Strangely enough, none of her siblings had the same problem. Both of her parents were fairly intelligent, with her mother possibly having a very above average IQ.\n \nAhhhh, that felt good to get out.", "authorship": "human"}

Most Americans only know what they want to know, or what we are told through biased media. “Iran is evil, and is part of ISIS” or “Turkey is not a country it is food” or “Only good middle east country is Israel.” This one is one of my favorites because it comes from two places, the religious community (In my opinion the most hard headed and ignorant group in this country) believes Israel is a chosen people of God because of the Bible, and the money men in the country put this out so the Jewish Americans will stay happy and bring more fiscal interests.\n \nIn short many Americans don’t try to gain knowledge, most of there knowledge is simply to reinforce already held bias and prejudices.

A certain degree of soreness in the muscles is inevitable when we move in ways that we’re not used to, but it shouldn’t be crippling (that means you’ve overdone it). But any other kind of pain, especially in your joints, or any of the other things I mentioned, are red flags\nThat said, here are some more specific suggestions.\nMake sure your routine has a strength component. Do this 2–3 times a week, on non-consecutive days.\nMake sure your routine has an endurance component. Do this 3–5 times a week.\nMake sure you keep your joints mobile. Do this almost everyday; think of it like ‘brushing your teeth’, but for your joints.\nSTRENGTH\n \nFor each of the categories below, pick an exercise which is moderately challenging (not too hard and not too easy). Accumulate 15 - 30 total repetitions per session for each category. Split them up any way you like. If you feel like the exercise in a particular category goes from ‘moderately challenging’ to ‘easy’, pick a harder version of the exercise, go back down to the lower end of that repetition range, and build your way up to the higher end. Then rinse and repeat. Be patient and do this over months, not days. That’s how you stay safe. Sometimes, to make an exercise harder, you’ll need to add more weight. Be creative and use household objects.\nPushing (push up variations)\nPulling (dead hang, pull up variations, rowing variations)\nSquatting (squat/lunge etc)\nENDURANCE\n \nPick an activity you enjoy (e.g. walking/hiking/running/swimming/cycling/dancing etc) - it doesn’t matter what you pick. You can switch it up session to session, or not, as you like - it doesn’t matter. Do it steadily for 20–30 minutes. Do it at a difficulty level where you can speak 5–6 words at a time before needing to take a breath (but if you can speak 15–20 words, you need to step it up).\n \nOnce you’re used to the activity, increase the duration of one session a week to 45 minutes, while the other sessions remain 20–30 minutes. Eventually increase the long session close to 60 minutes.\n \nJOINT MOBILITY\n \nLook at every joint in your body - neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, spine, hips, knees and ankles. Each of them can move in certain ways. Some joints, such as the neck, spine, hips, and shoulders, can move more freely than the others. Throughout the day, take little breaks of a minute or two, and keep moving the joints in all the ways they CAN move. Keep it super easy, but do it a bunch of times. Don’t sweat if you can’t move EVERY joint EVERY day, just make sure no joint gets ignored for too long. Easy-peasy.\n \nHope you find this helpful. It looks simple, but the power is in DOING, not in KNOWING. If you’re a beginner and you keep this up for a few months, your health, energy, and overall sense of well-being are bound to improve.

Here is why I think it helps:\n \nWorkout in the mornings:\n \nIf you’re on the fence about starting a morning workout routine, consider the following benefits.\nFewer distractions.\nMorning workouts typically mean you’re less prone to distractions. When you first wake up, you haven’t started tackling the day’s \nto-do list\n. You’re also less likely to get phone calls, text messages, and emails.\n \nWith fewer distractions, you’re more likely to follow through with your workout.\nBeat the heat.\nIn the summer, working out in the morning will feel more comfortable, as the hottest part of the day is 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. It’s recommended to avoid outdoor exercise during this time.\n \nIf you prefer outdoor activities, it’s best to work out in the early morning, especially on very hot days.\nIncreased alertness.\nA morning workout may be a better match for your body’s hormonal fluctuations.\n \nCortisol is a hormone that keeps you awake and alert. It’s often called the stress hormone, but it only causes problems when there’s too much or too little of it.\n \nTypically, cortisol increases in the early morning hours and drops in the evening. It reaches its peak around 8 a.m. If you have a healthy circadian rhythm, your body might be more primed to exercise at this time.\nBetter focus.\nPhysical activity also improves \nfocus and concentration\n, regardless of when you do it. But if you have trouble focusing during the day, a morning workout might be just the ticket.\n \nA 2019 study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that morning exercise improves attention, visual learning, and decision-making.\n \nIn the study, participants completed a round of 8-hour days of prolonged sitting with and without a 30-minute morning walk on the treadmill. On some days, they also took 3-minute walking breaks every 30 minutes.\n \nThe days with morning exercise were associated with better cognition throughout the day, especially when paired with regular breaks.\n \nIf a morning workout does not fit into your schedule, make it a point to move actively in the evening!\n \nA well-structured 45-minute fitness routine done four times a day is more than enough to help you seek its benefits.", "authorship": "human"}

I would have added in that the Southern Baptist Convention is the nation’s largest Protestant denomination (even though half of them never show up for church) and it split with mainline Baptists in the 1800s because they wanted missionaries to be able to own slaves. They openly say this in their seminaries when men interested in becoming pastors (it’s never a woman) study the history of the denomination—which I can respect them for admitting. But these are the people who want to determine how teachers address slavery.

Here’s a breakdown of both approaches:\n \nFull-Body Workouts (2-3 Times a Week)\n \nPros:\n- \nTime Efficient:\n You can achieve significant results with fewer sessions per week.\n- \nIncreased Frequency:\n Each muscle group is worked multiple times a week, which can enhance muscle growth and strength.\n- \nFlexibility:\n Easier to schedule and can accommodate busy weeks without losing progress.\n- \nCaloric Burn:\n Engaging multiple muscle groups can lead to a higher calorie burn per session.\n \nCons:\n- \nIntensity Management:\n It can be challenging to perform high-intensity workouts for all muscle groups in one session.\n- \nRecovery Needs:\n May require longer recovery time between sessions, especially if workouts are intense.\n \nSplit Routines (5-6 Days a Week)\n \nPros:\n- \nFocused Workouts:\n Allows for higher volume and intensity per muscle group, which can be beneficial for hypertrophy (muscle growth).\n- \nRecovery:\n Muscle groups get more recovery time between workouts, potentially reducing fatigue.\n- \nVariety:\n More exercise variations and techniques can be incorporated.\n \nCons:\n- \nTime Commitment:\n Requires more days in the gym, which may not be feasible for everyone.\n- \nRisk of Imbalance:\n If a session is missed, it might lead to uneven training of muscle groups.\n \nGetting the Best Results with Least Time Invested\nPrioritize Compound Movements:\n Focus on exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once (e.g., squats, deadlifts, bench presses, pull-ups). This maximizes efficiency.\nHigh-Intensity Training:\n Incorporate techniques like supersets, circuit training, or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to increase the intensity and calorie burn within a shorter time frame.\nProgressive Overload:\n Ensure you are gradually increasing the weight or resistance in your workouts to continue making progress.\nConsistency:\n Stick to a regular workout schedule, whether it’s full-body or split, to maintain progress.\nNutrition and Recovery:\n Pay attention to your diet and recovery strategies, as they are crucial for maximizing results. Ensure adequate protein intake and consider active recovery strategies.\nListen to Your Body:\n Adjust your training volume and intensity based on how your body responds to avoid burnout or injury.\nConclusion\n \nBoth full-body workouts and split routines can be effective, but for minimal time investment, full-body workouts (2-3 times a week) are generally more efficient for most people. However, if you prefer or can commit to a split routine and it fits your goals better, it can also yield excellent results. Ultimately, choose the method that you enjoy and can stick with consistently.", "authorship": "human"}

He is a totally undeserved blessing that is beyond my comprehension as to why I was gifted with him.\n \nOffspring are blessings, so that is one important, non-monetary measurement.\n \nFurther, I received the “\"gift of faith” in Christ, as a child, and I am persisting in my very flawed and unremarkable pursuit of as much of what I know He wants me to be, have and do as I know how to and that I have the willingness to cooperate with him to pursue.\n \nAnother important yardstick.\n \nThird, I have reasonably good health and was given strength in the physical part of life, though the strong appetites that often accompany generally good health I have exploited to my disadvantage.\n \nNow, by the world’s standards, I have clean-enough water to bathe in; I buy distilled water to drink and cook with; I have 650 square feet with a roof over it all, and doors that have yet to be breached, despite the higher incidence of crime where I live; I have “\"stuff,” like an old smart phone, a 32″ tv, an old laptop, some worn out clothes.\n \nPretty rich, as compared to literally 4/5ths or more of the world’s population.

And who don’t by any means have “all” their basic needs met because that would crowd out the pleasant self-satisfaction that the richer enjoy on a daily basis, as they get hair cuts and dental work and dinners out that the “poor” cannot afford to count on to lift their spirits or buoy their resolve for tomorrow’s demands.\n \nProverbs 29:2 in the bible says: “When the righteous rule, the people rejoice; but when the wicked are on top, the people mourn.” I think the number of people who are mourning in America is getting larger and has been doing so for about 45 years.\n \nIf you live in the US, the next time you see a stranger ask yourself ‘How can I tell for sure when the last time was that that person had a good meal?’\n \nFOOTNOTE: In the Colorado county where I live (El Paso), and where the headquarters of Focus on the Family, and Compassion International, and International Bible Study, and The Navigators, are located, all world- renown Christian organizations, one-third of all school aged children go to bed hungry every night.\n \nAre they as hungry as Mali’s 7.5 million kids under 15 years of age who are often left with no option other than to turn tricks for the ones with money so they can keep “earning” their right to stay at the mosque where the local imams bring one child of every household to serve Allah?\n \nProbably not.\n \nBut can a country who doesn't feed it's own children anymore qualify as a leader of the free world?

Depending on my fitness level, exercise could be as simple as taking a short walk to increase my heart rate and blood flow.\n \nI don't need an intense workout such as heavy weightlifting or high-intensity interval training (HIIT).\nHow I exercise depends on my health goals. For example, if I want to lose fat and gain muscle, I will focus on heavy compound movements. In addition, my diet is extremely critical.\n \nTo keep myself motivated, I measure my results. Furthermore, I don't compare myself to others because everyone’s body is different. Every person has his or her unique different genetics, health, and fitness history. The only person I compare to is my former self.\n \nI focus on my progress.\n \nPersistence and consistency are the two key factors for achieving my goals.\n \nBreak Through Your Plateau\n \nAfter reaching a certain fitness level, your body will stagnate because it has adapted to those changes. This is great if your goal is to maintain. But if you want to break through the plateau, your body must experience a higher intensity or resistance.\n \nThis is when progressive overload applies.\n \nTo get stronger and have more muscle for a particular body part, your body must experience a higher amount of resistance.\n \nFor example, if you can lift 125 pounds for your barbell military press for 4 to 6 reps and you want more strength and muscles in your shoulders, you must increase the weights during your workouts. Along with proper macronutrients fueling and rest, you will gain more strength and shoulder definition over time.\nBut the process could take longer if you want to increase muscle and strength while minimizing fat. To do so, you can first bulk to gain fat and muscle. Afterward, you can cut to maintain muscle while losing fat.\n \nHowever, if you're new to weightlifting, you can quickly build muscle while losing fat.\n \nFocus on Exercises which Excite You\n \nIf your goal is to maintain optimal health, then performing enjoyable exercises will be your most desirable and sustainable approach. That's because you're more likely to exercise if you look forward to them. Such options might be a dance class, morning group hike, or a run with your dog.\n \nFor example, one of my personal favorite hobbies is rock-climbing.\nAlthough it's challenging, I look forward to going to the rock-climbing gym because I find it extremely fun and engaging. It's both physically and mentally difficult because I have many ways of finishing the problem.\n \nWorking out with a partner can make your exercise session even more enjoyable, not to also mention accountability - you both don't want to let the other person down.

Based on my own experience and some literature and books I read I have tried to sum up the basics of these components below.\n \n1)\n \nStrength Training\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters :- \nFirst let us understand what it is not. It is often misunderstood as bulking up and building 6-packs ab and Salman like biceps for show-off. So most people feel that they don’t really need it. WRONG!\n \nIt is actually defined as a type of anaerobic physical exercise that by the use of resistance specializes in\n \n>\nIncreasing Muscular Fitness (Increases muscle strength, muscle mass and size)\n \n>Increasing Bone Strength and bone density\n \n>Increasing Tendon and Ligament Strength\n \n>Improving Joint Function\n \nApart from these benefits in aids in health improvement ,increases metabolism, aids in fat loss, overall fitness levels ,improved lipid profile (improves the good cholesterol) etc.\n \nHence it is absolutely critical component.\n \nHow you can do It :- \nOne has following options to do it.\n \na)\n \nAt Gym using various equipments\n :- You can perform it at GYM. All you need to make sure is that you need to have a good sensible trainer.\n \nYou may do it 2-3 times/week for an hour each.\n \nb)\n \nAt Home using Resistance band\n :- This is another option that you may perform at your home. You may order the band online (Cosco is a good brand),some good videos (10 min-30 min) are available online to learn and do the exercises along with the video. Convenience is better in this option but the drawback is that you won’t have good control on the exact amount of resistance. But it can be done on days when you look for some light strength sessions.\n \nc)\n \nAt Home using Body weight\n :- The 5 basic strength exercises – Push Up ,Pull Up, Dips, Sit-ups and Squats are key to overall strength. Rather than working on isolated muscles they work on large muscle groups. You may do these in conjunction with band/dumbbells or standalone also. You can also do exercises like Lunges, Mountain Climbers, bridges etc.\n \nd)\n \nAt Home using dumbbells \n:- If you know the basics right you may perform the entire exercises that you do on equipments in a Gym at your home only. You can do good variations with just a set of \n2 and 5 kgs of dumbbells\n using proper form and by doing the moves slowly. This can be started at any age by using a set of 2 Kg dumbbells and is often a most neglected part.\n \nDon’t forget to warm up before starting the strength training sessions. You may like to wind up with a 5 min stretching session.\n \n2)\n \nCardio Exercises\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters \n:- Cardio is any form of exercise/activity that is designed to work the cardiovascular system that raises your heart rate and breathing and consequently an increase in the circulation of blood and oxygen throughout the body for an extended period of time. Getting your body to sweat also helps you to release toxins that would otherwise build up in your tissues. The benefits range from weight loss, improved Heart health, improved Lung health, improved stamina, improved immunity, stabilized blood pressure,increased energy levels,more active and dynamic lifestyle, reduced mood swings etc.\n \nHow you can do it :- \nYou may\n \nenjoy any of the below/club them/etc. to get the benefits. Go for a variety rather than repeating the same all the time.\n \na)\n \nFast Walking/Light Jogging :- \nJust go to a park nearby and enjoy fresh unpolluted morning air, get some sunlight and do fast walk/light jog to start the day.\n \nb)\n \nTreadmill /Elliptical machine/stationary cycling \n:- Good for those rainy seasons\n \nc)\n \nCycling \n:- You may incorporate use of a bicycle to go to nearby places etc. or do it as a part of exercise weekly.\n \nd)\n \nSwimming \n:- One of the best cardio exercises. Just use googles and caps to avid the chlorine side effects.\n \ne)\n \nAerobic Dance Workouts \n:- In Youtube you have some good videos that you may see and do along.\n \nf)\n \nP-T exercises \n:- Remember the school days. Those exercises can still be incorporated.\n \ng)\n \nStair climbing \n:- Avoid lifts and take stairs.\n \nh)\n \nRope Jumping\n :- Good if you enjoy it.\n \n3)\n \nFlexibility Exercises\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters \n:- Flexibility may be defined as the ability of our joints and body parts to execute their full range of motion. Flexibility deteriorates rapidly with a sedentary lifestyle and without adequate flexibility you are more prone to injuries and with tight muscles daily activities become difficult to perform. We create body movement and posture habits which tend to reduce joint mobility. The benefits of flexibility exercises are less back pain, increased range of motion, injury prevention ,improved circulation, less stress, better posture and confidence. A flexible body a flexible spine ultimately leads to a flexible mind which is more adaptive . Practicing Yogaasanas daily is the most perfect and easiest way to obtain a flexible body and a clear mind It would help one to tone the muscles, skeletal system, nourish the body tissues and burn fat. It is excellent for all internal organs and various yoga asanas target specific parts and organs of the body like vertebra, Joints, neck, shoulder, heart, lungs, kidney etc. It will also improve your balance both physical and emotional.\n \nHow you can do it \n:- As I have already written above that YOGAASANAS are the most perfect way to flexibility.. You don’t have to do complicated postures at all , just simple basic stretching asanas have to be done with awareness of breath. You really have to be at ease during each posture and you shouldn’t feel any pain. One very good 22 minute video is that of a sequence called “Padmasadhna” which consists of 12 yogaasanas, it is taught in Art of living advance course but can be easily practiced by anyone. You may also learn asanas from any yoga instructor near your place, but you can learn simple asanas yourselves with videos.One video called Shilpa Yoga is also very well designed. Below are some common asanas which you can simply google :-\n \na)\n \nLying Asanas\n:-Ardha Halasana,Sethu Bandhasana,Naukasana,Makarasana,Shalabhasana,Bhujangasana,Dhanurasana,Kativakraasana and shavasana\n \nb)\n \nSitting Asanas\n \n:- Vrajrasana,Parvatasana,Shashankasana,Marjariasana,Vyaghrasana,Janu Shirshasana,Gomukhasana,Padmasana,Budhkonasana and Adho Mukh Shvanasana\n \nc)\n \nStanding Asanas\n:-Tadasana,Prishtasana,Padhastasana,Vriksasana,Natrajasana,Utkatasana,Trikonasana,Veer Bhradraasana,Konasana and Kati chakrasana.\n \n4)\n \nBreathing Exercises\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters :- \nBreathing exercises are basically an activity that would involve taking breaths consciously. Every emotion has an impact on our breath eg when we are happy and relaxed we breathe deeply, when we are in anger we automatically take short breaths etc. Now our motive is to control these emotions/feelings but we often find ourselves not able to keep them under control. The best way to achieve this is through control of breath ,when we do breathing exercises and learn conscious breathing we are able to control our emotions as well, it’s like a remote control to our emotions. If we observe ourselves there are two type of actions a) Voluntary b) Involuntary. Voluntary actions are the ones that we do consciously like talking, walking, moving our hands, eating drinking etc. .Involuntary actions are the actions that are taken care of by the conscious energy that resides within us like conversion of oxygen to carbon dioxide by our cells, digestion of food, pumping of blood by our heart ,all cellular actions etc. The thing with breath is that when we are not aware of it, it is involuntary but when we become aware of it and start breathing with awareness it becomes voluntary and we can control it. Hence it is a transit between Voluntary to Involuntary, Known to Unknowable, manifested to Unmanifested it is a jump into the divine. Hence breathing exercises or pranayama have found an unique place in our Vedas, yoga pradipikas, yoga sutras and more recently in Medical Science as well .\n \nOur lung function is obviously improved and more quantity of oxygen reaches and nourishes every single cell that restores health, youthfulness and cheerfulness.\n \nHow you can do it :- T\nhey may be classified as the nature of breaths we take\n \na) slow/deep/long breaths eg Anulom Vilom & Nadi Shodhan (Alternate Nostril Breathing), Deep Ujvai Breaths,3- Stage Pranayama, Simple Deep Breathing, Abdominal Breathing\n \nb) short/rapid/quick blasts of breaths eg. Kappal Bhatti,\n \nc) cyclic rhythm including a blend of both eg\n. \nSudarshan Kriya\n \nas taught in the Art of Living\n \n5)\n \nMeditation\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters :- \nMeditation is actually “Doing Nothing”. You just sit with eyes closed and just as a witness observe your own thoughts without judging without comparing without imagining, without labeling. It gives us deep rest, far deeper than what sleep offers you. Meditation makes you more Dynamic, more lively, more focused, improves your concentration, improves your happiness quotient, highly raises your healing power. Other benefits are\n \n>Keeps you stress free\n \n>Reduces aging\n \n>Helps you to appreciate life more\n \n>Helps you feel more connected\n \n>Improves Brain Function\n \n>Helps you give good sleep\n \n>Increases Immunity\n \n>Increases your awareness and attention\n \n>You gain control over your mind\n \nIn this 10 minutes you would realise that how our mind exaggerates and magnifies small problems in life and that you have immense potential to face all challenges of life. The most important realization that occurs is that actually \nno incidence or no person or no situation is joyous or sorrowful, it is actually the “SELF-TALK” that we do with ourselves is the source of joy/misery\n. After that even when situations come which tend to make you tensed/stressed by positive self-talk you increase the power of the self and don’t let the negative talks of mind over power you.\n \nWe develop love and compassion with others and let go of our habit of Criticizing, complaining and comparing.\n \nHow you can do it :- \nMeditation should be practiced daily for around 10 minutes. Some guided meditations are available online. You just need to listen to it and let go. You don’t have to do anything, just listen and relax. Initially guided meditations are beneficial, slowly once you get the basics you may not actually need them. You can simple sit and meditate. Just remember that it is not concentration, it is de-concentration.\n \nWe just have to make a schedule for ourself and then stick to it remembering that \n“ Self Discipline” is the only thing that makes someone miserable/blissfull,healthy/unhealthy,strong/week\n.\n \n6)\n \nA Balanced Diet\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters :- \nJust remember the basic fact that “You are what you eat”. You would need to get all your macronutrients (carbohydrate, Protein ,fat and water) and all your micronutrients (Vit A, Vit B Complex (B1,B2,B3,B5,B6,B7,B9 and B12),Vit C, Vit D, Vit E,Vit K,calcium,magnesium,iron,zinc,selenium,phosphorous etc ) in order to allow your body to function optimally. I would advise just spend an hour on internet and surf about these nutrients.\n \nHow you can do it :- \nFirst let us discuss about some basic points related to diet :-\n \na)\n \nMindful eating and chewing each bite till it turns liquid\n \n: - Eat mindfully with thankfulness and chew each bite at least 64 times that enhances digestion and nutrient absorption.\n \nb)\n \nAvoid\n all \nFried Products\n (Samosa, Vada, Pakoda, Papad etc.), All \nMaida\n products-Bread , Paw , Naan , Tandoori Roti made of Maida , Bakery Products , Maggi ,Noodles etc., All \nPacket\n Food- Farsana , Mixtures , Chips , Kurkure, Ready to eat products , etc., All \nFast \nFood- Pizza , Burger ,sauces, Junk Food , Hotel Food ,KFC, Mc Donald’s, Chinese Food etc., All \nFatty\n Food-Butter , Cream , Peanut Butter, Nutrilite , Mayonnaise etc\n \nAnd especially for phenytoin you have to stay away from all sodas and cold drinks also.\n \nc)\n \nRefined White Sugar\n :- This is the most dangerous food item on our shelves .It is rightly termed as “White Poison” by nutrition experts. Completely eliminate the use of refined white sugar. Date Syrup, Honey and Jaggery are better alternatives as they contain important nutrients , although they should also be consumed within limits as they have high Glycemic Index. Avoid All \nsugar\n Products- Sweets, Cold Drinks ,Chocolates ,Biscuits, Ice-creams, Pastries, Cakes, Tea, Coffee etc.\n \nd)\n \nFruits\n :- Include seasonal fruits a part of your daily food list. Definitely include Guava or peru (for highest Vitamin C), Awla (for highest antioxidants) , Carrot ( for highest vitamin A) daily. Additionally have fruits like pomengranate ,oranges,papaya,banana,apple etc. You should aim for 2-3 servings/day\n \ne)\n \nGrains\n :- Go for variety,don’t restrict you to just one.Ideally try to have one grain only once per day .Have wheat,brown rice,white rice,wheat,ragi,jowar,bajra,Makai.\n \nf)\n \nPulses and Legumes \n:- Select from wide variety of Moong,masoor,arhar dals etc and beans like kidney beans soya beans,chick peas etc as they are high in protein content.\n \ng)\n \nOmega 3 Fatty Acids\n :- Extremely critical to be included in the diet on daily basis. Flaxseeds, Walnuts , Fish and cod liver oil are good sources.You may occasionaly use a cod liver oil supplement\n \nh)\n \nAcid-Alkaline balance\n :- Almost all cooked food tend to have an acidic effect on the body. Try to include raw fruits and vegetables daily to restore the balance.\n \ni)\n \nSeeds and Nuts\n :- Include them daily in your diet plan. Remember to soak the nuts (including peanut ) as un soaked nuts have very high amount of phylates that interfere in Iron absorption.\n \nNuts – Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Dates, Raisins,\n \nSeeds – Flaxseeds, Sesame seeds(in winter) , Sunflower seeds, Chia seeds, Basil seeds , Pumpkin seeds.\n \nInclude some roasted gram (Chana), Sattu drink and handful of Sprouts in your daily diet plan.\n \nj)\n \nCooking Oil\n :- never use a single cooking oil all the time. Use a blend of cooking oils, have one for breakfast, another for lunch and another for dinner. Aim for varieties of which one is high in MUFA, one high in PUFA and one which has both in balance .Just see the labels of the cooking oil. Use olive oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, mustard oil ,groundnut oil, safflower oil, rice bran oil, coconut oil etc. and keep shuffling between them. The daily intake should be restricted. Ghee could also be used wisely in some quantity. The important thing to remember is that never eat FRIED foods and cook vegetables in less quantity of oil .\n \nk)\n \nAyurvedic Herbs \n:- Use herbs in medicinal form occasionally to boost immunity. Eg Tulsi, Neem, Triphala, Ashwagandha, Guduchhi etc.\n \nl)\n \nVeg Vs Nonveg \n:- Its totally a personal choice. Whilst Non Veg food are rich sources of nutrients like protein and iron they do have an array of drawbacks. One has to decide for himself. I benefitted hugely by switching to being vegetarian from part 3-4 years.\n \nNeedless to mention in the above list that Alcoholic Products, Cigarettes, Tobacco etc. are a Big NO! Remember that our body is the temple where God resides in the form of our soul/consciousness/energy whatever we may like to call it. We are all divine beings and this body is a precious miraculous gift from divinity to us, we should never disrespect it by the intake of such products. “We are not human beings on a spiritual journey , we are spiritual beings on a human journey” hence the best way to show gratitude to divinity is by taking care of your body!\n \nThe above components if integrated properly would surely raise the self-healing abilities of your body. Just have faith that there is a cosmic intelligence that has fine-tuned the entire universe eg. mass of electron, gravitational constant, electromagnetic constant, distance between earth and sun, composition of air that we breathe and millions of such parameters had to be exactly the same as they are for you and me to exist. Within our cells lies the same intelligence that is driving billions of galaxies. Each cell has the same intelligence by which it is able to perform such complicated functions with such an ease. Each cell in the body is like an universe in itself. This intelligence is working all the time within you and can definitely re fine tune the parameters of your body that have gone out of order. Just set your priorities right and you can surely manage one hour/day ,let these things be an integral part of your life like you brush your teeth, you bath these also shall be included in your daily routine.\n \nHope this helps,\n \nI belong to you! Thanks.", "authorship": "human"}

Switching from a gym to a workout routine from home takes a little getting used to but it certainly isn’t impossible.\n \nFirst, be kind to yourself this is a big change. With big changes come adjustment periods. In this guide to creating your perfect home workout routine we’ll cover:\n \nWays to start working out from home\n \nHow to use your home as a gym\n \nFree resources for creating a workout from home routine\n \nBudget-friendly tips for creating a home gym\n \n2. Set a Schedule\n \nFirst, create your weekly schedule. This is so important for carving out time for fitness. Aim to schedule at least 40 minutes a day for your workout from home routine. You can cut it up into 15-minute intervals. Take one day off a week or alternate your workout between an at-home stretching routine and a daily at-home fitness routine.\n \nOne tip to sticking with your at-home workout routine is to prepare for it just like you would if you’re headed to a gym. Put your workout clothes shoes and water bottle all right next to your home office space. Consider even wearing your workout clothes while you work. That way you’ll have fewer excuses to carve out the time for an at-home workout.\n3. The Best Free Resources for Working Out from Home\n \nRight now there are countless free workout routines available for you to stream from anywhere. Check with your regular gym, or use my free YouTube videos. If you are hypermobile, check out our Spoonie Resources page too for links to many Hypermobility specialists.\n \n4. Create Your Own Workout\n \nTake some time to engage your mind and get creative with your workout from home routine. Create your own workout routine with these easy steps:\n \nPick 9 exercises in a row that use equipment you have in your home. If you don’t have any equipment, pick bodyweight exercises.\n \nPick an exercise for your upper body core and lower body. Three of each works nicely\n \nDo 8 to 12 reps of each and move on to the next one with just a 10-second break. Work your way through the list 3 to 5 times.\n \nRepeat 3 times a week.\n \n5. Go for a Daily Walk or Jog\n \nGetting outside is extremely important while you’re limited to leaving your house. Find time to go for a daily walk or jog. If you’re walking, bring 1 to 2-pound hand weights with you avoid using ankle weights, which cause unnecessary strain on your knees and hips. Do speed intervals by speed walking or lightly jogging for one minute then at a normal pace for 2 to 3 minutes.\n \nIf you’re a jogger do the same thing, except don’t choke the weights. Hold them as loosely as possible in your hand.\n6. Get Creative\n \nKeep your workouts fresh by switching up your routine. Change your walking route mix and match exercises and use an app once a week. Find a unique blend of different exercises that works for you. Don’t be afraid to experiment a little bit here. Try working out during different times of the day or opt to try a new way of exercising. Take advantage of the freedom you have to set your schedule from home and make the most out of a less-than-ideal situation.\n \n7. Go for HSD/EDS Safe Exercise Apps\n \nRight now there are a lot of fitness apps that are offering at-home workout routines for free. But most of these are not safe for hypermobile persons. These apps are specifically designed to have safer exercises for persons with unstable bodies. A few of my favorites are:\n \nThe Zebra Club - by Jeanie Di Bon\n \nPhysioEd\n8. Split Everything into Small Breaks\n \nIf you're juggling kids at home a spouse who’s got a lot of conference calls and a million tasks piling up with your work and life we hear you. Seriously. This is A LOT to take on at the moment and exercising at home might be the last thing on your mind especially when you’re low on spoons. There are certainly ways to carve out time for a workout from home routine.\n \nInstead of trying to get a 30-minute block in, split it up into smaller intervals. Do a work task and then take 3 minutes for a single exercise. If you use this method, use a low-load with little to no extra weight. Without being warmed up it’s unsafe to add weights to your exercise.\n \n9. Take Your At-Home Workout Outdoors\n \nOne way to make your workout from home routine successful is to move your workout outdoors. If you have an outdoor space set up your laptop or phone outdoors for a workout full of Vitamin D. This is a great way to not only work out from home but boost your immunity too. Sunshine boosts your mood and the fresh air is good for your soul. Not to mention that Vitamin D3 is vital for a healthy immune system.", "authorship": "human"}

Once the muscle fibers are repaired they increase in size\n \nThis is muscle hypertrophy.\n \nHow does it work?\n \nMuscle growth occurs whenever the rate of muscle protein synthesis(MPS) is greater than the rate of muscle protein breakdown. Both, the synthesis and breakdown of proteins are controlled by complimentary cellular mechanisms. Resistance exercise can profoundly stimulate muscle cell hypertrophy and the resultant gain in strength. However, the time course for this hypertrophy is relatively slow, generally taking several weeks or months to be apparent\n[1]\n \nIt is generally agreed that resistance exercise results in increased MPS in the postexercise recovery period . Indeed, an acute bout of resistance exercise can increase the rate of MPS about two- to fivefold after exercise, and this effect can persist for up to 48 h in fed subjects \n[2]\n \nSo given we can only be in one state at a time, muscle building will only start once you are done working out and you are in your recovery phase.\n \nMuscle building does not mean just taking a day off from the gym.\n \nYou also need to pay special attention to these for hypertrophy\nCaloric surplus diet with sufficient protein\nAdequate sleep\nManage stress levels\nFootnotes\n[1] \nHow Do Muscles Grow?\n[2] \nJournal of Applied Physiology", "authorship": "human"}

And the question that i got asked a few times was: “\nSo do you have 4th of July in your country where you came from?”. \nAt first I didn’t think much of it and politely answered “no” (as in we do not celebrate America’s independence day in my country).\n \nLater it felt a little odd when a middle aged bearded man with a bulging tummy asked me the same question. “\nSo do you have 4th of July in your country where you came from?”.\n Only this time I decided to play dumb and asked him back: “\nno, but what’s 4th of July all about anyway?”. \nTo which he answered: “\nOhhhh! You don’t know? it’s when we all come hang out, drink some beer and watch some fireworks!”. \nIt then struck me that he had no idea what the 4th of July was all about, and no! he wasn’t trying to pull my leg either.", "authorship": "human"}

She says “you can’t open a bank account, you need a (US) SSN and you’re not American”. I explain that yes you can open a bank account without being a US citizen and I do have a US SSN, see, this is my US SS Card. “Oh, so you’re American! Then I need your American ID!” No, I’m not American, you don’t need to be American to get an SSN.\n \nWe went round four or five times until I was finally able to get her to accept a dare: “listen, just type this SSN into your computer and see what it spits up, ok?”\n \nShe looked at me like she really wished she had glasses so she could glare over them and typed.\n \nLo and behold, the computer spit out… my name, SSN, an old account from that bank (now closed) and an address which happened to match my (expired therefore not valid) Florida driver’s license!\n \nShe and the branch manager also claimed that it was not possible to transfer money electronically from Spain and that the account didn’t have an IBAN (International Bank Account Number).

This forces the body to adapt. It doesn't adapt much to a stimulus that is easy for it to accomplish.\n \nBut...introduce some lighter weeks every 4-12 weeks, these tend to work themselves in quite naturally in my experience with busy folks as you go on vacation or get caught up in other things every now and then. However, the more experienced you get with training the more deliberately you should probably plan what we call de-loads.\n \nA few deloads within the year:\n \nAllows the body some recovery time to adapt to a repetitive stimulus given to it over a period of weeks or even months\nPrevents overdoing it \nGives you a bit of a mental break\nThat being said it's probably not really crucial for people just starting in with exercise as you won't be able to work at really high levels of intensity until you've been training for a little while (probably 3-6 months at a minimum).\n \nTraining should get progressively harder over time because your ability will get progressively better over time, but it should also be cyclical. You progress as much as you can over a period of time \n(usually about 4 weeks for most folks and to keep things relatively simple) \nthen back off a little and let nature do it's thing -- \ncompensate for all the training.\n \nWeight loss requires inefficient workouts, so you need to track your efficiency and improvement. If you're fast, then maybe distance based training is more inefficient. If you're good with distance than maybe speed based training is more inefficient. You want to cycle to more inefficient methods that your body isn't as comfortable with roughly every 4 or so weeks to keep your body adapting.\n \n30 minutes of walk/run is a good place to start but your body will quickly become adapted to that stimulus if it stays the same for too long. \n \nSo assuming you're only using this method, here are some ideas on what to track so you're progressively overloading your 30 minute walk/run:\n \nSpeed\nHeart Rate\nDistance\nRest\nSpeed\n \nIf you're running at 6mph and walking at 3mph then obviously bumping up your speeds means you're improving. Try to add 0.1 mph each time you go in to one or the other. This is assuming you're using something like a treadmill but you could do the same outside with a GPS tracker. \n \nThe faster you run the less length of time you'll be able to maintain that speed so faster intervals often require more rest and burn a little more. They are also generally more effective in my experience for fat loss, but periodic improvement, change and variety trumps high intensity interval training still.\n \nObviously the faster you go the more rest you need, but you might not want to start sprinting right away, work up to it over the first few months. \n \nHeart Rate\n \nRequires a heart rate monitor, I'd recommend a chest strap as they are the most accurate and will work with pretty much any kind of equipment at the gym. If you can work at a greater speed with a lower heart rate, then your cardiovascular fitness is improving, if you start to notice that improvement taper off over time (like after 4 weeks of training) then it's a good idea to switch what you're doing or switch what you're measuring.\n \nAnother thing you can watch for is what we call Heart Rate Recovery, or how quickly your heart rate comes back down after you run back to a walk. The faster this is, the more cardiovascularly fit you are and I'd argue this is more important in the grand scheme of things than heart rate alone. If the speed of your recovery tapers off, again you need a change and/or you should consider shortening your rest interval of your walk-run, or increasing the speed of one or the other.\n \nDistance\n \nIf you cover more distance with the same walk run protocol in the same time frame, obviously you improved speed. Covering more distance in the same time frame is an indication you are getting more fit, if this tapers off, again another indication that something needs to change. You could also simply make your objective to cover more distance and not worry about tracking speed. The difference of this metric is really just where your focus lies.\n \nRest\n \nLess walking while keeping your running at the same intensity is obviously harder. So you could choose to monitor this and rather than altering the above, just knock 5 seconds off your rest intervals each workout until you can't keep up to your previous work interval \n(an indication you've tapered off and need a change)\n. So you do 6 mph run for 2 minutes, 3 mph walk for 1 minute, then do 55 seconds, 50 seconds, 45 seconds, 40 seconds, 35 seconds, etc....keep the work interval the same if you use this method.\n \nPick one variable to monitor and change either every 4 weeks or when you notice that you're not improving that variable. Don't change a bunch of variables at once. For instance, if you are doing 2 minutes of running and 1 minute of walking, try to bump up your speed to as much as you can handle over a 4 week period, but don't also change the duration of the interval. Next 4 weeks, change the duration of the interval but try to keep the speed consistently as high as you can.

This also gives you a lot more opportunity for variety every 4 weeks, rather than changing too much at once.\n \nI'd say if 3 workouts in a row are far too similar in progress \n(i.e. you can't get a little bit faster, or take less rest, or run longer than you did 3-4 workouts before)\n then you need to change something, generally if you have enough variety in what you're tracking.\n \nThat's the general principle behind training.\n \nHowever, for fat loss, I'd highly recommend learning how to do some resistance training and add that into your routine every other day \n(conditioning work one day for 30 minutes, resistance training the next for 30 minutes) \nespecially full-body compound movements like squats, deadlifts, presses, pulls, etc...\n \nSee additionally, my answers to:\n \nWhat are the best ways to reduce and eliminate belly, abdominal, and thigh fat?\nHow do you customize a weight loss and exercise plan for yourself?\nWhat should everyone know about strength training and weightlifting?\nWhat is a realistic plan for losing 20% of my body weight?

Weight loss/fat loss/overall heatlh is like 75% diet, 25% exercise.  So you'll need to do some research on that first (some great sources are eattoperform or bengreenfieldfitness to start).\n \nAs for a weekly plan....  Honestly, I'm apprehesive to suggest anything specific simply because I don't know you or your body and how you respond to movement.  The exercises you mentioned - dance, strength, yoga and running - are all very effective in helping with gaining strength and improving cardio health.  I say try one each day and see what you're drawn to.  You can also try high intensity training (also known at HIT or HIIT).  Even try studios like Orangetheory, Pure Barre, even Crossfit.  See what you'll like and what you're willing to continue with. What piques your interest is what you'll be willing to dedicate your time to and work for.\n \nI do agree that running for weight loss is a tricky topic.  I suggest you do more research on it.  But doing sprints and tempo runs work really well with increasing VO2 max capacities and help bring you into a fat burning mode instead of sugar burning (this is ben greenfield's aim).  \n \nAlternate your workouts.  Don't forget to build in rest.  And working out a solid hour a day HARD isn't necessary.  Get your heart rate up 20-30 minutes a day for strength training and cardio.  Work your body hard during that short time...push yourself.  It'll be more effective than spending an hour in the gym mindlessly lifting weights.  Give yourself some bodywork therapy (pilates, yoga) to balance out the other workouts (those can be an hour - 90 min).   \n \nFinally, while I don't feel comfortable giving  you a specific workout, I can tell you what's worked for me in the past:\n \nDay 1 - strength training (20-30) with a trainer...hard\n \nDay 2 - sprint or tempo work\n \nDay 3 - Pilates\n \nDay 4 - strength training\n \nDay 5 - spring or tempo work \n \nDay 6 - Yoga\n \nDay 7 - Rest\n \nSince I'm a Pilates instructor, I usually do Pilates mat/props 5-6 days a week.  But those listed on the above schedule are sessions in the studio either guided by another instructor or myself on the machinery.   \n \nSo...\nfind studios/workouts/trainers that you'll stick with which also push you\ndo strength training and hard cardio 20-30 min on those designated days\ntry hour long classes for dance, yoga, and pilates\ndon't forget to rest\nwork your diet to support your new activities\nGood luck!!", "authorship": "human"}

One Proposer and Seconder from each side of the debate (Pro and Anti) to state their proposition , followed by Q and A with the audience. Following what I believe is an almost Universal practice amongst School debating clubs, the “Pro” team and the “Anti” team picked their preference at the start of the debate so all teams would have to be well read on BOTH sides of the argument and be prepared to back up their arguments EVEN WHEN the proposition was against their personal beliefs.\n \nOne of these was on the subject of Nuclear Arms and the arguments for and against Nuclear Weapons as a whole. I was seconding a guy called Nigel (the Head Boy) and a friend of Mine, Eddie, was seconding Peter the Deputy Head Boy. We were Pro (or the dirty, stinking Warmongers) and Eddie and Peter were Anti Nuclear Arms (God’s favourite children). The result, a forgone conclusion, but, hey, a good excuse for a nice, dirty, verbal scrap.\n \nThings became heated and rules of courtesy and tact disappeared as immoderate statements were made by each team (and their supporters) impugning the motives, ethics and morals of the Opposition. During this period, Eddie and I got into one of these verbal ‘scrap’ and I was asked by him what I would do if I heard the famous “Four Minute Warning” sound across the Town.\n \nI retorted, quick as a flash “”I’ve read all about the things we are likely to expect in a Post Holocaust World, and I wouldn’t want to stay here and watch it happen. If that Missile was falling on Maesteg, then I’d want to try and get directly underneath it….”.\n \nEddie laughed. It was a scornful laugh. It expressed a depth of contempt for my words that, quite frankly, hurt a little. When his laughter had subsdided, he looked at me and said, EVEN MORE scornfully :-\n \n“Stand underneath it ???!!!

Cardiovascular exercise: Include some form of cardio to improve your cardiovascular fitness and burn calories. You can choose activities like jogging or running in place, jumping rope, high knees, or dancing. Perform cardio exercises for 20-30 minutes, aiming for moderate to high intensity.\n \n4. Core exercises: Strengthen your core with exercises like planks, mountain climbers, Russian twists, and bicycle crunches. Include 2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions for each exercise.\n \n5. Flexibility work: Finish your routine with some stretching exercises to improve flexibility and prevent muscle tightness. Focus on stretches for major muscle groups, including your legs, hips, back, shoulders, and chest. Hold each stretch for 20-30 seconds.\n \n6. Rest and recovery: Allow your body time to rest and recover between workout sessions. Aim for at least one day of rest per week to prevent overtraining and promote muscle growth.\n \nRemember, it's important to start with exercises that match your current fitness level and gradually increase intensity and resistance as you get stronger.

To an extent. Small micro tears from training will stimulate new repairs and extra bulk be added to the muscle fibers. So if you had to carry or life a 50 pound object everyday, at first it will be hard, eventually it would get easier until it'll be no effort at all.  But eventually the body will adapt to the point where you need to add more weight if you want to get stronger or bigger. \n \nThat's the principle of overload and profession. \n \nThe principle of specificity basically says, if you want to get good at running, run more. Specify in what you want to achieve in. If you want to be able to life more weight, life more weight. If you want to be a good mountain climber, climb more mountains etc.\n \nSo there you have it. To get stronger you need to do more. Stress the body more. \n \nLook into nutrition. Much of \"reaping the benefits\" of training occur in the kitchen. Consume healthy fats and proteins.

So I'm not as stretchy and yoga is actually a bit more painful (I appreciate wooden people's yoga feats more now), which in turn led me to more running.

In fact training in a “fasted state” (that means with no food eaten for at least 12 hours or more) is probably the \nmost beneficial for weight loss.\n \nThe body has finite storage capacity and will \nnever use fat while you still have stored glucose energy (glycogen for those that love the science)\n \nIt just would not do that.\n \nIf you are trying to \nbuild muscle while staying lean \nthen you need to keep a close eye on protein. \nHigh protein is pointless \n(unless your are selling protein shakes and bars!) The body can not store excess protein. Again it’s the body having finite storage capacity.

When you wake up HGH is high, and lowers when you start eating. If you buzz to the gym and take some water with a pinch of pink Himalayan salt with you then you can workout with the elevated human growth hormone still circulating. The salted water is the best for rehydration.\n \nHydration is often thought of as loss of water, it’s actually loss of electrolytes that’s the issue. Hence the pink salt.\n \nLastly some think water increases metabolic rate. It does, temporarily. But this is only because the body works to bring the temperature of the cold water up to body temperature. If you really want to be geeky about training \nnever drink cold water unless it is to bring your temperature down. It’s a 3% lose of workout energy while it raise the water temperature up.\n \nIt’s really minimal though.\n \nBut to answer your question in a more basic way\n \nThe best time to go is when suits you best.

But that is for people with especially good recovery abilities.\n \nIt amazes me how much the bodybuilding industry has confused the shit out of people. Telling them to workout 6 times per week, eat 2 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight, and other useless nonsense. Sure that works for the guys taking steroids, but all it does for a natural trainer is lead them nowhere. Yeah, you might experience results in a few months, but after that you’ll stagnate.\n \nFull-body workouts on the other hand, are the perfect routines for natural trainers. They offer enough volume, but not too much to where you can’t recover from. In addition, you’re joints and central nervous system get more of a break and time to recover because you’re not training as often.\n \nAll you need in a full-body workout is a major push, a major pull, and a major legs exercise. The intermediate and advance could also benefit from some assistance exercises for the arms and calves. But other than that, this is all you will ever need to grow. I currently am 6′1 and weigh 203 lbs, at 11 percent body fat. And I have been on a maintenance routine only lifting weights twice per week and sprinting on a third day. I haven’t gained any mass (hence the maintenance routine) but I still have continued to gain strength. One of my example workouts was this:\n \nWeighted Dips: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nWeighted Chin-ups: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nSquats: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nCalf raises and forearms: 2–3 sets of 10–15 reps\n \nWill you get to be 250 at 5 % body fat and become some absolute beast?? Hell no, not even close. But no natural trainer will ever get that close. If you are around 6 feet tall, the most you can ever expect to weight at 10 percent body fat is probably 215 to 220. And those numbers are for someone with very great genetics.\n \nI love how people think they need to follow the split routines 6 days per week because everyone else is doing it.\n \nWell, how many people do you see that are big and strong? Not many. How many people do you see at the gym following those splits who are actually big and NOT taking steroids? Probably zero.\n \nI talk about this in great detail in my book which you can find here: \nBasic But Brutal", "authorship": "human"}

Her father is a doctor at a prestigious teaching medical school. She grew up in one of the most affluent suburbs of America, attending the best public schools possible — you know, it’s one of those places where Chinese is taught in public schools. She went to college without a single debt.\n \nAnd here’s the clincher — she had traveled extensively through Europe after college. She loved to recount how she had traveled for a few months, going from one city to another. It seems that at no point did she look at a map of Europe and consider the possibility of visiting Venice or Vienna, two of the most famous European cities.\n \nLastly, I would like to say how much I hated working with this co-worker and her proud ignorance. I worked in sales that frequently happened over the phone. Often, when I was on the phone with a client, she would eavesdrop (open office and she seemed to have the most amazing hearing — I suppose to make up for her other deficits), and she would shout out what she thought the answer should be. Of course, it never occurred to her that she was only hearing one side of the conversation and, therefore, her shouted answers were always wrong!", "authorship": "human"}

I was really excited to meet and interact (rampage) with other people from all over the world. So I got to it right away.\n \nAfter a while, I had already formed a 'crew' in the game. We had 4 Americans, an Indian and a coincidentally, a fellow Nigerian. We had a lot of fun there, driving around and chatting away. Then one day, some other American came in to talk to us. Upon reading my name tag (which also displayed the country the player is from), the first thing he said was,\n \n“You're from Nigeria?”\n \n“Yes”\n \n“That's impossible, Nigeria has no internet”.\n \nI was dumbfounded. Apparently, this guy thought I was lying in the middle of the desert in “Africa”, taking a well deserved break from herding the cattle, fighting Lions and what not; saying enchantments that would enable me to use the “white man's web” to connect with these other people to control my character on the magic screen in front of me. Me and my new friends tried to convince him that Nigeria, and pretty much the rest of the world did infact have internet but he still stood his ground. It turned out that this guy was a complete jackass. Soon he deemed it necessary to use the “N” word in every sentence he made knowing full well there were two blacks talking with him. Lucky for him I didn't feel particularly offended by the word at the time. He also made jokes about how dark I am, even though I am actually lightskinned. This guy went on to insult the Indian too, calling him “terrorist” and other bad \nnames\n. As if being from an Asian country that isn't China or Vietnam= Terrorist! And he actually expected the other Americans to side with him, even asking them what they were possibly doing, mingling with us 'inferiors'. Fortunately, the other people, being more sensible than him, refused and called him out on his bullshit.\n \nHe then went on to insult our countries, called us 'poor', ' hungry' and even dared me to go outside and tell a policeman I didn't believe in Allah to prove how 'free' my country was ( disregarding the fact I live in the southern and predominantly Christian part of the country). This was around the time a Nigerian man hijacked a plane in the US so for a while, Nigeria was considered an “anti-US” country.\n \nThis went on for a while, so we had no choice but to murder the jerk and move on (video game, remember). This brief encounter led me to believe that all Americans were rude, ignorant Jacka**es and this stuck with me for a while. Although now I know that not all Americans are dumb. But the sad truth is that there are still a LOT of ignoramuses, perhaps even more than the smart ones, and this means people are more likely to meet an ignorant American. But the truth is EVERY country has dumb people, and singling out one country to pick on it is wrong. Maybe it's because USA is the current top dog. So everyone expects them to know everything about the rest of the world, like a father would.\n \nAlso I see a lot of people saying things like\n \n“Americans aren't dumb, we have GEDs!!”\n \nWell, that is as relevant as saying a tiger isn't aggressive because you saw it climb a tree.\n \n“Dumb” in this context refers to “uninformed”, not “uneducated”.", "authorship": "human"}

Mostly because of my Mother’s teaching…she always say we are not poor; we have a roof over our head, we are able to go to school, we have food despite the difficulty and most of all we have each other to lean on. This I had strongly believed was and will always be my greatest treasure in life. No one is poor as one way or another we have wealth in each of us, and this wealth can never be measure by how much money you have in the bank or how expensive your gadgets are. Knowledge is wealth, good health is wealth, love is wealth, genuine Friends is wealth and Everyone in this world is born and raised with these Wealth all around us. This is the world’s way of being fair to Everyone, by being unfair; No one can have it all.

I felt terrible.\n \nHe sat there in silence for a while, then called me over to his desk and wrote some notes. I sat there dry-mouthed and exhausted from my flight and his behaviour. Eventually he looked up and said “ok, you can go”. I stood up to walk away but just couldn’t. I thought there is no way I can enjoy being in this country after this experience.\n \nI desperately looked around for something to say to show I wasn’t going to take all this nonsense. I saw he had a ring on his finger. Out of desperation I said “what’s that ring for?”. He said “I won it in the Super Bowl”. I replied “no you didn’t, you liar. That’s a class ring”. He said “what do you know about football anyway? You guys just kick that stupid little white soccer ball around”. I said “I know more about your football than you do”. He said “yeah? Let’s just see about that”. He hit me with a number of questions about the NFL. I answered everything with ease. He couldn’t believe it! He shouted “oh! Check this guy out! Ask him anything about the NFL!”. All his buddies crowded around the desk and I put my feet up on it LOL.

I asked her what the problem was with moving over there? Was it the economy and how expensive some things were over there? No. Was it being so far from family? No. Was it because they had to board pets in quarantine for a while (I couldn't remember if they had pets)? No.\n \nAfter I finally ran out of reasons why the move could be so traumatic, I flat out asked her. It turns out she was feeling overwhelmed by all the things needed to be done in preparation of the move, and the need to get a passport.\n \n\"Passport? That's cool, plan on doing a little traveling on the way to Hawaii? Where are you going?\"\n \nShe looked at me like I suddenly grew a leg out of my head. \"We're just going to Hawaii.\"\n \nBefuddled I asked why they would need to get a passport if they weren't planning on doing any foreign travel. \"Because it's Hawaii!\"\n \n\"You do know that Hawaii is one of the states in the US, right?\"\n \n\"Of course, I'm not stupid.\"\n \n\"I only said that because passports are only needed for foreign travel, and I can't imagine a flight from here would take you to a foreign country\"\n \n\"It's because we have to fly over the ocean.\"\n \n\"...\"\n \nBecause apparently flying over the ocean means you have to obtain a passport. She was also worried about learning a new language... she didn't believe me that English was the primary language spoken there.\n \nHeh.\n \nI ran into her randomly last year in the DC area and asked if they ever managed to get in some foreign travel since they already had their passports (because of course she went got them since I was clearly wrong).

You could set experience \novertraining syndrome\n, where your body cannot recover enough between workouts.\n \nAdditionally, your body requires a certain amount of time to recover between workouts. If you’re providing enough stimulus to your muscles this is usually between 36 and 48 hours (\ndepending on the muscle worked (muscles like your core tend to recover faster\n), your gender (\nwomen tend to recover faster than men)\n, the intensity that you worked the muscle (\nthe harder you worked it the longer it will take)\n, your age (\nover 60 you will require as much as 96 hours rest to recover between workouts), \nthe nutrition applied, and your hormone profile (\nmore testosterone, HGH, IGF will lead to quicker recovery when coupled with adequate amounts of protein and glucose\n)).\nIf you don’t give it enough time, you won’t build up past your initial baseline, and your muscles will suffer.\n \nAs metabolic fatigue builds up, even in lighter intensity training, you’ll feel it all over. It could be something simple at first — you stop improving in your lifts, for example. Eventually you start getting worse. Soon you start getting injuries that aren’t healing. You start to feel depressed. Even one day off with complete relaxation or even a light walk could be enough to clear you out, if you catch it early enough. Serious cases of overtraining could require more time.\n \nTo re-iterate:\nIf you don’t work it over 80% intensity every day\nIf you \ndo\n take a break once every 1–2 weeks\nYou’ll be fine.\n \nIf you notice things going wrong — you start feeling weaker, you stop improving, you start feeling like crap in general, you start getting injuries…take a step back. Rest. Recover.\nBrief anecdote as illustration\n \nOnce I was really working my pull ups. I was stuck at 18. I would do them daily, at least 4 sets. I hit 18 every time in my first set, I ended up doing about 50 a day. At first I was gaining daily, I went from 8 to 10 to 14, to 18…but then the growth stopped. I was stuck there for a couple weeks.\n \nI took 2 days off from doing pull ups.\n \nThe next time I stepped up to the bar I did 25 in my first set.\n \nI’m not saying that you’ll have dramatic results like this, but sometimes the missing part of your workout is actually \nnot\n working out.", "authorship": "human"}

I was over-trained; I had an intense weight training session the day before and was just coming off playing nine innings.  “More is better” was my mantra, but I was naïve.\n \nAt 23, I lifted heavy weights every day. Now, I lift three days a week. I’m not quite as strong, but I’m inching closer to that 500 pound threshold now that I understand the importance of rest and recovery.  If I understood how the body repairs itself when I was a rookie, I would have been stronger, healthier, and a better baseball player.\n \nIt’s essential to incorporate recovery days into your program so your muscles can adequately repair themselves, grow and become stronger. When we train with weights, we actually create small tears in our muscle fibers. Those fibers then repair and rebuild bigger and stronger while we rest.  If you don’t build in that downtime, you break the muscle fibers down further reducing the chance for solid growth and increasing the risk of injury.\n \nIf your ultimate goal is size and strength, avoid weight training, even targeting separate muscle groups, on consecutive days.\n \nYour body only builds muscle when you are not weight training.

Referred to as “that terrorist”.\n \nAsked if my parents make bombs at home or if my parents plan to kill people.\n \nStared down by most, including some teachers especially on September 11th of every year.\n \nOne high school teacher asked me if the country where I am from is where they don't allow women to have orgasm and cut their clitoris and if I was subjected to the mutilation (I am obviously middle Eastern, and he was talking about an African country so No. I was not subjected to any mutilation.) He was actually an open minded teacher and I don't think he was trying to come across as ignorant but he did.\n \nA lot of people don't realize that when you migrate to the United States, 99% of people want a better life. They are usually escaping from something that is destroying the quality of their life. Middle Eastern run from extremists as well as poverty and lack of choices. Mexican are running from poverty, gang violence, and much more. Syrians are running from their OWN government. Everyone wants a better quality of life so they run from a country that no longer allows them to be physically or emotionally comfortable. So accusing them to be terrorists and rapists only makes the situation worse for them and they feel unaccepted in a new country that they were hoping would provide them new opportunities; where they won't feel threatened by the environment around them.\n \nIt's sad. It lets you down. Immigrants are grateful for this nation more than its own natural citizens. We come here and we work HARD. We become entrepreneurs, encourage our children to do better in school because not all of us had the opportunity to go to school, we pay taxes and help this country's economy. No one is more grateful for this nation than the immigrants because we know what this country means to us. We have lived in hell before. If I think United States is paradise, then why would I want anyone to threaten my paradise?\n \nI have met ignorant people through out my life each more ignorant than the other. I also meet people that welcome me and are grateful for my presence as I am for theirs. They understand the struggle my family and I have gone through.\n \nI am proud to say that my parents has built a beautiful life for themselves. We never were offered government assistance and we never asked for it either. I had to get FAFSA for school and it was not a grant it was a loan. We never have lived under welfare. It took us 13 years to finally get a visa to move here. We didn't magically get invited. My family was thoroughly wetted. Inspectors surprise visited our home for an inspection multiple times. Paper work over paperwork and interview over interview. Questions like these were asked: Why did we want to come to the US?, What are our intentions?, How were we going to support ourselves?, Why didn't we want to stay where we were? What did we have to offer the United States?, And hours worth of more questions.\n \nIf we didn't want to better our lives, we would have not gone through the struggle that it took to get here. In no way do I or my family intends to harm the US or it's people. Yet people choose to not understand that. It's easier to say that we are harmful and threatening than to understand that we just want to LIVE.\n \nI guess I experienced more ignorance in school than outside of school because kids aren't afraid to express themselves and what they hear from their parents.", "authorship": "human"}

Genuine over training IS a thing but it’s hard to get there unless you work out like a fiend and don’t eat/sleep enough.\n \nThat said, not everybody has the same goals or even the desire to be in the gym as much as me. This is totally understandable. So if you WANT to go to the gym seven days a week, go for it…get a split that makes sense and make sure you eat/sleep enough.\n \nI also highly recommend a joint supplement if you’re going to train this much.

If you’re trying to put on size, you need to be eating 1g to 1.5 g of protein/per lb of bodyweight (example: 100lb male needs to ingest 100g-150g of protein/daily). I’d try eating 30gr of protein immediately within 30 minutes of waking up (see Tim Ferriss’s 4 hour Body book for more info regarding that.\n \nAlso just challenge yourself in new ways. Try gymnastic moves like handstands, try perfecting a perfect 15 second handstand hold. Or construct your own parrallete bars out of PVC pipes, and practice doing an L-sit hold. These isometric types of exercises are great for the home gym lifter, and will tax you in a ways you’re not used to. Something that is severely overlooked in weightlifting is grip strength.

We, a marching band set up for November football games in New England fall/winter means that our only uniform was a warm wool one. Yeah. We marched in that, in Disney, in April. Two kids passed out from heat stroke, and one from heat exhaustion. Two out of three, although I don’t know how many had heat cramps. So… definitely some ignorance there in regards to the “right uniform for the gig”.\n \nBut no… this was at some point when we were on our own, and a few of us went into get ice cream on Main Street.

If you can already do 3 x 20 or 3 x 25, do that instead. I am doing 3 x 50, trying to get to 4 x 50.\nBodyweight squats - I know, bodyweight for anything isn’t as flashy as “LiFtInG mAd WeIgHtS bRo” but bodyweight squats, when done for high reps, will help strengthen and tone your quads which will then help when you actually perform squats with a higher weight. I personally do 3 x 40 for these but I’d start at 3 x 20 or 3 x 25 for someone just starting.\nCalf Raises - These can be done with bodyweight, dumbbells, or the machine at the gym. All 3 work great and unless you’re a neanderthal and don’t stretch beforehand, you shouldn’t get hurt doing these. These help with strengthening your calves (no shit) which will help with running for athletes and overall, aesthetically, I have had my calves commented on just as much as my upper body. I do 3 x 15 for these on the machine, but I load up the weight to 290 lbs. For bodyweight, I do around 3 x 30.\nBench Press - Bench press is probably the most common staple of any chest workout and for good reason. It not only helps with delivering a good pump to the pecs but it also seems to help with filling out the shoulders which for a lot of skinny guys working out is a huge plus. Dumbbells are great to start with as they teach balance and force you to use your pecs and not just your triceps and forearms to lift them. I do either 2 x 8 for this with 225 lbs or 3 x 12 with 165 pounds. I would start with a basic 3 x 10 with whatever weight you can do safely as a beginner.\nDeadlifts - Holy shit start light with this. People watch strongmen deadlift 1,000 pounds and they're like “Oh if they can do that then 300 is a breeze for me”. THAT IS THE WRONG APPROACH TO ANY WORKOUT LET ALONE ONE THAT CAN REALLY FUCK YOU UP IF YOU DO IT WRONG! This strengthens your back, core, quads, and triceps among many other muscles when done right. I do this 3 x 5 with 405 pounds. I have been doing these for 5 years though and have built up to that. Start at 135 pounds and do high reps to get your form down. There is no shame in doing these, or frankly any workout, with a coach or trainer to get your form down. Safety is more important than “MaD gAiNz BrO”.\nThis is not a definitive list and I am not a medical doctor or professional trainer. This is how I was trained for lacrosse and it has worked pretty well for me functionally and aesthetically ever since. Granted there are other workouts like curls that I mostly do to have some “flashy” muscle but otherwise, my workout is based around cardio endurance, strength, and being able to react quickly (which is more of a stretching thing but that’s a different topic for another time).\n \nFirst and foremost, workout to be healthy. Don’t try to be a pro bodybuilder unless you understand what it takes. By that I mean, are you willing to do steroids? Are you willing to eat waaaayyyyyy too much protein than is healthy? Are you willing to give up hours upon hours of time chasing a fleeting feeling that will never satisfy you even if you are the best in the world? If you can answer all of those with yes honestly the fine, you know the risks and that’s that.\n \n(BTW not knocking bodybuilders at all. Half of my lifting buddies are bodybuilders and they are some of the coolest people I know. It takes years of hard work, even with steroids, to get to that level. I can’t do bodybuilding because of my health as I already have high Test levels and I really don’t want to fuck with that.

Also, it can help you find domains with the same name and variations, buying those can help you to protect your brand.\n \nProtect your privacy\n - make sure that privacy protection is activated for your domain name. This will hide your private data from the WHOIS database.\n \nBe fast to be first\n - hurry up as the domain you want can be bought within seconds!\nAnalyze the blogs you like.\n It is so much easier to start with an example. I am not talking about copying others, just getting some inspiration and finding successful methods. Don’t forget to analyze which blogs are getting the most traffic - SimilarWeb can help you out with that. If a blog is getting a lot of traffic, research what could be the key factors of that. \nYou can even analyze the SEO strategy of other websites! \nNeil Patel\n allows you to do that through his own website.\nRemember that SEO is important but Content is still the king.\n No one ever got traffic without doing anything BUT it doesn’t mean that expensive ads will give you what you want. The most important thing here is content and you need to \nmake sure it’s rock-solid\n, though \nSEO\n is also playing a huge role in blogging.\nSet up social media platforms.\n Online presence is important and using social media can help you increase your user engagement. It’s the best tool to notify people about new articles and plans. Facebook and Instagram can help you grow and receive feedback from your readers directly. Also, you can implement the links from your blog post to Facebook and Instagram to gain more followers there and create a community for them. \nAs social media channels (and even effective ones) the personal profiles can be used too. A lot of bloggers have their blogs linked in the “About me” section of their Facebook and Instagram profiles. Self-promotion for friends and followers can increase traffic and popularity.\nCreate a top-notch design.\n Even when content is so important, you have to make sure that your visitors can easily read it and find it. The eye-catching design is a must to keep the readers in the blog for more than a few seconds. You can create a design yourself, or you can use existing templates - WordPress has a lot of them! If you have no idea about the latest trends, give a shot for a minimalistic look. It will make your blog look more professional and easy to navigate.\nCongrats! Now your blog is ready to storm the internet. Be sure to keep it updated and it will stay on the successful path. Here Google Analytics and other platforms that help to track your blog growth or plan its future will come in handy. \nA goal without a plan is just a wish, so make it real and enjoy the journey!", "authorship": "human"}

Within 10 minutes of waking up I'm in my gym clothes. I keep my key, headphones, water bottle and iPad near the front door so I take them all as I head out to the gym. Same thing if you run or walk to workout.\n \nI think the reason so few folks swim or bike for exercise anymore is because of the friction. You have to wear special apparel, shower after and wash out the chlorine (another reason why saltwater pools are much better), and then soak your bathing suit, swim cap, googles in water to get the chlorine out, etc.\n \nUnless you work from home, try having two gyms you like - one near work and another near home. In each case, pick the gyms closest to you that you will actually work out in. \n \nI had a home elliptical and a gym 10 feet from my doorstep. I didn't use either much. Now I work out daily because I like my gym and figured out a routine.\n \nWhen I worked in New York, I had two gyms - a free one a work and an Equinox across the street from my home for which I had a work discount. I used both a lot. At one point, the trainer at the work gym said \"Terrence, you don't need to come every day.\" I worked out a lot sometimes. I joined the Reebok gym briefly but it was too far. So even though it was even nicer than Equinox, I worked out more at Equinox.\n \nThe Workout\n. Here's what works for me. I do the 15% max incline on the treadmill in our building's gym. I listen to music, use my iPad and have a water bottle. I do between 20 min to 4 hours of cardio a day, depending. Average is probably 80 minutes. \n \nWhy do I do a 15% incline? Because it is less strain on my knees and back to walk uphill than to run at 0-2% incline. And I can do stuff on my iPad while I'm walking.\n \nAlmost anyone can do this workout. It is super easy. And you can make it hard. Just walk much faster and longer and you'll get a pretty good workout after awhile.\n \nI keep track of my heart rate so its between fat burn and a good burn but not dangerous. Then I try to stretch or lift weights. High reps, low weight. I'm trying to avoid injury so easing into weights. Once I build this into a habit, I will switch it up a bit and do stationary bike, stair climbing, rowing, etc. \n \nRest. \nI take Saturdays off. Mostly because I get up at 5.30am every Saturday to hop on a plane. So I'm already a bit exhausted on most Saturdays. But also partly to stay sane and reward myself.

I am pretty confident in stating, that none of them are on Quora. If you don’t have enough money to eat, you aren’t going to spend the little you have on accessing the internet.

Otherwise you’d be playing the same guys on the same level and that shit would get old real quick because there was no challenge.\n \nThat’s kinda how your workout is. If you’re doing the same reps with the same weight, eventually your body is going to get bored because there is no challenge. It already built up the muscle and strength needed to lift that weight.\n \nThere’s no reason for your body to progress because it can handle the stress you are giving it through your workout.\n \nJust like the video games you enjoyed, you need to hit the next level to see results.\n \nLEVERS OF PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD\nWhen it comes to progressive overload there are a few levers you can adjust to increase the challenge.\n \nWeight\n: Arguably the most used and abuse lever. The concept is simple, add more weight to the bar.\n \nReps\n: Increase the number of reps you can lift a certain weight for.\n \nSets\n: Increase the number of sets per exercise.\n \nTime Under Tension\n: Increase the time your muscles need to support the weight.\n \nRest Periods\n: Decreasing the time between sets.\n \nTraining Frequency\n: Adding another day of hitting a muscle group without being debilitatingly sore.\n \nEach week work one of these levers to add progressive overload to your muscles.\n \nBut this is when it starts getting hairy because a haphazard approach could lead to gainz in the short term. Unfortunately, muscle isn’t built in the short term, it’s a long term project so you’ll need a plan.\n \nTHE PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD METHOD\nThere’s a few different methods for ensuring progressive overload in your workouts. The most basic one is called a Single Progression method.\n \nSingle (or Linear) Progression Method:\n Basically each workout you increase the weight on a lift.\n \nLet’s say you can bench 225 for 8 reps.\n \nWeek 1: 225 for 8 reps\n \nWeek 2: 230 for 8 reps\n \nWeek 3: 235 for 8 reps\n \nEtc.\n \nOn paper this is pretty sweet. But for anyone that has ever lifted a weight ever, you know damn well shit doesn’t go that smoothly.\n \nEventually, you’ll hit a point where you can’t get 8 reps with good form. You’ll get 5 solid reps and 3 cockeyed-am-I-gonna-die reps.\n \nSide Note: IMO this is a piss-poor way to progress. It’s very short sighted.\n \nDouble Progression Method:\n In this method you increase reps first then weight.\n \nSay you can bench 225 lbs for 8 reps.\n \nWeek 1: 225 for 8 reps\n \nWeek 2: 225 for 9 reps\n \nWeek 3: 225 for 10 reps\n \nWeek 4: 235 for 8 reps\n \nWeek 5: 235 for 9 reps\n \nEtc.\n \nI like this method much better than the Single Progression because it allows you to get stronger and “milk” the results from a certain weight.\n \nFor this, I like to work in rep brackets rather than just a target number of reps per set. Instead of saying 3 sets of 10 reps, I would give my clients something like 3 sets of 8-10 reps or change the desired reps in each workout within that bracket.\nThis way you have a range to progress and you know where the ceiling is to increase the weight. Once you hit the top of the range on all your sets, drop the reps to the bottom of the bracket and increase the weight.\n \nThis is the best for busy individuals with time restriction to their workouts. It takes an extra min to add another rep to each set.\n \nTriple Progression Method: \nIn this method you first increase the reps, then sets and finally weight.\n \nBringing back our benching example:\n \nWeek 1: 225 for 3 sets of 8 reps\n \nWeek 2: 225 for 3 sets of 9 reps\n \nWeek 3: 225 for 3 sets of 10 reps\n \nWeek 4: 225 for 4 sets of 8 reps\n \nWeek 5: 225 for 4 sets of 9 reps\n \nWeek 6: 225 for 4 sets of 10 reps\n \nWeek 7: 235 for 3 sets of 8 reps\n \nEtc.\n \nFor this method I would still keep the rep bracket and only increase 1 set before increasing the weight. Depending on how many exercises you do this on, you can easily add another 10-15 mins to your workout.\n \nHOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU USE PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD\n \nThe first week of a new workout is the feeling out process.\n \nFinding the right weight for each exercise, how the exercise sequence flows with the flow of everyone else in the gym (i.e. are you waiting on equipment) and learning the right form for new exercises.\n \nLet’s assume we are using a double progression method here.\n \nSo for week 1, I always tell my clients do the workout as-is and pick a weight where you get close to failure at the lower end of a rep bracket.\n \nIn week 2 you’ll know what to expect and we can start pushing a little more. Try increasing reps on all sets.\n \nWeek 3 through whenever: Once you can hit the top of the rep bracket on all the sets. Increase the weight and drop the reps back down.\n \nNow if you change your workout every 4 weeks you probably won’t be able to see the increase in weight right away. Odds are you’ll still be trying to increase the reps by the end of the fourth week.\n \nWhich is fine. It’s still progressive overload and you’re still getting closer to your goal.\n \nIf you like your workout, stick to it. There’s no harm in going 6-7-8 weeks with one workout program. If anything you’ll get really good at those particular lifts and not to \nmention stronger\n.\n \nAfter about 12 weeks or so, I would say you need to switch the exercises up a little just because you’ll be building weaknesses in the areas that aren’t the focus of your particular workout. Plus, if you’re doing something like heavy squatting for 12 consecutive weeks your hips and knees will need a break.\n \nWILL YOU PROGRESS EVERY WEEK?\n \nAbsolutely not.\n \nSome workouts are just going to suck.\n \nOthers are going to be a cake walk.\n \nThe fact of the matter is that you have a lot of shit going on in your life which can drain some gym energy. The important thing is to try to do more each week.\n \nSometimes you’ll get there. And the more and more you advance into your weight lifting career the harder it is to make progress.\n \nIf you’re a gym noob, I would expect week over week improvement for the first 6 months or so.\n \nIf you’re a little more advanced I would expect every couple of weeks you’ll see in increase.\n \nIf you’re\n advanced\n, first off I have zero idea why you’d be reading this, but anyways…If you’re advanced once every couple of months seeing an increase.\n \nAnd that is progressive overload. Now go build some muscles.\n \nAesthetic Physiques", "authorship": "human"}

Here’s the actual answer below.\nWell, all those things which I have, were actually bought by my father during the period when he was earning decently \naround 25k per month\n in a good marketing company with his genuine efforts during years \n2010–2015\n (except house). He was working there since 2003, but earned less than that earlier.\n \nLater, there were issues with the company and my father switched to another company and there was a\n sudden and extreme downfall in the income source\n. Note that though he is intelligent and hard-working, he is \nnot even a 12th-pass student.\n Yet he is \nthe only earning member\n in our house!\n \nOur present home was owned by my grandfather and father \nback in 90s\n when they came to Mumbai first. It’s rate was somewhere around \n50k\n those days.\n \nThe first 5 electronic gadgets we own (as listed above) were all bought during those 5 years (2010–2015)\n as there was \na technical aspirant growing up in the house\n and hence it became a necessity. We had a marginal budget though to buy those gadgets with our good savings back then. \nHence, the better of the cheapest gadgets!\n \nSome of you might ask how I afforded to study Engineering in a private college like \nVidyalankar Institute of Technology\n. It’s simple! \nWhen your father recognizes your dedication and hard work, he makes sure he earns and save that much! \nHe’s called father for a reason!\n \nAnyway I got \n40% of fees (about ₹45k) waived off\n, thanks to my caste. \n(That gratitude was only for assisting my hard work and situation, not otherwise!)\n.\n \nI still use the \nsame phone\n as it shows no signs of getting old even after \n7 years\n and I deal only with my phone calls and messages through it. I still use the \nsame laptop\n even though \nits battery and hinges are damaged\n as I get to connect to the Internet through it. Don’t get surprised! I have a mere\n 600kbps local internet pack\n which is enough to play a YouTube video without getting buffered.\n \nMy father being newly joined to the company now, earns very less than former company but enough to pay at least the important and only bills like \nelectricity, water, mobile and internet\n without fail!\n Thankfully there’s no concept of \nmaintenance charges\n in one-room-kitchen house.\n \nNow, I’ll tell you why I mentioned things I don’t have.\n \nThose are the things which motivate me, help me, make me work hard and morally boost myself to succeed and enjoy a better life, for me and my parents. They have and are still striving hard to raise me up. Now that I’ve almost completed graduation in Engineering \nit’s my time to grab opportunities, fly high and bring back the bright version of life which my parents expect!\nSo, yes, there are poor people on Quora because all you need to have is a \nwillingness\n to learn/know new things, a little bit of \ntechnical knowledge\n to login to Quora from any device and of course \nsome money \nto recharge internet or use someone’s internet service!\n \nTo summarize my answer, any person staying in this suburban city of Mumbai can compare the amounts I mentioned in my answer and are intelligent enough to declare me \na poor person on Quora\n!\n \nThank you! :)\nEDIT - 29 Sept 2020 :\n \nI felt the need to edit this answer due to the overwhelming response and the blessings I had over the years. I \ngot a decent job \nin mid-2017 and I’m working since then. My salary is in a decent lower 5 digit figure now.\n \nIn these 3 years, I saved money and purchased my first smartphone of 5K INR within a year. Recently, due to the memory issue of the previous smartphone, I purchased \na new good quality budget smartphone of 16K INR\n so that I can use it for more years.\n \nI also purchased \na good quality laptop with decent high specifications of 44K INR\n, again for the same reason. I always believe in saving money and purchasing good quality products and maintaining them for the long term.\n \nI’m still learning new technologies with the help of the internet and the devices I have now. I still have a long way to go! Thanks! :)", "authorship": "human"}

You can also do moderate and vigorous cardio at the same time.\nResistance exercises (lifting or bodyweight exercises) should target major muscle groups 2-3 times a week.\nFlexibility training should be done 2-3 times a week to improve range of motion.\nNeuromotor exercise (functional fitness) should be performed 2-3 days a week. Examples include balance, agility, coordination and gait exercises.\nHow you meet (or exceed) these guidelines is up to you. It’s probably easiest to split your workouts into cardio, 2-3 times a week for flexibility/neuromotor/strengthening 2-3 days a week. You should also include at least one day off each week in your exercise program.\n \nWhere do you start?\nHow often you should exercise depends on where you start exercising. Are you new to exercising? It’s best to ask your healthcare team where you should start exercising. In general, exercising 2-3 times a week can be a good start. Once this is possible, you can add more exercise each week. Remember, your main goal is to do any exercise you can, and it’s better than nothing.\nDon’t be discouraged if you don’t start your exercise program with the recommended amount of exercise. Any exercise is good for health. If you have a specific fitness goal, your weekly workouts may look different. For example, if you’re training for an endurance event, you’ll be doing more cardio than the ACSM recommends. If you’re trying to increase your strength specifically, your focus on strength training may be greater, possibly over half the guidelines.\n \nDo strength training 2-3 times a week\nWhatever your fitness goals, you should incorporate strength training into your workouts. Strength training should include a wide variety of exercises and equipment targeting all major muscle groups. In general, it is recommended to perform 2-4 sets of movements per muscle group with 8-12 repetitions.\nOlder adults or those just starting out should do lower-intensity workouts with sets of 10-15 repetitions. A common misconception about strength training is that you need a gym membership. You can do many strength training exercises with your body weight anywhere. For example, push-ups, squats, sit-ups, and sit-ups are all examples of strength exercises that you can do anywhere.\n \nHow much cardio should you do?\nThe ACSM guidelines of 2.5 hours of moderate exercise per week can be broken down in different ways:\n5 days a week, 30 minutes each time (can be completed in 10 minutes)\n3 days a week, 60 minutes each time (30 minutes above the guideline)\nCombination of moderate to high intensity exercise\nDepending on your goals and your starting point, you need to do how much cardio and what types of exercise. Examples of moderate exercise include: walking, jogging, dancing, gardening, football, etc. Moderate exercise can be sustained without leaving you out of breath. The heart rate increases, but this rate can be maintained for a while.\n \nHow Much Flexibility and Stretching Should You Do?\nExercise recommendations tend to focus on strength training and cardio. However, flexibility and neuromotor exercises should not be forgotten. Flexibility and neuromotor training can easily be combined before or after strength training or cardio.\nFor example: stretching before and after exercise, dynamic warm-ups, yoga, Pilates and balance exercises. Muscles should be warm before doing stretches. Hold the stretch for 10-30 seconds and repeat 2-4 times.\n \nFollow us:\nhttps://lifebuddy.siterubix.com/", "authorship": "human"}

But despite hearing far more English than Italian, it’s still possible to get a little bit of a feel for Florentine culture and history.\n \nEverything was going according to the plan. We had randomly chosen a restaurant, and had enjoyed a nice meal. I went to the restroom to… make room for more wine.\n \nThis restaurant had one door to both men’s and women’s bathrooms, then obviously individual doors for each gender beyond that. (I can’t remember why this made sense, but it did. Maybe there was only one sink in the “antechamber” for both bathrooms?) The exterior door was labelled “bagni” (“bathrooms”) and the interior doors were labeled “donna” and “uomo.” I won’t translate those two exotic terms, for reasons that will be soon be evident. But for now, pause for just a moment and take a guess… a wild conjecture… as to what those two terms mean.\n \nI’ll give you a hint. At the moment I was heading to the bathroom, there was a woman who stood in apparent paralysis inside the “bagni” door, but outside the “uomo” and “donna” doors. A man then emerged from the “uomo” door. The woman remained, utterly confused. She wondered aloud, “which door do I use?”, not necessarily talking \nto\n me, but perhaps hoping I could help.\n \nI did. I directed her to the “donna” door. I can only assume she found the relief she was looking for, as did I inside the “uomo” door.\n \nI came back to my seat and relayed all this to my wife. She was as perplexed as I was, how someone could get so far — to plan a trip to Italy, to get on a plane, to make it from some airport or another all the way to the center of Florence — without somehow picking up a \nlittle\n vocabulary. And even if she literally just woke up magically transported from her home in ‘merica to this restaurant, how she couldn’t put it together that a \nman\n \nwalked out of one of the doors\n.\n \nAs I wrapped up my brief narrative, I saw her emerge from the bathroom and take her seat. Turned out, that seat was right next to us. She then explained, exasperated, the intricate system at play in the restroom to her traveling companion, who I can only assume was her husband.

My friends taught me how to use Facebook, Nimbuzz and YouTube.\n \nI requested my mother to make my father purchase a\nn\n Internet enabled phone. My mother asked about the cost of the same. I told 2–3 thousand for basic keypad and 4–5 thousand for screen touch phone. Firstly my mother refused to help me. But later when I told her that all my friends having internet enabled screen touch phone for study, at least you should talk about basic keypad phone.\n \nMy mother told the same to my father. After 1–2 week later I again asked my mother. My mother any how gave me 5,000 Rupees. I want to ask my mother..but she scold me …not to ask any question. I didn't purchase any phone and put back that money in my mother's wallet. Next day my mother was asking about my phone, I replied …Nhi mummy, main dosto k phone se hi kaam Chala lunga. Mere admission ke liye Kam aa jayenge wo rupye ( \nNo, I can manage with my friend's phone. That money will help me to take admission)\n My mother told …Tu le le..apni cheez apni hoti h..wo kab tak dikhayenge tujhe ( \nYou should buy….)\n \nFinally I got my Nokia 5233 in June 2011. I tried to search all those things what I want to.. earlier.\n \nMy father asked me …what have you thought about your next study. I told my father, I want to take admission in B.Tech. Banks are providing Education Loan easily now a days.\n \nI took admission in a private college which was near to my home because if I take admission far away from my home. It will be more expensive.\n \nTwo of my friends also pursuing b.tech in that college. We all three go to college by one old hero motorcycle and expenses were equally divided.\n \nI never thought about the expenditures except college fee, I used to suffer economically by stationary, books and assignments expenses. I was consuming half of my family income.\n \nI sold my Nokia 5233 which helping me a lot in study especially assignments.\n \nDay by day my family’s economic condition going down.\n \nI started to teach my neighbor's children to earn some money to bear college expenses. (\nGenerally many students came to study at my home in vacation but earlier I didn't charge any amount for that… luckily their parents came to request me to spare some of my time to teach their children in lieu of that they offerred me tuetion fee\ns)\n \nBut it affecting my study…also there is a tension in my mind seeing my family condition. One of my elder sister awaiting to get married.\n \nI think to quit my study and start submitting some forms for government Job. (\nAlso there was a rumour that time , future of b.tech \nis \nnot secure as there are many students wandering after b.tech\n). So I strongly start believing in that.\n \nI appeared in many exam for government Job, many of my classmates also doing same. They think a government peon is far better than a unemployed engineer.\n \nFinally I got a call letter from (don't want to mention organization’s name). My parents want to stop me to join that service but there is one more problem our paternal house divided in four parts and my father got only 25 square foot of land. It was also a necessity to build that part to live. (\nI'm unable to upload pics as I had no camera phone that time)\n \nAlso my younger brother’s basic education has been totally effected by working in fields as my parents \nhas \ngrown old ( we have a small piece of agriculture land and some cattles)\n \nThe sole responsibility to take my family forward was on my shoulder. Seeing no other option I joined that service. Now I am not saying that… I m earning good (what I want) but I am capable to carry all the responsibility of my family. Last year in December my sister got married. My brother completed graduation.\n \nYou will ask when I joined Quora ?\n \nAns : To check..you can go through my profile.

However, a common recommendation is to perform a combination of strength training and cardiovascular exercise.\n \nFor gaining muscle and strength, it is important to prioritize resistance training exercises that target all major muscle groups. This can be achieved through either full-body or split routines.\n \nFull-body routines typically involve performing exercises that target multiple muscle groups in each workout session. This can be a good option for beginners or those with limited time to workout. Sample full-body workout routines may include exercises such as squats, deadlifts, bench press, rows, and overhead press.\n \nSplit routines involve dividing workouts into different muscle groups on different days, typically targeting one or two muscle groups per session. This can be a good option for more advanced lifters or those looking to focus on specific muscle groups. Sample split workout routines may include a push/pull/legs split, where push exercises (e.g. chest, shoulders, triceps) are performed on one day, pull exercises (e.g. back, biceps) on another day, and leg exercises on a separate day.\n \nIn terms of minimizing fat loss, it is important to combine strength training with cardiovascular exercise to create a calorie deficit. Adding in HIIT (high-intensity interval training) or steady-state cardio sessions a few times per week can help to burn additional calories and promote fat loss while maintaining muscle mass.", "authorship": "human"}

I’ve never seen so many pine trees in all my life, rolling endlessly like waves on the ocean across barren mountains.\n \nI was camping near Golden in the summer months, staying at a campsite with a few other travellers. This was when I used to do hitchhiking up the Trans-Canada Highway.\nIn this campsite were a variety of different travellers from across the world. Some were Canadian, a few Australians, there was a German, Spaniard and a couple of Americans.\n \nWe were isolated. Our campsite was deep in the mountains. I saw black bears and all sorts of other mammals. Everyone was naturally curious about black bears, afraid of being mauled to death but also very eager to get a photograph of them.\n \nI remember prepping for hours about how I would react in case a bear approached me, looking for its next meal. I knew how to roll on the ground, stand tall and shout, pop off a firecracker and I read up on how to use bear spray if it came to it.\nNow enters one of the most idiotic individuals I have ever met.\n \nLet’s call him Captain Know-it-All.\nCaptain Know-it-All had lectured us for the last two nights around the campfire about how he was a ‘citizen of the world’ (whatever that means) in one of the thickest Californian accents I’ve encountered. He also told us about the wilderness as if he were a pioneer explorer.\n \nCaptain Know-it-All seemed to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of the outdoors, especially wilderness survival. Yet he was very gaunt and seemed to have only left his daily outing to the coffee shop for the first time on this trip. He was very slim, lanky, tall like a giraffe with long hair and a drawn out face.\n \nWe were all developing headaches as he tried to impress us. His Romanian girlfriend only encouraged him on, inflating his ego to mountainous proportions.\nAround his waist at all times was a tool belt containing every piece of kit you can think, including a small hatchet that was impossible to cut anything with and a strange admixture of blunt instruments except for a sharp hunter’s knife which was far too dangerous for this person to carry.\n \nHe also had fire starters dangling from the belt, a compass in case he strayed ten metres from his car, and all manners of other rubbish he was never going to use. The only thing this absurd tool belt was going to do was weigh him down when a bear’s stomach grumbled. However, out of all these tools, Captain Know-it-All’s most prized possession was a canister of bear-spray.\nI was actually told by an expert wilderness survivalist who lived alone in the Canadian mountains to not carry bear spray with me when hiking. I thought this was counterintuitive, but he explained that many of the people who try to use it have absolutely no idea how to safely discharge a canister.\n \nProblems include not only being unable to aim at a fast moving bear charging towards you, but missing the target, not opening it fast enough or misjudging wind direction. You can’t just fire glorified pepper spray into strong winds and \nnot\n be throughly coated in eye-burning liquids. This expert judged that those with little experience are more likely to hurt themselves with bear spray than have any successful chance of hurting the bear.\n \nThe best tips for a black bear encounter are not to run away, but to make yourself big by waving both arms and creating loud noises. This will scare off black bears most of the time rather than blinding yourself with bear spray and potentially aggravating a black bear with the spray.\nNow back to Captain Know-it-All.\n \nThis ‘citizen of the world’ (who was very eager to apologise for being American) was packing his belongings for a day of hiking with his Romanian girlfriend. In the boot of their car, they were arranging everything for the hike as if they were trekking to the Grand Canyon and back.\n \nOf course, as they both fiddled with the bear spray, they somehow managed to spray each other in the face and eyes whilst knee deep in the boot of their car.\nSafe to say, they didn’t go hiking that day.", "authorship": "human"}

I asked her where that came from and it turned out that she assumed Serbs were Muslims. \nApparently, she wanted to ask me that ever since I had sent her a photo of myself “with no turban on my head”.\nThis did not happen to me, but it still counts. A friend from Paris went to Bilbao for a short vacation and she met some American tourists who tried to chat her up, over her T-shirt with JAPAN written on it. One of them asked her if she was particular to Japan because “it’s right next to France”.\nPlease, note that I have many American friends who are super-educated and that each country has a lot of dumb and ignorant people.

It works those muscles explosively and in a natural, athletic fashion. It builds explosive strength from the floor, squat strength and quick hip flexion.\n \nTWO\n \nPush press has been showed to produce more rate of force development in the legs than squats or even cleans do. A shorts rom, but enough to give you power to jumpe, sprint etc (which is a short rom too if you break it down). With heavy weights over your head, everything under (back, core, glutes and ofc shoulders girdle) it has to stabilise it, like pillars holding a roof. It devolops massive triceps and delts, even traps and CHEST. Yes. The entire upper body except biceps and. Unlike chest presses, overhead presses develops the delt much much better, and works the meatiest part of the tricep more. You will have a more round chest (less down-heavy like benchers) and wider, rounder delts. Also produces less injury than benching due to more balansed development (and you can actually drop it on the floor, unlike a bench press..). The weight will be heavy AF on the way down since you used legs to get it up. Humans are stronger on exentric reps, and this exercise is actually HEAVIER for that part, which is unique. It may allow you to hold weights close to your max bench OVERHEAD and standing up. Possibly the #1 exercise of all time.\n \nTHREE\n \nWeighted chins will develop the muscles that have already been hit, but not hammered. 2/3 of your torso muscles (or more) will be crushed. Biceps, forearms, lats, rhomboids, rear delts (which compensates for the push press), lower and middle traps, abs and even a bit of upper chest (according to studies). Can be done very heavy.\n \nIf you get to a 1.5x weight on all these exercises (on chins that means adding 50% of your own bw) for a few reps, you will not have any imbalance. Unlike squat bench and dead, these exercise includes explosive training. They will also give you better delts and traps and a more “masculine”chest. You will be more athletic with those, and more balanced. Squat bench dead has no upper body pulling to work biceps and rear delts, and the bench almost exclusively works the front part. Bad. Another benefit is that squats and deads have higher injury risk, but explosive movements with a moderate weight might build the same size without overloading soft tissue.\n \nPlease let me know what you think", "authorship": "human"}

You see when we mentally challenged folks are on medication it makes our thinking like molasses finding clarity through thick mud. It is so hard to think when I am on bad drugs.\n \nSo yes, I’ve held many of these jobs that at bad times in my life render me incapable of them. Please do not blame me. Perhaps blame the fact that besides me being on medication that makes it nearly impossible for me to think but also that machines teach us not to think for ourselves. In pressing in buttons our thinking abilities are rendered inactive thus eventually become muted over time.\n \nTechnology is rendering us low skilled laborers out of the job market. Its scary and frightening for a whole bunch of people like me who do not have access to education or the ability to think on a level demanding a living wage. Us poor people bear the brunt of blame for our inability to rise out of insurmountable odds against us. We attend elementary schools where the Kindergarten children run around slurring hate speech at the others so the chance for us to learn our ABCs does not arrive. Yet our schools push us onto the first grade ill equipped to handle the challenges that face us there because we never got the ingredients of a calm classroom education.\n \nNot only that our parents are in marriages that make our home environment chaotic too. Our parents if both home at the same yell at each other and bicker about money and sex and bargain on how much our father will pay our mother to feed us kids so we can eat that week for how many times she will sleep with him for that money….A little too much information? Perhaps. Keep reading.\n \nThe challenges that face us poor people render us in these positions in life where we are utterly helpless dependent on others because we never learn the tools on how to escape these situations. We get told to have them. But no one ever teaches how to get out of these bad situations even when we do earn the ability for education because others heap other insurmountable odds onto our plates like illness and physical disability rendering us then unable to attend universities like our peers sail through leading them to jobs that you reading this I imagine perhaps have.\n \nIts easy not to see poor people. We are everywhere. We are the checkers at 7-Eleven whose parents did not speak English so we went into Kindergarten not equipped with the language skills our English speaking peers have. It is little wonder when we get passed on through education that our deficiencies don’t measure up to other peers. It is not a fair game we play in life and so when I hear others tell each other how ignorant we can be, I get saddened at the lack of insight that person gives to the checker like me who can’t do simple math. I’ve been a checker. I am a college graduate. I have been a checker after my college graduation. I have been many more things and many less things in my life but ignorant I don’t think is one I am most proud of. So next time we all see a person who can’t do simple math try to think about what that kid’s childhood has been like leading to him or her not being able to count back from $100. It should not insight a superior mentality. It should insight gratitude for the privilege some of us get to attend elementary schools where the kids don’t fight forcing a teacher into behavior management rather than educational inspirer extraordinaire.

It isn't as tiring or grueling on your joints as it is when you're doing runs on varied, uneven, and realistic terrain.\n \nI liked going to the gym and rotating between lifting machines like the bicep curl, tricep press, and tricep pushdown when I wanted to blow off steam; but the muscle soreness and stiffness that I got in the inboard side of my elbow (known as the medial epicondyle) was excruciating every time I tried to straighten my arm a day after the workout.\n \nAs a result, I'd have to go to work the next day with my arms squared off in a stiff, rigid, and 45-degree angle. My arms being bent at the elbow and unable to extend without causing agony. People thought I was playing around, “Look at this dick walking around trying to make chicken sandwiches with his robot arms.”\n \nSo cardio became my go to. Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December, and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\n \n(Upvote for the Edgar Allan Poe reference? )\n \nI went to exercise at L.A Fitness with a gym rat who practically snorted canisters of preworkout and whey protein. And he had a free guest pass, so I said what the hell. I got the heart, kid! I was always at the disadvantage, but I doggedly followed his workout routine despite feeling I was over training my muscles.\n \nThe days that we were too worn out or didn't have enough time to go through with a full workout, we treated them as cardio days. Immediately, I fell in love with the treadmill.\n \nThe way Mr.Protein saw it, it was either go home with your mind carrying your agonized and hypertrophic corpse in a body bag, or do cardio until you dropped.\n \nSo I grew fond of working to a beat, treading on the elastic band that bounced with a slight resistance as it looped under my feet, and seeing the gorgeous female triathletes who seemed to have unparalleled stamina run alongside me.\n \nI'd start off getting started at a slow and steady 3.5 MPH and would gradually increase the speed by .2 every minute. Often, I'd swap my playlist to an upbeat and fast BPM playlist to challange myself to what I deemed a speed round.\n \nRaised the incline, raised the speed to 6.0 MPH, and raised the resistance. And every twenty seconds, I'd increase the speed by .20\n \nBefore all this, I was always confused as to why people enjoyed running track or doing seemingly linear sports ike cross-country. But then I tried it for myself in the comfort of a warm gym. It feels like you're running away from it all. Not in a bad way. It feels a bit like you're the last mazerunner burdened with dashing through the labrynth-complex that is life.\n \nThere's a controlled rhythm and willpower, and most of the time you'll be too focused on keeping your lungs supplied with oxygen for you to think about much else. It's a fascinating workout all-in-all.\n \nCheers,\n \nDaniel.\n \nSources :\n \nGolfer's elbow - Symptoms and causes", "authorship": "human"}

There are two i can honestly say that i was absolutley so lucky to have met them. However, there have been a few i have disliked. The most recent one was very full of both himself and his country. Now, i have no issue with loving your country, hell, i love Britain. But, the issue with this guy is that he would repeatedly mention the independence war and how britain ‘lost’ against them. Once, i can deal with that, but everytime he spoke he would bring it up. He’d always say that “britain used to be ruling over so many colonies and now look” or “if britain ever had the chance i bet they would try and rule the world but fail. However, if america wanted to rule the world they could.” Like, excuse me, i wanted to ask how your days was or hang out and have a friendly chat but no. Your bringing up past wars and trashing other countries such as germany, asian countries, the whole lot. I remember he would always say nasty things towards the french saying that they “suck so bad” and that “britain must suck more because they lost to france”. I heard the ‘brits are coming’ repeatedly. I just wanted to have fun but clearly this guy was the sort to only value his opinion and shut out/but in everyone elses if they disagree.\n \nAt one time, we were speaking over the phone and playing games.\n \nI have never wanted to punch a prick so much. I was speaking to my younger brother whilst he started playing this loud video over the phone, i had to lower the volume considerably because it was some guy spouting nonsense about america being the greatest etc. After he realised i wasn’t paying attention to the video he started playing it a second time. I ignored him again and he asked “did you hear that?” and i replied “no, it was too loud and i was speaking to my brother so i turned you all the way down.” he got quite agitated at that. If verbally abusing other countries wasn’t enough, he also started being sexist, racist and harshly talking to me about anyone who wasn’t straight such as “f****** lesbians” as he put it. I told him to stop, i didn’t like what he was saying one bit. He told me to calm down and that he was only ‘joking’. Im sorry, but everything that came out of his mouth was not funny at all. At the time i had another american friend from texas, he was a great laugh and would say offensive things but to me they were funny. He’d commonly say ‘filthy brit’ and id quickly reply with ‘filthy american’. There was definately a difference between the two. Even my younger brother, who had never spoke to him (only heard him) was sick of the nasty american.\n \nIts one thing to be patriotic but to verbally abuse every other country, race or sexuality is another. I had had enough, so i stopped replying/speaking to him. I just wanted to have some fun and a nice chat, but instead i got an earful of how shit my country is as well as other countries and absolutely terrible things to do with race, gender, sex and women\n \nI felt mean ignoring him but he was not the kind of person i wanted to be friends with…", "authorship": "human"}

Sandwiches are one of the best things ever, right? They’re quick, easy, and you can pack them with all kinds of delicious and nutritious ingredients. But what’s the \nbest\n sandwich ingredient? Well, that depends on what you’re looking for—flavor, health, or just pure yumminess. Instead of writing about my favorite ingredients, I shared detailed information about sandwiches so you can decide what you want to include in your own creation. Let’s dive into some top picks for building the ultimate sandwich!\n1. The Protein Powerhouse\n \nEvery great sandwich needs a good protein. Protein keeps you full and helps build and repair your muscles. Here are some all-star options:\nGrilled Chicken or Turkey:\n Lean and flavorful, these options are perfect for a light, healthy sandwich. Add some mustard or avocado for extra zing!\nEggs:\n Hard-boiled or scrambled, eggs are a classic. They’re rich in protein and vitamins, and they go well with almost anything.\nPlant-Based Proteins:\n For veggie lovers, try hummus, tempeh, or even smashed chickpeas. These options are not just healthy but also super satisfying.\n2. The Creamy Spread\n \nNo sandwich is complete without a spread to tie everything together. Choose something that adds flavor without piling on empty calories:\nAvocado:\n Creamy, delicious, and full of healthy fats. It’s a great substitute for butter or mayo. Mash it up with a little salt and pepper for a spread you’ll love.\nHummus:\n A fantastic plant-based option that’s rich in protein and fiber. It comes in different flavors, so you can mix things up—roasted red pepper, garlic, or plain.\nGreek Yogurt Spread:\n Mix plain Greek yogurt with herbs and spices for a tangy, creamy spread. It’s lower in fat than mayo and tastes amazing.\n3. The Crunch Factor\n \nYou can’t skip the crunch! It’s the texture that makes every bite exciting. Here are some ideas to keep things interesting:\nLeafy Greens:\n Romaine lettuce, spinach, or arugula adds freshness and a satisfying crunch. Plus, they’re packed with vitamins and antioxidants.\nThinly Sliced Veggies:\n Cucumber, bell peppers, and carrots are perfect for adding crunch and color. Bonus: they’re super hydrating and low in calories.\nPickles:\n For a tangy twist, add pickles or banana peppers. They give your sandwich a zesty kick!\n4. The Cheesy Touch\n \nIf you’re a cheese lover, this is your time to shine. A little cheese goes a long way to add creaminess and flavor:\nSliced Cheddar or Swiss:\n Classic choices that melt beautifully if you’re making a toasted sandwich.\nFeta or Goat Cheese:\n These crumbly cheeses add a tangy, gourmet vibe to your sandwich.\nVegan Cheese:\n There are great plant-based cheese options out there if you’re avoiding dairy.\n5. The Secret Ingredient\n \nEvery sandwich needs that one thing that takes it to the next level. Here are some game-changers:\nPesto:\n Spread a thin layer of pesto for a burst of herby flavor. It’s especially great with chicken or roasted veggies.\nSriracha or Hot Sauce:\n Add a little heat to wake up your taste buds. Just a drizzle will do!\nFruits:\n Yes, fruits! Sliced apples, pears, or even dried cranberries can add a sweet contrast to savory ingredients.\nHow to Build the Perfect Sandwich\n \nNow that you’ve got all these amazing ingredients to choose from, here’s how to put it all together:\nStart with a base: whole-grain bread, a wrap, or even a lettuce leaf for a low-carb option.\nAdd your protein: pick your favorite meat, eggs, or plant-based protein.\nLayer on the veggies: the more color, the better!\nSpread it out: choose a healthy spread like hummus or avocado.\nFinish strong: sprinkle on cheese, nuts, or that secret ingredient to make it truly yours.\nThe Bottom Line\n \nThe best sandwich ingredient is the one that makes you excited to eat your meal! Whether you’re in the mood for creamy avocado, crunchy veggies, or flavorful pesto, there are so many ways to create a healthy, delicious sandwich that’s totally your style.\n \nSo go ahead, get creative, and build a sandwich that’s not just a meal—it’s an experience.

I’m a poor guy as far as my financial situation is concerned not with my Attitude or Goals.\n \nMy name is SURESH, I come from a very poor family background with Big Dreams. We used to live in a small village with a monthly income of Rs. 6,000.\n \nMy mother who is a tailor who is the only source of our family, she sacrificed her life for the benefit of our family development but things are not going as she used to think. I don’t want to talk about my father, though physically he is there, he is not contributing to our family in any way rather he used to torture my mother every time. He is completely addicted to alcohol. I had a younger brother who is completely deaf and dumb, this has become one more challenging task for our family.\n \nAs we are not financially capable, no one used to support us, including our relatives. I can’t explain my pain within crispy words. Nowadays, the so-called Vitamin M (money) is the only criteria for anything, you may accept it or you may not accept it.\n \nI’ve written IAS examination 3 times in a row but failed to clear it. Twice, I had my mains. But no result. As I’m zero at maths, I was not in a position to take any other bank or SSC examination.\n \nDay and night struggles, I’ve had my tears. Things were changed at my home, mother and brother got hospitalized. My father is not caring anything about our family. I came back I’ve taken care of my family.\n \nFailure and Impact :\n \nEverybody is used to point me, they used to show me as a symbol of failure. I may failed in my IAS examination but I’m not going to fail in my life. I’m a fighter, though I failed in civil services, I learned a lot from the journey. How can a single sheet of examination paper can decide my future? Everybody is Unique, right?\n \nNo contacts. No relationships. No money.\n \nApproaching the Politicians :\n \nAs I’ve had immense knowledge as far as administration and policy making is concern, I approached few politicians to work as an assistant to them. But got rejected everywhere.\n \nCivil Services Mission:\n \nI don’t want to mention the institution name but I found it. Things were going on my way. But here comes challenge again, I need to pay Rs.60,000 for my coaching. I had no idea how to pay.\n \nThanks for the Internet. I used to search on the Google for helping hands to support me, actually I’ve sent more than 2500 emails to different NGOs and trusts all over the India, including few persons individually whom I found on Google.\n \nI got few positive responses. Fortunately, I got support from them to continue my preparation. I paid the fee and I started working on my mission.\n \nPart Time Jobs :\n \nI worked in different part time jobs to survive myself. KFC, Big Bazaar, As a Counsellor etc…\n \nStruggles and Sorrows:\n \nI had only three pairs of dresses. If I want to go for coaching I’ve to wear the one dress for two to three days. I did all the Hard Work can do. My only ambition is to get into the civil services. No other exams.\n \nAiming :\n \nSo, I aimed big to wage a war against my poverty, I decided to become a Civil Servant, so that I’ll get recognition and fame. At that time, I thought, education was the only solution for me.\n \nMy Journey :\n \nI had no money to go and stay in Hyderabad. So, I’ve written Osmania University Entrance examination for my post graduation on the advice of my English Lecturer, actually my plan is to get shelter and then prepare for my IAS examination. By God’s grace everything went very well. I got good rank and I joined there for my post graduation. (For my preparation only)\n \nAshok Nagar, Hyderabad:\n \nI’ve no idea about the civil services examination, so I decided to go for coaching. I’ve had my search for the best coaching institution in Hyderabad, where thousands and lakhs of people are roaming around the Ashok Nagar cross roads in the name of IAS coaching. Actually, it is more than a business and business of business. I’m not in a position to cope up with big institutions where the crowd is so high. Then, I decided to choose the institution with minimum strength\n \nEntrepreneurial Journey :\n \nFormal education will make you a living but Self-education will make you a Fortune. As the start-up revolution is going in India, I had a question in my mind – why don’t I start myself as an entrepreneur?\n \nList of my failures :\n \nCivil Services Examination 1st attempt failure\n \nGroup 1 Examination Failure\n \nCivil Services Examination 2nd attempt failure (cleared mains, failed in personality test)\n \nCivil Services Examination 3rd attempt failure\n \nOne Indian Student, Failed to complete the book\n \nSipCup advertising company Failed\n \nWe Adopt foundation failed due to lack of funds.\n \nFailed to establish myself as a Personal Assistant to A Politician.\n \nMarriage-Money: Realities:\n \nAs a part of my Journey, I approached few marriage bureaus and even I advertised myself on the Shaadi matrimony, looking for some girl or family who can invest and ready to fuel & fulfil my dreams by supporting through money to establish my dream company.\n \nI've approached few, even if the girl is divorced, I'm okay with second match, if she had no kids.\n \n😂😹 My madness, the world has no place for Honesty & Loyalty, Money only matters.\n \nApproached few, divorced & 3 are elder to me around 32 & 34 ages. Their response: We don't care about story, all we need someone who can take care our luxury needs. That's all.\n \nI've approached friends & family members, who never believed in my vision, no support.\n \nI've approached my community people, leaders & some of the richest people in my community, no support.\n \nI've approached few IAS officers, Commisisoners, NRIs & Politicians, no support.\n \nTrying my level best to reach angel investors & venture capitalist via LinkedIn & every other platform, no responses are coming.\n \nI gave all my side but it didn’t gave me nothing beside. I gave all my efforts and it gave me nothing as a report. Of course success will hug in private and failure will slap in public. But neither happened to me.\n \nI tried… cried… dried… all myself !!!8\n \nNow???\n \nNow, I’m no longer in a position to write any examination or no longer want to work under someone. I want to become a self-made entrepreneur in any way. I’m not going to give up on my dreams.\n \n“If the plan is not working, change the plan but not the Goals”.\n \n“Body has it’s limitations but mind doesn’t “\n \nYour Help is Needed :\n \nI'm just trying to express my experiences to get some assistance from the Quora community,if possible.\n \nI would love to welcome your suggestions or advices or help or criticism in any way.\n \nI may not be the perfect guy to answer you but I can feel and express my opinion by stepping into your shoes in a perfect way.\n \nI’m not giving up rather I’m challenging myself to get what I want. I’ll persist until I succeed. For me, the true happiness always lies in Fighting.\n \nDisclaimer:\n \nAll these are based on my personal experiences only.\n \nI’m not promoting or marketing myself as a good person\n \nAbsolutely, I can openly say 97.75% I’m not a good guy\n \nI’m not a perfect guy, I’ll never. My Life is always under construction with your help, mostly with your criticism.\n \nI may not be the perfect guy to answer you or advice you but I can feel and express my feelings by stepping into your shoes in a perfect way in my own way. Please do correct me if I’m wrong because I’m not perfect. I’d love to welcome your criticism rather appreciations because it really helps to move forward with Growth and Development in every aspect of my Life.\n \nNow, I’m running and looking forward to find some investment and cofounder as well for my Brand Boss Media, an Influencer marketing agency.\n \n#Never Give Up#\n \n#Stay Hungry, Stay Crazy#\n \nThanks For Being Awesome With Your Thoughts And Wisdom With Words,\n \nSURESH MADHA !!!", "authorship": "human"}

Don't lock out the elbows; keep them slightly bent. Extend your legs back so you are balanced on your hands and toes, your feet hip-width apart. Once in this position, here is how you will do a push-up.\nContract your abs and tighten your core by pulling your belly button toward your spine.\nInhale as you slowly bend your elbows and lower yourself to the floor, until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle.\nExhale while contracting your chest muscles and pushing back up through your hands, returning to the start position.\n2. Glute Bridge\n \nA glute bridge is an exercise that can be used to target the gluteal muscles. It is often seen in warm up segments or strength/accessory training segments to increase glute activation, strength, and muscle hypertrophy.\n \nHow To Do It:\nLie face up on the floor, with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground. Keep your arms at your side with your palms down.\nLift your hips off the ground until your knees, hips and shoulders form a straight line. Squeeze those glutes hard and keep your abs drawn in so you don’t overextend your back during the exercise.\nHold your bridged position for a couple of seconds before easing back down.\n3. Toe-touch\n \nStrengthen your abdominal muscles with an exercise that combines the toe touch and the crunch and is sometimes referred to as the toe-touch crunch, or the vertical toe touch.The toe touching ab exercise primarily trains your rectus abdominis -- the muscle that makes up your six-pack. Your core, however, includes your side obliques, transverse abdominis, back stabilizers and pelvic floor.\n \nHow To Do It:\nLie on your back with your palms down by your sides. Bend your knees and bring them toward your torso, then slowly start to straighten your legs. They should ultimately end up perpendicular to the ground.\nLift your arms. While exhaling, slowly roll your shoulders up off the mat, reaching towards your toes. Round your shoulders forward (but keep them down) to create a concave shape with your torso. Your lower back should stay on the ground, but don’t press it into the floor — that’ll flatten the natural curve of your lower back and take you out of the correct position.\nInhale as you lower back down. When you reach the ground, keep the tension in your abs firing. In other words, don’t just relax on the mat.

I also try hard not to make assumptions about what people SHOULD know. Different people know different things because they live in different circumstances, have different needs and desires, and so they pay attention to different things.\n \nI was at an antique steam tractor show in Minnesota once. They also had a lot of regular tractors too. I’d bet you most of the people there would fail a geography test. But they could take a broken tractor apart, fix the problem, put it back together, and it would run just fine. That is something MOST people in this world could not do. So who, in this example, should be called ignorant? In my book the people who feed us can be forgiven for the state of their knowledge of geography as long as they keep those tractors running.\n \nOn the other hand there IS appalling ignorance around. Part of it is our failure to properly educate our children in any number of ways. I have a cousin who lives in a nearby town. Her children were not taught anything about World War Two “because it might upset them.” And we pass failing kids on to the next grade anyway so that we don’t damage their self-esteem, thus teaching them that they don’t have to learn. Or if a kid is disruptive a teacher cannot just haul him down to the principal’s office any more; the teacher has to call the intervention team while the kid rages on. In my daughter’s high school chemistry class they never once used actual chemicals; it was all “book learnin”.\n \nI live in Massachusetts in a town reputed to have a very good public school system. One day I went to a grocery store here in my town, grabbed a pair of 99 cent food items which were not taxable so I would pay $1.98 total. The checkout girl was a kid wearing a sweatshirt from the local high school. Anyway I had 98 cents in change so I pulled out a dollar bill and handed it and the 98 cents to her before she told me what I owed. She looked at me incredulously and said, “How did you do that?” What? “How did I do what,” I asked in response? “How did you know how much it would be,” she answered. I honestly don’t remember what I replied, if anything. I wonder how much self esteem she had.\n \nPeople are also ignorant because of TV, the movies, and now the Internet. They use up LOTS of time, time which might otherwise go to learning. And people believe what they see on TV, YouTube, etc, as if it were fact. DIS-education by the Media is very hard in particular on people’s knowledge of science and on critical thinking. I wonder how any of our children ever become engineers or scientists. I can’t even think where to begin on this one…. \n“OMG, radiation from Fukushima has been detected in California. Throw those strawberries in the trash at once!” Inoculations cause autism. Nuclear reactors run as long as the heater is turned on\n …. The good news with these people is that if you sit them down and explain things to them one on one then they will learn, ie ignorance in such people can be overcome with education. But ignorance takes a huge toll because it leads to bad political decisions which affect all of us and the future of our nation and the world. Global Warming, anyone?\n \nLet us not forget those other great forms of entertainment, drugs and alcohol. I am a recovering alcoholic myself. I am fortunate that I did not start drinking until I was out of college. However I hear lots and lots of people at AA meetings who did start drinking and drugging in school, even in elementary school. Their education mostly just stopped. And speaking of ignorance, we didn’t learn anything from the very failed experiment of Prohibition; the “War on Drugs” just goes on and on…..\n \nWe are also becoming a nation of believers. I am not JUST talking about bible thumpers. Believers go beyond merely ignorant. I am talking about people who \nbelieve\n that something is true and reject all evidence contrary to their belief. Bible thumpers, of course, reject the theory of evolution which they try to have not taught in our schools. But the political left also has its beliefs. For instance, a history book my daughter was given said that the Cultural Revolution in China, one of the greatest slaughters in human history, “caused a lot of suicides”. And how about the university researcher who studied human intelligence and published a paper stating that intelligence is mostly genetic. Other staff members at that institution tried to have him fired. Those kinds of belief-driven values perpetuate ignorance because such people simply refuse to let knowledge in, and they go out of their way to spread their demonstrably false beliefs to others. Or fire people they disagree with. Oh let us not forget the flat-earth and “Nibiru” people either. They are also among the proselytizers of ignorance.\n \nOne final mention since I am married to a teacher. The government keeps interfering with education. I won’t comment on the pros and cons of policies which come down upon teachers from on high, but whether good or bad two facts are inescapable: Complying with all those requirements takes more and more of our teacher’s time, and therefore teachers have less and less time to teach, and what is studied becomes narrower and narrower, clearly a cause of massive ignorance.\n \nSorry for the rant, but there are reasons for the ignorance in this country. We are pretty ignorant about how we raise our children, and ignorance begets ignorance.\nADDENDUM: I want to add Trump supporters to my list of the most ignorant Americans. The more ardent the supporters the more [intentionally] ignorant they have to be to overlook Trump’s criminal behavior, especially the lethally ignorant choices Trump made regarding his COVID-19 “policy”. As of today, 5/20/2021, we are approaching 600,000 Americans dead thanks to Trump. His supporters’ refusals to be vaccinated or to even believe that COVID-19 is real (\n*\n) can only push up the number of dead by becoming infected themselves and by spreading the virus to others too.\n \n*\n I actually heard a Trump supporter say that there was no such thing as COVID-19 when I stopped at a convenience store while I traveled west across the US by car just before the 2020 election.
