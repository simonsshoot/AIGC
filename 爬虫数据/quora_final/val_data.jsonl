The exact words said might be slightly off since it’s been about 8 or 9 years now.\n \nIn college, I took a class on the history of prostitution. It was an intense debate-style class. Graduate level (I was an undergraduate.)\n \nAt the end of the quarter, our professor invited us to her place for a class picnic. Since her area of research was communism in Vietnam, she marked the picnic spot with a communist flag tied to a large shrub in the front of her housing complex. It was pretty easy to drive past her place as it was right next to a freeway exit and kind of tucked away. Something large and striking was definitely necessary, and all of her students would have realized that it was hers immediately. In fact, I remember a few of us chuckling over it upon arriving. Make a mental note of that. The flag was being used to mark our picnic spot and was on the housing complex’s property that was facing the street.\n \nThe picnic went pretty smoothly. We had fun. We ate, we talked, we relaxed. Most of the people had left, but about 7 or 8 of us remained.\n \nSuddenly we heard some violent cracking, and turned around to see someone pulling the flag off the shrub. I asked my professor if she wanted me to fetch it and a few of us ran down to retrieve it from the middle-aged lady who was angrily pulling branches off the flag.\n \nWe politely asked her for the flag back, mentioning that it was our professor’s.\n \nHer response was, “YOU CAN’T FLY THIS FLAG IN AMERICA.”\n \nOur eyes widened. This is, of course, untrue and we knew it. We asked for the flag back again, calmly and politely. By this time our professor and a few others came down to try and get the flag back.\n \n“YOU CAN’T FLY THIS FLAG IN AMERICA! IF YOU’RE GOING TO FLY THIS FLAG IN AMERICA, YOU’VE GOTTA FLY THE AMERICAN FLAG ABOVE IT!”\n \nHoo boy. Our professor calmly told the lady why the flag was there and asked for it back. I should mention that the capslock is entirely warranted. She was yelling at us the entire time.\n \n“MY DADDY DIDN’T FIGHT IN IWO JIMA SO YOU COULD FLY THIS FLAG IN AMERICA.”\n \nI’m sorry…what? We were all history buffs, if not history majors, so we all knew that the battle of Iwo Jima had very little to do communism.\n \n“MY GRANDFATHER BUILT THIS HOUSE.” (She pointed to the house behind her, which was next to the housing complex my professor lived in. What any of this had to do with her grandfather or the house, we had no idea.) “YOU CAN’T FLY THE RUSSIAN COMMUNIST FLAG IN AMERICA.”\n \nMy professor switched tacks. “That’s actually not the Soviet Communist flag. It’s-”\n \n“YOU CAN’T FLY A CHINESE COMMUNIST FLAG IN AMERICA. MY DADDY AND HIS BROTHERS DIDN’T FIGHT IN IWO JIMA SO YOU COULD FLY THIS FLAG HERE.”\n \n“It’s not the Chinese Communist flag.”\n \n“THEN WHAT IS IT?”\n \n“It’s the International Communist Party flag. Could I please have my property back, ma’am?”\n \n“NO! I’M GOING TO RIP YOUR FLAG UP AND PUT IT IN THE TRASH!”\n \nWith this she storms off, leaving her slightly horrified husband/partner/relative/whoever he was standing there holding a bag of groceries. He apologized. My professor told him again that we were just using it to mark our picnic spot and she really just wanted it back. He promised to get it back to her.\n \nWe students were just kind of dazed. I think a few of us exchanged shocked glances and statements of disbelief like “What does Iwo Jima have to do with this??? World War II wasn’t really about fighting communism???” (Well, kind of…)\n \nThen, suddenly, the lady re-emerged carrying a very large American flag on a pole, started waving it around and declared to us:\n \n“THIS IS THE ONLY FLAG THAT SHOULD BE FLYING IN AMERICA. IF YOU’RE GOING TO FLY A COMMUNIST FLAG, YOU BETTER FLY THIS FLAG ABOVE IT!”\n \nOh lordy.\n \nIf I recall correctly, at this point she went back to ranting more about World War II, how much she hated communists, and her relatives who fought in whatever wars. But we were done. The professor said a few words to the man about getting her flag back and we retreated back to our picnic where we tried to process whatever the hell that was.\n \nThat woman gets my vote for the most ignorant person I’ve ever met in America.\n \nI didn’t really expect her to know the difference between the International Communist Party flag or the Russian Communist flag, but like many folks of her type she didn’t seem to understand the basic definition of free speech. We had every right to fly that flag, whether we were actually communists or just using to mark our picnic. Nor is there is a stipulation that we fly an American flag above it.\n \nOh, and the American fighting in the Pacific Theater in World War II didn’t have a whole lot to do with communism. Her father was fighting the Japanese Imperialists, and the Japanese Imperialists were just as anti-communist as we were/are.\n \nEdit/Note for future commenters: A lot of folks have already mentioned flying the Nazi flag as a comparison to what my professor did by flying a communist flag. You don’t really need to mention it again. Besides, I disagree that a communist flag provokes the same sort of offense and feeling that a Nazi flag does. Perhaps this is heavy bias on my part considering my personal family history. And now you know why I kind of wish you’d stop bringing up the Nazi flag all the time.\n \nA lot of folks have also made the argument that I would get equally mad upon seeing an offensive flag flying in my neighborhood. Well, actually I do have an offensive flag flying in my neighborhood (a Confederate flag) and I do nothing about it. I’d love to get the owner to take it down, but there’s very few ways to do that without starting a fight or making him want to keep displaying it. It’s awful, and I think it’s a terrible thing for the kids in our neighborhood to have to view everyday, especially the kids of color who live really close by.", "authorship": "human"}

A group of boys entered and were conversing loudly amongst themselves. The topic they were discussing was their experiences dealing with the foreign exchange students they were hosting. One in particular was boasting how the English students had never tried Mexican cuisine before so in order to introduce them, they took them to Taco Bell…. At hearing this I started cursing under my breath in Spanish which brought my presence to their attention.\n \n“Oh, you're like Mexican right? Do you have any good hard shell taco brands you can recommend? My mom wants to cook them a taco casserole.”\n \nI blinked slowly and counted in my head.\n \n“Hard taco shells are not considered Mexican, they are Tex Mex and no it is not the same thing. Buy white corn tortillas if you want to expose them to Mexican food”\n \nI brought them the next day a jar of my mom’s salsa. They told me it was too spicy for them but that it was good.\n \nUpdate:\n \nI forgot one more story possibly because it was so embarrassing I tried to block it.\n \nI took a swimming class in high school instead of taking regular PE. I grew up taking swimming lessons year round so changing in the locker room without a towel wrapped around me for modesty never occurred to me to do since we were all girls there. As I was pulling my swimsuit over my chest I felt hands grasp my arms and was twisted to face a classmate. She kept staring at my chest, freaking me out. She starts yelling “OMG your nipples are brown!!! I didn't know there were brown nipples! Why aren't your nipples pink? Did you burn them?”\n \nThis of course brought forth other white girls who wanted to continue to ogle in amazement in nipples of another color.\n \nYou would've thought that after that I would have changed with a towel wrapped around me but I only had 15 min to dry myself, change and run to the other side of the building for my next class and keeping the towel around you while you try to shimmy with wet legs into skinny jeans is too much of a hassle.

My wife just reminded me of the nice older American couple we met this year in Mexico that didn't know there were any currencies in the world beyond the American dollar and Mexican peso.

For example, I once took a Business Cultures class in Berlin where all the students were Americans, except for me, and none of them knew what the highest mountain in the United States’ was, except for me, a Mexican. I acknowledge this reply could be interpreted as a generalization, which I think it is, because most of the smartest, decent and dedicated people I know are from the U.S., but I do think ignorance is one of the main reasons why a clown is currently working in the Oval Office.

I’m a poor guy as far as my financial situation is concerned not with my attitude or dreams.\n \nI come from a very poor family background with Big Dreams. We used to live in a small village with a monthly income of Rs. 6,000.

I don’t want to talk about my father, though physically he is there, he is not contributing to our family in any way rather he used to torture my mother every time. He is completely addicted to alcohol. I had a younger brother who is completely deaf and dumb, this has become one more challenging task for our family. As we are not financially capable, no one used to support us, including our relatives. I can’t explain my pain within crispy words. Nowadays, the so-called Vitamin M (money) is the only criteria for anything, you may accept it or you may not accept it.\n \nAiming :\n \nSo, I aimed big to wage a war against my poverty, I decided to become a Civil Servant, so that I’ll get recognition and fame. At that time, I thought, education was the only solution for me.\n \nMy Journey :\n \nI had no money to go and stay in Hyderabad. So, I’ve written Osmania University Entrance examination for my post graduation on the advice of my English Lecturer, actually my plan is to get shelter and then prepare for my IAS examination. By God’s grace everything went very well. I got good rank and I joined there for my post graduation. (For my preparation only)\n \nAshok Nagar, Hyderabad :\n \nI’ve no idea about the civil services examination, so I decided to go for coaching. I’ve had my search for the best coaching institution in Hyderabad, where thousands and lakhs of people are roaming around the Ashok Nagar cross roads in the name of IAS coaching. Actually, it is more than a business and business of business. I’m not in a position to cope up with big institutions where the crowd is so high. Then, I decided to choose the institution with minimum strength.\n \nCivil Services Mission:\n \nI don’t want to mention the institution name but I found it. Things were going on my way. But here comes challenge again, I need to pay Rs.60,000 for my coaching. I had no idea how to pay.\n \nThanks for the Internet. I used to search on the Google for helping hands to support me, actually I’ve sent more than 2500 emails to different NGOs and trusts all over the India, including few persons individually whom I found on Google.\n \nI got few positive responses. Fortunately, I got support from them to continue my preparation. I paid the fee and I started working on my mission.\n \nStruggles and Sorrows:\n \nI had only three pairs of dresses. If I want to go for coaching I’ve to wear the one dress for two to three days.\n \nI did all the Hard Work what I can do. My only ambition is to get into the civil services. No other exams.\n \nI’ve written IAS examination 4 times in a row but failed to clear it. Twice, I had my mains. But no result. As I’m zero at maths, I was not in a position to take any other bank or SSC examination.\n \nDay and night struggles, I’ve had my tears. Things were changed at my home, mother and brother got hospitalized. My father is not caring anything about our family. I came back I’ve taken care of my family.\n \nFailure and Impact :\n \nEverybody is used to point me, they used to show me as a symbol of failure. I may failed in my IAS examination but I’m not going to fail in my life. I’m a fighter, though I failed in civil services, I learned a lot from the journey. How can a single sheet of examination paper can decide my future? Everybody is Unique, right?\n \nNo contacts. No relationships. No money.\n \nApproaching the Politicians :\n \nAs I’ve had immense knowledge as far as administration and policy making is concern, I approached few politicians to work as an assistant to them. But got rejected everywhere.\n \nEntrepreneurial Journey :\n \nFormal education will make you a living but Self-education will make you a Fortune. As the start-up revolution is going in India, I had a question in my mind – why don’t I start my career as an entrepreneur?\n \nI’ve had my ideas, I worked on it but again the lack of funding has become the major concern for me. Whatever the start-up idea I’ve in my mind, it has become a $100 million dollars company in USA. Of course, you may believe or you may not.\n \nNow???\n \nNow, I’m no longer in a position to write any examination or no longer want to work under someone. I want to become a self-made entrepreneur in any way. I’m not going to give up on my dreams.\n \n“if the plan is not working, change the plan but not the Goals”.\n \n“Body has it’s limitations but mind has no limits”\n \nThis information age is giving enormous amount of opportunity to each and every individual. I wanted to catch it and cash out.\n \nYour Help is Needed :\n \nI would love to welcome your suggestions or advices or help or criticism in any way.\n \nI may not be the perfect guy to answer you but I can feel and express my opinion by stepping into your shoes in a perfect way.\n \nI’m not giving up rather I’m challenging myself to get what I want.

But meat and veggies os the way to balance your hormones and lose the fat.\n \nAs for training.. if youve never lifted before i URGE you to hire a trainer. You don't have to work out with a trainer for ever but it is important to learn proper form and technique learn what exercises work what muscle groups and Lauren how hard to push yourself how long to wait between exercises order of exercises excetera excetera. Doing research is great but as I'm sure you have noticed for every answer you find you will find someone who says the opposite. Without a professional guiding you often times it's hard to know what advice to take comma granted not all “expert” advice in the health and field industry is really expert LOL. And not all trainers are created equal. You want someone with at least a year experience ask them about their previous clients and their success stories ask them about their methods and protocols and the reason why they use those methods. If they can't give you concrete answers to those questions look for a different trainer.\n \nI recommend I recommend weight training 2 days a week and doing two days of interval cardio. I like weights on Monday Thursday cardio Tuesday Friday. Focus on major muscle group multi-joint compound movements. No I promise you you will not get big bulky muscles. You will get strong lean and toned. Working the big muscles using the compound exercises burns the most calories and elicit the greatest hormone response and it's the hormones that really get the job done. Lyft hard-and-fast good in work hard for about 30 minutes and go home there's no reason to lift for more than that the training is determined by effort not volume or duration. So push hard for a short time until you feel and then go do something else. Interval cardio means going as hard as you can for a short period And then resting for a short period and repeating. The routine I like is only 4 minutes you go all out maximum Sprint for 20 seconds then walk for 10 seconds and repeat eight times. That routine is clinically proven four times more effective at both muscle building and fat burning when performed twice a week with 100% maximum effort than 60 Minutes of traditional steady state cardio performed five days a week. Yes you read correctly 8 minutes is superior to 300 minutes as long as you push 100%. Good luck.", "authorship": "human"}

It was down mainly to poor management along with a very young staff lacking direction and frankly near bankrupt.\n \nFive of us went in as consultants to get the company “cleaned up”, and to help out we engaged an American (claiming to be a) part qualified accountant. It turned out that he did not have the qualifications that he claimed, nor the European equivalent.\n \nOne of the Consultants was a very young but mature Nigerian chap, who did have qualifications gained in Nigeria and South Africa, but at that time in England not recognised. He was a “real” accountant, i.e. someone who knew what the answers should roughly be, not what a computer told him they should be and know when the latter was wrong. Not run by a computer, but the computer was a tool, but equally knew when that tool was defective !\n \nHe was a mountain of a man, about 6′ 3″ and probably the best part of 16 stone…. but muscle and bone; no waste (so to speak); equally one of the most gentle, well mannered person’s you could wish to meet.\n \nHe was doing some pretty serious work on the General Ledger, and some of that was going to directly affect the accounts for that month as well as other implications. The nature of this meant that he had to use some pretty complex Spreadsheet applications and formulae.\n \nThe two main consultants had Degrees in Law and Accountancy respectively and I had a specialisation in insolvency and debt collection to litigation standard. We had another junior member of staff of about 19 years old who was there to help us, mainly through the knowledge she had of the way the company worked before it got in to difficulties. She was good at what she did and extremely helpful but we needed an “in-between”.\n \nThat person was selected by one of the consultants without reference to the others, and it was more to do with nepotism than knowledge between the two. The American lad had a chip on his shoulder made of silicone and thought he was the greatest thing since sliced bread. Actually he was an ignorant, racist, nasty piece of work, (Incidentally I am native, white, English) and regrettably came over as the stereotypical arrogant American.\n \nHe held the assumption, that (in his view) everyone owed America everything. Indeed given that he was probably no more than 25 himself, he actually believed he knew more than everyone else as far as accountancy was concerned and that he was “pack leader”. Unfortunately one of the main consultants actually believed this and treated the boy as his mouth-piece.\n \nWe would frequently have informal staff meetings to keep each other up to date with what was going on, and where additional help (where this American lad, and the Ghanian Accounts Assistant fitted in) was to be deployed.\n \nThe Nigerian man, in his early thirties and was doing some pretty complex work on a spreadsheet, along with an interface with the in-house accounting system. Something that he could not really steer his attention from at the drop of a hat.\n \nThe “leader of the pack” (so to speak) decided to call one of these update meetings. The American lad had been talking to him, and stuck his head out of the office door and said: “ OK you guys’ - need to getta [sic] yourselves here now for a meeting !\n \nNnamdii, the Nigerian guy, who was working on this complex spreadsheet just raised his head and said that he would be along shortly. In reality, he did not need to be part of this particular update as it was Credit Control issues that were the main focus of the meeting.\n \nThis American brat, turned on Nnamdii and said: “ now listen coon: I told you to get here now so betta [sic] get your arse her or I’ll pound you Nigger: remember America owns you ! “ Pointing aggressively at Nnamdii\n \nThe four of us were stunned by the arrogance, near violent behaviour of this American lad, (who frankly could barely add up), not withstanding the incredibly racist statement and the aggressive way it had been delivered.\n \nHowever, there was one thing that this little chap hadn’t bargained on. I don’t think that he had ever seen Nnamdii stand up (in the physical sense) to his full height!\n \nVery calmly, and without shouting, Nnamdii “saved off” the spread sheet, and slowly looking up and over his glasses (he wore rounded spectacles which merely made the matter more intense) very quietly and calmly stood up; almost appearing to expand out of the chair like an inflatable.\n \nHe just pointed to the boy and said “don’t you ever make such a rude or racist statement like that to me!” ; you arrogant, ignorant little man.\n \nBy this time we were all thinking “ that guy is going to be dead- should we call an ambulance or under-taker first?”\n \nThe American lad, just dug himself in to an even deeper pit by turning to the rest of us and saying: “..you can’t let that shit talk to me like that…” .\n \nWe didn’t.\n \nThe Managing Director, having over head the commotion (from a floor away ! ), had walked in to the room, walked up to the boy and in one hand picked up the bag that the brought in to work, and gave it to him; in the other hand pointed to the door, and the only two words used were: “LEAVE. NOW !”\n \nAmazingly this American lad was still protesting that everyone was being unfair to him and should give him another chance (not realising I think that had Nnamdii not lost his temper he he would be dead) he was lucky to be alive in any case.\n \nThe MD just told the boy that he had called the Police and that he was to be escorted off site. For his own safety the boy was escorted out of the room by two other blokes who were in the room at the time and down to reception.\n \nHe was later charged with racial abuse, breaches of the Race Discrimination Act (civil action), Intent to cause an affray and breach of the peace (Criminal), abusive behaviour with intent to endanger life [on the basis had Nnamdii let loose he could have been killed] and that the affray could have caused damage and harm to other people (both Criminal).\n \nImmediately after the Hearing and Conviction, he was expelled to New York via the American Embassy in London. It later came back to us through the Agency that he had had his Passport withdrawn.\n \nAs they say in English Law: “take your victim as you find them”.", "authorship": "human"}

Well, if you are from a lower middle class family from India you will get to know the situation at which my father's friend was in. It was impossible for that guy to sustain his family with his earnings. My dad remained unemployed for a short time, as he couldnt get another one. Finally, He took up the job of a driver then eventually joining to one of my father’s senior to the same company. Seeing my father’s condition he offered to help and financed to some extent mine and my brother's educational expenses. I continued studying in the same school, ranked in top 10 schools of the state. Later on I moved to another school which was supposedly less expensive, in my high school. Took up science and wished to pursue MBBS and end the struggle my father did. He wished to see us well educated. Coaching seemed to be expensive so I didnt join any institute and went up with self study. I got a decent rank in NEET but it was not enough to fetch me a seat in a government college. Looked up to previous years results and found out that I had a 50-50 chance. Private medical colleges are a tad too much expensive. I thought of dropping an year but then again I had a short councelling with my father's friend who helped my father financially uptil now. Since completing my studies and starting my career would take atleast 15 years, I thought of dropping the idea altogether. I had a younger brother too, just two years younger to me. HENCE, I DIDNT SIT FOR COUNCELLING. Later on I found out that I could have got a seat in a govt college, but I have no regrets. I appeared for the engineering entrance too, on my fathers suggestion though not completely prepared. Even then I scored decently and was finally admitted to a private engineering college ranked in top 3 in my state. This too seemed unaffordable and hence took an educational loan for the same. Thats where I am now.\n \nHere come's the catch.\n I MADE NO FRIENDS. NOT A SINGLE ONE I CAN COUNT AS MY FRIEND. \n \n I was in my middle school when I was bullied a number of times by the \"richer\" one's of my batchmates. Well that was really awful and remember all those to this day. Really insulting. Later on I changed school and here I kept mum about my father's occupation. Whichever friend I made were kept a little way from my personal life limited to school only. I carried on with my studies but later on I felt It was wrong for my part. There wasn't any excuse to keep mum. But I carried on. With my school days over I dont think I will be able to make friends either. Everyone around me is counted as my competitor. I was relieved to find a few people on my first months in college whom I could count on but everthing went down as it came. We were considered notorious bunch, thanks to a few and hence were redistributed into two sections in the second semester, just 6 months into college. Later on some serious issues crept up and we split into smaller groups. The management succeded.\n \nThe closest ones that fit in th definition as a friend were a bunch of three in my high school, but still I kept them away from my personal life. Almost forgotten by now, as it seems. I didnt make any memories either and seems difficult for me living up later on.\n \nAs of now, was too much depressed by holding up so many things within me, adding the uncertainity of my future as an engineer. \nI dont count myself poor. I got the best opportunities possible, all thanks to my dad and mum\n. All that to be blamed was I, who made a blunder of myself.\n \nRead up somewhere that writing down all your thoughts relieves a bit.\n \nDidn\n’\nt want to draw much attention hence went anonymous.\n \nThank You.", "authorship": "human"}

I don't feel the need to explain this more.\n \nTalking about the diet plan in the case of morning workout, you have a plus point, that is, you get to intake more amount of healthy food before going to the gym in the morning, which is, an additional meal. After coming back from the gym, have a protein-oriented breakfast, a bit more than your appetite. Have small meals at regular intervals to keep the metabolism rate perfect and immune system active. Eat less in your dinner as compared to your lunch and have it atleast before 2 hours of going to bed.\n \nIf you still have some queries, you can message me anytime and I will revert back to you ASAP.\n \nP.S.: I'm not at all saying that evening workouts are bad or anything against, in fact, when I have to run to work early, I'm left with no other option but to train in evening which is not bad either.

Never mind that most second graders could tell you there are 50 states in the United States and there have been since 1959.\n \nBut neither of those prior stories which are true, compared to the most ignorant person I have met in America. I was working as a technician for a satellite company and when I was picking up equipment I asked one of the warehouse workers who had been issuing me equipment for many years why he didn't step up and become a satellite Tech, which was a position that could pay easily four to five times what he was making?\n \nHe was a black guy and all of his co-workers in the warehouse were also black guys at that time. He told me the reason that he could not become a technician was because I had “white privilege”!! I was very perplexed by this and ask him what the hell he was talking about ?!\n \nHe asked me if I was a homeowner and I said yes I am… white privilege, he responds.\n \nHe asked me if I had Investments in a stock portfolio? I said yes …White Privilege he responded!!\n \nSo I asked him, when you applied for your job did they violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and refuse to hire you because you're black ?\n \n“ No”\n \nWhen you filled out the application to move into the house that you're in either as a renter or a homeowner did they violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and refuse to rent or sell to you because you were black ?\n \n“ No”\n \n“Do you think that the stock broker who helped me open my investment account stopped me before he handed me the portfolio account application to make sure that I was a white guy because he wasn't about to help a black person or any other minority invest?\n \n…by this time he was getting the point of the questions I was asking and he realized how ignorant he was behaving, in addition to being racist towards white people. Judging somebody based on the color of their skin is despicable regardless of who the victim is.\n \nThis guy's worldview was that he was not allowed to succeed because he was black. In America this attitude is completely ignorant because if anybody in the United States truly wants to succeed all they have to do is try.

This isn't your typical shrug; using a snatch grip (a wide grip) on the barbell really targets the upper traps more intensely than a regular grip.\n \nTo perform it, I stand with my feet shoulder-width apart, grip the barbell with my hands spaced wider than shoulder-width, and then shrug my shoulders up towards my ears. The wider grip increases the range of motion and really isolates the traps. I do three sets of 10-12 reps, focusing on a slow, controlled movement and a strong contraction at the top.\nAnother exercise that has yielded fantastic results for my traps is the \nFace Pull with External Rotation\n. This exercise not only works the traps but also hits the rear delts and improves shoulder health.\n \nUsing a cable machine with a rope attachment, I set the pulley at about face height. I pull the rope towards my face, focusing on keeping my elbows high and squeezing my shoulder blades together. At the end of the pull, I rotate my wrists outward to emphasize the contraction in my traps and rear delts. I aim for three sets of 15 reps, keeping the movement slow and controlled to maximize muscle engagement.\n \nLastly, the \nDumbbell Farmer's Walk\n is an underrated but incredibly effective exercise for building trap strength and endurance. I grab the heaviest dumbbells I can handle and walk back and forth across the gym. The constant tension from holding the heavy weights forces my traps to engage and support my shoulders.\n \nI usually do this for 3-4 sets, walking for about 30-60 seconds each set. Not only does this build my traps, but it also improves my grip strength and overall core stability.\n \nThey might not be the most common choices, but their effectiveness is undeniable.

HELLO\n \nI had to patiently and diplomatically explain to them both that we were from Canada, the big *country* north of the US, while picking my jaw up off the ground at their stunning ignorance. Do US public schools not teach even a bare-bones-level of geography? How can any American NOT KNOW the countries immediately north and south of its borders, or even that there’s a country called Canada??\n \nOne more example of an ignorant American is really reflective of her *parents*, not her, because it was a minor child. My college bordered a busy residential side street that led to a student parking lot in the back and one day one my way to class, driving down the side street an 8–10-week-old puppy ran out from the driveway of a house toward my car. Being an animal-lover I pulled right over, jumped out, grabbed the puppy off the road, and carried her up the driveway where some children were playing. I returned their puppy and asked why they let her run loose into traffic. The oldest child, about 8 or 9 years old, said, “My mama says if that puppy don’t know enough to stay off the road it deserves to get hit.”\n \nInwardly I felt horrified at hearing such an ignorant, heartless thing, especially from a child. But instead of scolding the little girl who, judging from her house and neighborhood, was from a low-income, likely under-educated family, I crouched down and petted her puppy and said, “Do you remember when you were just a wee baby? Remember how when we were really little we didn’t know very much and had to have lots of time to learn stuff?” She nodded. “Well,” I continued, “your puppy is just a baby dog and she doesn’t know anything yet, either. She’s relying on you to teach her to stay off the road so she doesn’t get run over. Just like your mama probably taught you not to run into the road, right?”\n \nShe nodded again, yes. I told her she had a precious life in her hands, that her puppy also needed to be taught, and protected, like her mama had taught her, and if she took care that her puppy never ran into the road again that puppy would live and be her best friend. She smiled and I said goodbye and headed to class.\n \nI think and hope my message got through to that young girl and her siblings, and their ignorance wasn’t their fault—it was clear her mama either didn’t grasp, or care, that puppies need to be trained and confined to their own properties, and they deserve to be properly cared for and protected. That experience gave me a glimpse (one of many, especially in the US South) of generational ignorance that’s passed on between parents and children.", "authorship": "human"}

Body-weight squats are fantastic; aim for 3 sets of 15-20 reps. Throw in some lunges (forward or reverse) with 3 sets of 10 reps for each leg. Want to activate those glutes?

Each milestone (10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 100, 200, 300, 365 days) gives a huge mental boost. The first 100 are the hardest, but then it feels easy.\nWho You Run With: \nNever run alone. If you are not running with a friend or a run club, listen to your favorite artist for motivation. Create a Spotify playlist that makes you want to dance. Runners and Artists give you energy.\nWhat to Prep: \nSet your shoes and clothes out the night before your run. If you run in the morning, set it in your room so you see it right when you wake up. If you run at night, pack your clothes and shoes the day before in a gym bag.\nWhere to Run\n: Create a portfolio of your favorite routes near your home or work. Where have you already been training? You know these tracks, trails and streets like your own home, so you are confident going into these runs.\nWhen to Run\n: Run at the same time everyday. Block out the time on your schedule when it is the best time for you to run. The more consistent you are, the easier this gets. If your health is a priority, do it first thing in the morning every day after waking up so there are no excuses.\nListen to your Body\n: You will know your body better than anyone if you built a base first. Recovery is key. If you aren’t recovering between runs, then walk. Go back to the foundations. Easy days, healthy nutrition, and adequate sleep are the foundation.\nWhy Do You Run\n: There will be days that are going to be hard. Shitty weather. Low energy.

They learn and work without restraint to overcome the cycle of poverty.\n \nLesson 3: Compare to less\nI always compare myself to people who have more: more money, more knowledge, more free time, more muscles, more beard... It seems natural to all of us.\n \nBut what if we start comparing to those, who have less than we do? This post on Quora is a cold shower every time I start complaining of how tired I am, or how unlucky I am living in Ukraine, or how cheap my work is.\n \nComparing to those, who have fewer switches you from grudge to thankfulness.

Those are all good options, but let me suggest another one that will ensure you leave your workout in full body fashion—enter: full body workout finishers.\n \n—\n \nWhat the heck is a workout finisher?\nA workout finisher is a \nmini workout\n that you slide right at the end of your main workout. Finishers are great because they provide with you a highly effective full body workout in just a few minutes.\n \nBasically, finishers are designed to hurt.\n \nI mean not physically hurt you like getting spartan kicked in the chest would, but they should sting a little (or, a lot). Words and phrases that jump to mind when we’re talking finishers include:\nlactic acid buildup\nburning and searing\nthe darkest of pain caves\nbattery acid pumping through your veins\nI’m sure there are more but you get the idea.\n \nSo, how long should these epic pain-fests last?\n \nWell, there is no perfect answer here, but because the intensity of effort should be quite high I suggest keeping a finisher to around 8 (ish) minutes or less.\n \n—\n \nWhy finishers are awesome…\n \nBelow is the abridged list of why finisher are awesome:\naccelerate fat loss\nextremely time efficient\nincrease work capacity/conditioning\nincrease mental toughness and ability to endure “the suck”\n—\n \nWhat types of exercises make the best workout finishers?\nAgain, there is no perfect answer here, but my rule of thumb is to\n go lower on the skill side, and higher on the intensity side.\n \nThe reason I say this is that performing a bunch of highly technical/highly skilled movements as a finisher may actually decrease the intensity of effort.\n \nLet me explain.\n \nHighly technical and highly skilled movements require a great deal of finesse. If you’re super tired halfway through a finisher and you literally can’t do another rep of that high skilled movement (such as a muscle up), well my friend, you’re basically left just staring at the piece of equipment, letting your heart rate drop, and honestly not doing a finisher anymore.\n \nThis is the opposite of what you want.\n \nRemember, the goal with a finisher is to finish the workout with intensity. This means you’ll have to put a bit of thought into the exercises you select here. Personally, I’ve found the best exercises for finishers are the ones that allow you to keep grinding out reps, no matter how tired you get.\n \nExamples of these type of grind style exercises include:\nCardio machines\nBattle rope exercises\nVarious types of crawling\nAny sort of loaded carry\nKettlebell or dumbbell swings\nBasic bodyweight movements (pushups, squats, burpees,…etc)\nThis list is by no means exhaustive, but it definitely gives us a good place to start.\n \nWhen selecting exercises for a finisher the \nbig take-a-way is to shift more to grind style exercises vs. highly technical/high skilled exercises.\n Again, the point of doing this is to keep you moving, vs. just staring at the bottom of set of rings because you can’t nail your 5th muscle up in the finisher.\n \n—\n \nPutting it all together: 5 badass full body finishers\nFinisher #1→\n \nComplete as many rounds as possible in 6 minutes of:\n10 kettlebell swings\n50 foot goblet carry\n50 foot bear crawl\nFinisher #2→\n \nThree rounds of:\n12 dumbbell front squat\n12 dumbbell walking lunge steps (6 per leg)\n10 jump squats\n10 jump lunges (5 per leg)\nFinisher #3→\n \n30 hand release pushups\n16 burpees\n16 sandbag getups\n20 \nhand release pushups\n8 burpees\n8 sandbag getups\n10 hand release pushup\n4 burpees\n4 sandbag getups\nFinisher #4→\n \nThree rounds of:\n30 second dumbbell farmers carry (heavy)\n30 second bear crawl\n30 second air squats\n30 second dumbbell rack hold\n30 second hollow body hold\nFinisher #5→\n \n60 second stair climber (fast)\n20 kettlebell swings\n2 burpees\n45 second stair climber (fast)\n15 kettlebell swings\n2 burpees\n30 second stair climber (fast)\n10 kettlebell swings\n2 burpees\n \nThese five finishers all pack a potent punch, but for different reasons. However, two commonalities they share is their time effectiveness, and high suck factor rating.\n \n—\n \nFinal thoughts\n \nAs it seems, the answers you seek have already been laid out before you. I just wanted to throw finishers into the mix so you have a plan for “ending the workout with some intensity.” The five finishers I listed above will ensure that you finish any workout in full body fashion.\n \nGive them a try. Who knows, you might even love to hate full body workout finishers.\n \nHope this post is helpful.\n \nThanks for reading.\n-Tom C", "authorship": "human"}

Psychologist's call these people, 'Over-Motivated Underachievers' because they work hard (a prized cultural skill) but don't necessarily get anywhere because the body just can't handle high amounts of stress for long periods of time.\n \nThis is why phases are essential, your body needs rest to adapt.\n \nGenerally speaking most people can't tolerate high volume and high intensity at the same time (intensity is how high the percentage of 1RM any lifts are...1RM or above is the highest intensity), so you must balance the two. \n \nThis could be as simple as alternating between intensification phase and an accumulation phase (i.e. one phase is intense, low volume, high load - the other is volume oriented, lower intensity, higher volume, medium to low load).\n \nIt can be as complex as undulating sequences too, there are many components to neuromuscular training.\n \nDown weeks are also crucial here if you have high intensity or high volume training phases, allowing for supercompensation to take place is essential.\n \nWork + Rest = Success\n \n4 - Rest Changes\n \nThe less rest you give yourself between sets, between exercises, between training days and between training cycles, the harder it is on your system.\n \nThe more intense a workout, the more rest you need between sets and possibly workouts/phases.\n \nThe more volume in a workout, the more rest you need between workouts.\n \nManipulate rest to longer when you need it, and shorter when you want to challenge your nervous system in a new way.\n \nAgain - in phases.\n \n5 - Multi-Planar Adaptation\n \nThe problem with simplifying leg training to two major lifts is that these lifts often only address one plane of movement, forward and back (Sagital Plane it's called). \n \nYour muscles are 3-D, meaning you had better include some exercises eventually somewhere that require you to move laterally (i.e. Side Lunges, Lateral Sled Pushing, Shuffling, etc...) and rotationally (the transverse plane includes movements like chops, lifts, throwing, etc...).\n \nScientifically speaking, the body is capable of generating more power when engaged through all three planes (think of the amount of watts generated throwing a baseball or a shotput, it's significantly more than even a world-class squat or deadlift). \n \nDon't forget also to train unilaterally (one leg, like single leg squats, step-ups, lunges, etc...) as this forces the body into multiple planes of resistance.\n \nYou're leaving a lot of muscle untouched by training just two movements, or by using the majority of machines, and you're not refining your nervous system optimally.\n \ni.e. Single Leg, Single Arm Deadlifts challenge the body in all three planes. So would rotational rows, and standing position chops and lifts, among many others.\n \nSo would the majority of throwing activities, hitting activities, kicking (though more of the angular type found in soccer), etc... \n \nI'm not saying you should load patterns similar to your sport (you shouldn't, it's actually been shown to alter movement patterns to a point of decreased performance) but you should get out of the Saggital plane with your training from time to time and challenge your muscles as they are intended to be used, in 3-D).\n \nThere are a lot of good lifts at the gym that people either don't use correctly, or simply don't know.\n \n6 - Mechanical Loading Changes\n \nAre you lifting in your barefeet or in shoes, because the difference can matter to how your body responds. Barefoot will tax your feet/toes more than in shoes.\n \nThere are other considerations though, the overhead squat is significantly harder than a front or back squat because the mechanical advantage in the lift is reduced by the placement of the load above the head.\n \nPutting a dumbbell on one side only, taxes your body and your nervous system differently.\n \nPutting a dumbbell on the shoulders instead of the hands.\n \nA barbell instead of a dumbbell.\n \nChanging the angle of pull (wide stance, vs narrow stance) will change the outcome.\n \n7 - Threshold Considerations\n \nTraining the squat and deadlift all the time will train a lot of muscle, but it won't train the nervous system to respond to low threshold situations.\n \nYour nervous system is tuned to relax and contract at varying levels of intensity, so if low levels of intensity are out of whack (things like breathing, spinal segmental stabilization, etc...) your ability to fully engage at high nervous system thresholds is diminished.\n \nSo nervous system training kind of resembles a sliding scale from low to high threshold activities.\n \nIt seems a little on the 'girly' side (\nfor most men - while most women avoid the high threshold stuff\n) sometimes, but it's the smart way to train.\n \nEnsure that your body can tolerate body weight squats just as well as loaded squats. Basic glute bridges, just as well as heavy deadlifts.\n \nThese low threshold exercises are great for warm-ups.\n \ni.e. clamshells, quadruped lifts, plank variations, deadbugs, etc...\n \n8 - Range of Motion Considerations\n \nA quarter squat isn't the same as a full squat. The glutes and hamstrings are far more engaged in the latter.\n \nMobility training is important, and I generally encourage people to move through 'as full a range of motion as possible' when I'm coaching people. \n \nWork to improve your range of motion appropriately through all the major lifts, it will help a lot in your development at the gym.\n \nHowever, shortening up the range of motion can occasionally lead to break-throughs, and has it's place.\n \ni.e. you get stuck at the same spot on your bench press all the time, we can increase your strength at that point but employing a board press where you get stuck.\n \n9 - Addressing Weaknesses\n \nYou could squat and deadlift and hit a lot of muscle, but you'll plateau eventually.\n \nAt that point you'll want to start using accessory movements to push through them.\n \nIf hamstrings are the weak link then maybe we want to address them a little more intensely with romanian deadlifts or single leg romanian deadlifts, or glute ham raises?\n \nIf the glutes are the weak link, maybe we want to do some pull-throughs, or some loaded hip thrusts.\n \nIf the calves are a weak link, maybe we want to do some calf raises seated or standing, or some explosive jump training (which always lights my calves up...).\n \nUltimately, I'm missing some considerations for sure but the leg does the following movements worth training at some point:\n \nCircumduct the Ankle (rotation at the ankle)\nSupination and Pronation of the Ankle (Roll the foot inward and outward)\nPlantar Flex the Ankle (push foot down)\nDorsi Flex the Ankle (pull foot up)\nExtension/Flexion of Foot + Toes\nFeet Assist in Stabilizing the Ankle and Knee\nFlex and Extend the Knee\nStabilize the Knee\nExternally and Internally Rotate the Hip\nFlex and Extend the Hip\nADDuct and ABduct the Hip\nStabilize the Hip\nCombinations of all the above (the most likely and obvious training choices are ones that put your body through more than one of the movements above...)\nGood luck and enjoy yourself!", "authorship": "human"}

Whether you're looking to shed some pounds, build muscle, or boost your overall health, finding the right workout is key to sustaining motivation and achieving your goals. Let's dive into the world of fitness and shed light on how to choose the best workout tailor-fitted to your needs and lifestyle.\n \nUnderstanding Your Fitness Goals\n \nBefore jumping into the latest fitness craze, it's essential to get a clear understanding of what you want to achieve. Here's how to set realistic and personal goals:\nWeight Loss:\n If your aim is to lose weight, focus on workouts that enhance \ncardiovascular health\n and burn significant calories, such as HIIT, running, or spinning classes.\nMuscle Gain:\n For those looking to gain muscle mass, strength training and resistance exercises like weightlifting or bodyweight exercises will be your go-to.\nEndurance Building:\n Sports such as swimming, cycling, or long-distance running can increase your stamina and improve heart and lung function.\nFlexibility and Balance:\n Yoga and Pilates provide a perfect blend of stretching and core workouts to enhance these areas.\nOnce your goals are outlined, consider how each workout aligns with your lifestyle and how they can be incorporated into your daily regime.\n \nConsidering Workout Preferences and Lifestyle\n \nYour workout should not only meet your fitness goals but also jive with your interests and schedule. Consistency will become infinitely easier if you enjoy the process. Ask yourself:\nDo you prefer solitary workouts where you can go at your own pace, like jogging or solo weight training sessions?\nAre group classes such as Zumba, spinning, or CrossFit more motivating and fun for you?\nDoes your routine allow long workout periods, or are shorter, more intense sessions like Tabata training better?\nBalance is vital—not just on the yoga mat but also in scheduling workouts that fit into your life seamlessly.\n \nWorkout Types: Pros, Cons, and Who They're Best For\n1. HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training)\n \nPros:\nEfficient, burns many calories in a short period\nBoosts metabolism for hours after the workout\nCons:\nMay be challenging for beginners\nHigher risk of injury if not done with proper form\nBest for:\n Individuals with limited time seeking fast results.\n \n2. Cardiovascular Exercises (Running, Cycling)\n \nPros:\nImproves heart health and burns calories\nCan be done anywhere\nCons:\nCan be monotonous\nImpact on joints\nBest for:\n Beginners to advanced; those who enjoy outdoor activities.\n \n3. Strength Training (Gym Workouts, Calisthenics)\n \nPros:\nBuilds muscle and strength\nIncreases metabolism\nCons:\nRequires equipment or gym access\nProgress may be slower\nBest for:\n Those looking to tone up or increase strength.\n \n4. Yoga and Pilates\n \nPros:\nImproves flexibility and core strength\nReduces stress\nCons:\nMay not burn as many calories\nRequires patience and discipline\nBest for:\n Individuals seeking a low-impact option focusing on mental and physical well-being.\n \nIncorporating Recovery and Nutrition\nRemember that the best workout routine is incomplete without proper recovery and nutrition. Always schedule rest days to allow your body to recover, and fuel your workouts with a balanced diet rich in proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and micronutrients. Hydration is also non-negotiable—keep the water flowing!\n \nConclusion\n \nThe best workout for you is one that you enjoy, that fits your lifestyle, and that moves you towards your fitness objectives. Assess your preferences, experiment with different types, and listen to your body's responses. Dedication to progress rather than perfection will lead to sustainable health benefits and personal satisfaction.\n \nRemember to consult with fitness professionals and possibly get a health check-up before starting a new workout regime. Their guidance can help you modify workouts to your level, increasing both effectiveness and safety.\n \nAs you begin this journey, celebrate every step forward. Whether it's a faster mile, a heavier lift, or simply the discipline to show up to your yoga mat—each accomplishment is a testament to your commitment to a healthier you.\n \nBegins with these \n5 key principles you must apply\n in order to STOP the rapid onset of aging that's going on right now, reverse it, and begin \"aging backwards\" by restoring your body's natural youth hormones.", "authorship": "human"}

Looking to ensure you move forward properly to ensure optimal results?\n \nWhen it comes to forming a workout, there are many ways you can go about getting the job done. There is not one ‘perfect’ strength training or cardio workout program for everyone, but rather, one that’s right for you.\n \nThis said, there are some important ground rules that everyone should remember when forming their workout program. If you are not abiding by these rules, you could be in for problems down the road.\n \nLet’s look at the seven important commandments of an effective workout program.\n \nCommandment #1: Thou Shall Prioritize Compound Lifts\n \nBicep curls, leg extensions, lunges, squats, push-ups… there are so many exercises, how can you choose?\n \nFirst, prioritize the compound exercise. A compound exercise is one that utilizes more than one muscle group at once, thus you are getting a higher overall level of calorie burning as well as strength progression.\n \nThis includes moves like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, bent over rows, shoulder presses, lunges, and pull-ups. Do these first and foremost in your program. Once they are scheduled in, then you can begin focusing on the other more isolated exercises.\n \nIn some cases, you may not even need those isolation exercises depending on what your goal is and what type of workout program set-up you’re using.\n \nCommandment #2: Thou Shall Obey The 48 Hour Rest Rule\n \nNext, make sure that you are always obeying the 48 hour rest rule. What does this mean? It means that you must be taking at least 48 hours between workouts for the same muscle group.\n \nThis is the total amount of time it’s going to take for your muscles to recover appropriately between sessions. So if you hit chest on Monday, don’t do any chest focused exercises until Wednesday at the earliest.\n \nBut remember, because you hit shoulders while hitting chest (as they are called into play as well), this means shoulders should not be done until Wednesday as well.\n \nThis can take a good amount of planning on your part, but if done properly, will make a big difference in the level of recovery and results that you see.\n \nCommandment #3: Thou Shall Incorporate Sufficient Variety\n \nAnother important rule of effective workout programming is that you are incorporating enough variety into the workout routine. This not only helps keep you mentally fresh and invested in the program, but it also helps keep your body responding as well.\n \nIf you are going to the gym and doing the exact same workout day after day, guess what? It’s only going to be so long before your body gets bored. And, when your body gets bored, you stop seeing results.\n \nIf you are stuck in a progress plateau, try changing things around. Usually this is enough to get your results moving again. It doesn’t need to be big changes you are making either. Something as simple as using a different rep range or changing the exercises you’re performing around should be sufficient.\n \nCommandment #4: Thou Shall Not Skip Warm-Ups\n \nShort on time in the gym? Figure you’ll bypass the warm-up to save time? You might want to think again.\n \nWarm-ups are a must. Yes, they will take an additional five to ten minutes out of your workout routine, but they help ensure that you are going to see optimal results as your muscles will be firing stronger, thus you’ll be able to lift more weight.\n \nOh, and they help you avoid injury as well. If you are injured, you won’t be doing any exercise, so clearly this is critical. Take the time and do the warm-up. You’ll be thankful you did.\n \nCommandment #5: Thou Shall Always Use Proper Form\n \nUsing proper form is also a necessity when it comes to seeing great results. Too many people let their ego get in the way. They add weight sooner than they should be and even though the form is sacrificed, keep going.\n \nThis usually leads them to either not seeing results at all, or worse, ending up injured.\n \nThe minute you move out of good form, stop the exercise. Lighten the load and start again. Using good form will ensure you are hitting the muscles are you are supposed to for that movement, guaranteeing you see superior results.\n \nCommandment #6: Thou Shall Apply Overload\n \nNext, it’s also a must that you apply proper overload. If you go into the gym and don’t challenge your muscles, you can’t expect to see results. It’s that simple.\n \nOverload can come in the form of more reps performed or more weight lifted. It doesn’t really matter as long as you get it done one way or another.\n \nRemember, you need a change in your workout in order to get your body to change. If you aren’t changing anything, there’s no motivation to get stronger or more fit.\n \nCommandment #7: Thou Shall Have Fun\n \nFinally, the last commandment is one that is too often neglected - fun. That’s right, your workouts should be fun as well. If you aren’t having fun in the gym, the chances that you keep going back for more are going to be a lot less and you might just find that you forgo exercise all together.\n \nWith so many different ways to structure your workout, there’s no reason to not have fun. If your current plan isn’t enjoyable, try a few new types of exercises instead.\n \nRemember that you don’t even have to be doing exercises in the gym to get in a great workout either. You can take your workouts outdoors, to the local park, or to a sporting field if that’s what you prefer as well. Exercise comes in many shapes and forms and while not all variations will yield the same results, having fun needs to be a priority.\n \nSo keep these points into consideration as you plan out your workout program. By doing so, you’ll help ensure you see maximum success.", "authorship": "human"}

This combination works particularly well in casual settings, such as summer outfits or home decor, where light pink can be paired with white furniture or decor to create a clean look.\n \n2. Pink and Gray\n \nGray is a great neutral backdrop for pink. The softness of pink with gray creates a sophisticated and modern look that’s perfect for clothing and interior design. Light pink can soften the starkness of gray tones, making them more appealing.\n \n3. Pink and Black\n \nFor a bold statement, pairing pink with black can create a striking contrast. This combination is common in the fashion world, where bright pink outfits are paired with black accessories or bottoms, adding an edgy touch to the overall outfit.\n \n4. Pink and Blue\n \nBlue tones, especially softer shades like pale blue or denim blue, pair well with pink. This combination creates a tranquil vibe and works well both in fashion (like a pale pink shirt with blue jeans) and in home decor (like light pink walls with navy furniture).\n \n5. Pink and Green\n \nDue to their opposite positions on the color wheel, greens complement pink beautifully. This pairing ranges from soft mint greens paired with pale pinks to darker emerald greens paired with bolder pinks for a vibrant look.\n \n6. Pink and Brown\n \nBrown tones add warmth when paired with pink, creating an earthy yet stylish hue. Dull or muted pinks work well with rich browns, both in clothing choices and interior spaces.\n \n7. Pink and Yellow\n \nBright yellow adds a cheerful feel when paired with pink, perfect for playful designs or summer outfits. This lively combination is perfect for creating a vibrant space or a fun fashion statement.\n \nIn summary, pink looks great with white, gray, black, blue, green, brown, and yellow, creating a variety of styles from soft and elegant to bold statements.", "authorship": "human"}

But let's just get one thing straight here - if you are doing \nany\n kind of workout then it's going to have a greater impact than if you weren't. Simple as that.\n \nOf course there are caveats. You don't want to get hurt, so they can pretty much all be summed up into one commandment: Thou shalt not be an idiot. Getting under a bar loaded with 495 lbs and squatting it is an experience reserved for a very small percentage of people. There is zero reason to think that you need to do that unless you are 100% sure you can. And the people that do it take safety precautions when they do because they know s@&t can go sideways for the best of us so it makes sense to be prepared. That doesn't mean don't lift heavy. It \ndoes\n mean that heavy is a relative concept, not an absolute one. If 95 lbs feels super-heavy to you on bench then guess what? It is. The dude on the bench next to you repping 315 is not relevant to your perception.\n \nYou know all the things people like to give huge importance to? Things like “How long should I rest between sets?”, “How many reps should I do?”, “Are preacher curls better than standing curls?”, “Should I drink a protein shake during my workout or after? How long after?” … are all interesting questions but the truth is the answers have more to do with refinement than gross progress. Get in, lift weights, eat food and don't be an idiot and you will build muscle.\n \nThen there's cardio. Want to create a calorie deficit? Do cardio. Want to improve your heart’s performance? Do cardio. Should you do HIIT? Sure. Why not. Should you do long, slow duration? Sounds good. My rule for cardio is this: if you're just putting in the time then you won't get too much out of it. Come up with little challenges for yourself and then beat them. Maybe it's a certain calories/minute average. Maybe it's maintaining a certain speed for a certain time. Maybe it's keeping your heart rate above a certain number. Maybe it's that you want your shirt to be fully drenched when you're done. Whatever it is I promise that setting a goal and then beating it will ensure your cardio has an impact. Getting too detailed about it is great for refinement but once again the gross value is in making it happen.\n \nMost of us who train won't be Mr. Olympia, or win an Ironman triathlon. At the elite levels there are little refinements that need to be made, but those vary on an individual basis. For the general population who wants to be fit, healthy and strong (and look good along the way) overthinking is overwhelming. As Nike so perfectly puts it, just do it.", "authorship": "human"}

I have equipment at home. I would work my arms when I got up. Get out of bed start with a set of curls. My theory was that by doing enough to get a pump in the morning, when I came home from work, later at the gym and a few sets to get a blood flush in my arms just before bed. Keeping the blood in the tissue was the goal. I had spectacular results in less than 3 months. I gained over an inch a month on my arms.\n \nI did this in the mid eighties. I ate food that I purchased at the grocery stores and restaurants. I took vitamin supplements. Knox Gelatin and cod liver oil protected my joints.\n \nI lifted heavy, three sets trying for four strict reps and then cheating for the next four but resisting and slowing the eccentric part of the movement which should always be done with a full range of motion, working the eccentric part of the rep to shape the muscles.\n \nWhile the pro bodybuilders at that time were eating jars of baby food while working out I found something better. I didn’t know it at that time either but today it is known through science that when a bodybuilder completes his workout the best way to increase the cells absorption of the post workout protein is for the bodybuilder to eat two slices of white bread or a cup of white rice. The simple sugars in the refined grain tempts the cells to open taking in more of the protein maximizing muscle growth.\n \nIn the afternoon when I returned home from work I would have a snack of peanuts and fresh squeezed cider while doing some arm exercises. The peanuts supplied fat, protein and so many vitamins and minerals as well as arginine. A cup of peanuts has more than 3X the arginine as a most whey servings supplying 40 grams of protein. The natural sugar in the cider opened up the cells sucking in the nutrients while the arginine dilates the cardiovascular system. Before going to bed I would maybe 6 ounces of peanuts and have a glass of apple juice while doing enough arm exercises to get the pump back in.\n \nI was really doing a full workout in the morning, a teaser when I got home from work, a full workout at the gym, and enough to flush and pump my arms just before bed.

To explore this, it's essential to consider several key factors, including the global digital divide, the nature of poverty, and the demographics of Quora's user base.\nThe Global Digital Divide: Despite the increasing affordability of internet access, a significant digital divide persists worldwide. This divide is not just about access to the internet but also about the quality of access, including speed and reliability. While in many developed countries, high-speed internet is ubiquitous and relatively cheap, in numerous developing countries, access remains limited, expensive, or both. This disparity is evident in the International Telecommunication Union's data, which reveals vast differences in internet penetration rates across different regions.\n \nNature of Poverty: Poverty is a multifaceted issue that involves more than just income levels. It includes aspects like access to education, healthcare, and technology. People living in poverty, even in regions with relatively high internet penetration, may prioritize basic needs such as food and shelter over internet access. Moreover, poverty often correlates with limited educational opportunities, which in turn affects individuals' ability to engage with platforms like Quora that are primarily text-based and require a certain level of literacy and knowledge to navigate and participate effectively.\n \nDemographics of Quora's User Base: Quora, as a platform, tends to attract users who are interested in sharing knowledge and engaging in intellectual discourse. This demographic is likely to include individuals with at least a basic level of education and digital literacy. Consequently, the platform may inherently appeal less to those who, due to socioeconomic constraints, have had limited access to educational resources.\n \nAccessibility and Inclusivity on Quora: While Quora is accessible to anyone with internet access, there are barriers beyond just the physical ability to log onto the site.

Before that, I lived on a sofa in an apartment shared with two alcoholics/occasional crack smokers for $300/month and the internet was included. Before that, I had a job and was living in a $750/month bachelor apartment paying the aforementioned local isp $30/month for internet. Before that, I had no job and internet was included, before that it was included, before that it was included, before that it was included. If one pays rent, there is usually internet. Except for the bachelor, the one case where internet was not included, the duplex, was when the landlord was a literal psychopath.\n \nI have used Quora for 4–5 years. For the latter 3 of years I have been poor. I originally started using Quora to acquaint myself with tech culture. I was an arts major and wanted to find my way into the tech sector. I never found my way into the tech sector, but I was well prepared to witness the considerable changes seen in society on account of the almost unprecedented recent advancements in technology. I focused on learning to manage and save money until the information given through Quora became repetitive; my parents were not able to endow me with this perspective. After, I focused on ways to make money. I’ve found recurring viable methods which I believed were suitable for me mentioned. Investing in real estate. ecommerce. Trading stocks and currencies. Then I realized these all take initial resources to begin making money with. There are good reasons I’m poor and these methods are not for me at this time. This is where I’m at now.\n \nMany things I’ve realized through Quora have significantly shaped who I am as a person. There is a lot less uncertainty for me in regards to how money can be made, kept and spent. Before Quora, did I think a millionaire had access to whatever luxury? Probably yes. Now I know one million dollars is not a lot of money. Twenty million dollars is a lot of money, in my opinion. I’m given $1050/month through disability assistance, by the way. In any case, a millionaire does not necessarily have the ability to choose between all luxuries. I’ve learned ideas come and go. They don’t have to be trendy, sophisticated and certainly not world-changing to make money. Since I’m now focusing on making a living beginning with the amount of resources I have on hand, my most recent ideas for doing so have been focusing on growing a particular kind of mushroom and getting a newspaper route. I have seen the mushrooms sold in health food stores at a very high cost. I know the market on them is cornered. The mushrooms are esoteric, produced in a small amount of far off facilities and I believe I know how, discovered through local lore no less, to grow them more effectively. The newspaper route, I believe I might just be able to manage most immediately.\n \nSo- this poor person uses Quora with a focus on learning to make a living. Along with a close friend, this site helps me maintain momentum on the path to finding a career. I use it to learn, sometimes as a way to keep busy, to express myself. For perspective I did not have access to previously, inspiration, mentorship. I want to contribute to society while doing right by my needs, if you will, and clarifying both those ends is an ongoing process for me. Not to imply you think poor people may necessarily have distinct reasons for using Quora, but to state poor people have the same reasons for using Quora as those otherwise do; I am a curious and rational animal with internet access.", "authorship": "human"}

Make use of technology to help you stay accountable.\n \n5. Take advantage of your surroundings.\n \n2. What are some tips to help you make time for working out if you're not a morning person?\n \nIf you're not a morning person, finding time for a workout can be tough. But don't worry, there are plenty of ways to make fitness work for you. Here are some tips to help you make time for working out:\n \n-Find a time that works for you. If you can't get to the gym in the morning, try going at night. Or, if you're really pressed for time, try doing a quick workout at home.\n \n-Schedule your workouts like you would any other appointment. This will help keep them top of mind and prevent them from getting pushed to the bottom of your to-do list.\n \n-Make use of technology. There are lots of great fitness apps and streaming services that make it easy to squeeze in a workout no matter where you are.\n \n-Get a workout buddy. Having someone to hold you accountable and push you to work harder can be a huge help when it comes to staying on track.\n \n3. What are some tips to help you make time for working out if you're not a night owl?\n \nIf you're not a night owl, don't try to work out in the evening. You'll be more likely to make excuses and skip your workout if it's scheduled for a time when you're already winding down. Instead, try to work out first thing in the morning or during your lunch break. That way, you'll have already accomplished something and you won't feel guilty about taking some time for yourself later in the day. And if you can't fit in a full workout during those times, try to at least do some quick exercises like squats or lunges. You'll be surprised at how much of a difference even a few minutes can make!\n \n4. What are some ways you can fit fitness into your schedule no matter the time of day?\n \nWhen it comes to fitting fitness into your schedule, there are no excuses. Just because you're busy doesn't mean you can't find time for a workout. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n \n- Rise and shine: Start your day with a fitness routine. Whether you do yoga, go for a run or lift some weights, getting your sweat on in the morning is a great way to set the tone for the day.\n \n- Lunch break: If you can't get away for a full workout, try squeezing in a quick fitness routine during your lunch break. A 20-30 minute walk or jog is a great way to break up the day and get your blood flowing.\n \n- Evening routine: Dedicate time at the end of the day for fitness. This could be 30 minutes of cardio or an hour-long strength training session. If you have time constraints in the evening, try mixing and matching different workouts to create a shorter routine.\n \n5. What are good ways to stay active even if you can't work out?\n \nEven if you can't always make it to the gym or go for a run, there are plenty of other ways to stay active. In fact, simply incorporating more movement into your day can help burn calories and improve your overall fitness level. Here are a few ideas to get you started:\n \n1. Park your car at the far end of the lot.\n \n2. Take the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator.\n \n3. Walk or ride your bike to work or school instead of driving.\n \n4. Do some squats or lunges during your commercials breaks.\n \n5. Take a brisk walk in your neighborhood after dinner.\n \n6. Use a fitness tracker to monitor your daily activity level.\n \nConclusion:\n \nWe all know how important it is to stay active and fit, but sometimes life gets in the way. With a little bit of creativity and organisation, though, you can find time to work out – no matter how busy you are.

Everyone in our grade breathed a sigh of relief at the prospect of not having to deal with him anymore. I’m not going to go into detail about what he did in class, but let’s just say my Mythology teacher let loose a scream of frustration because of him and caused all the teachers in the hall to check up on her on one instance.\n \nLet’s call him Thomas.\n \nAnyways, in my freshman year of high school, we ended up going to the same school, but fortunately, I only had one class with him, and that was French. Now, I take my language classes very seriously. \nVery \nseriously. And so with Thomas disrupting the class with inane comments about \neverything\n, (and some of them being extremely sexist and flippant about genders and whatnot) I was ready to pull my hair out. I’m pretty sure the entire class was too, along with our poor teacher. But that’s not the point of this.\n \nOne day, the teacher pulled up Google maps to show us where the small country of Andorra is. As she was dragging the map to it, Thomas let out a dramatic gasp.\n \nBy then, the class as a whole had already silently decided that we would all ignore him and his unwanted commentary.\n \nHowever, what came out of Thomas’ mouth just made all of us simultaneously turn our heads to him to stare in disbelief.\n \n“That’s where Italy is? I thought it was in China!”\n \nThe entire class just stared at him with mouths gaping open like fish. Meanwhile, he was sitting in his desk looking genuinely confused about that. After a few seconds of silence and the realization that he actually didn’t know that Italy was indeed, \nnot\n in China, the teacher cautiously pointed to the smart board/Promethean thingy and said,\n \n“Well, there’s Italy. And here’s Andorra. And make a side note that China does not contain Italy, because otherwise, the Roman Empire would have also been in China, and that just doesn’t make any damn sense.”\n \nSeeing as this was Thomas though, he still insisted that Italy was in China.

Unless you live in a bedsit - one room with bedroom, kitchen (sometimes shared), bathroom (most of the time shared with two other people) - you cannot live on your own. Basic rent for a house/ flat in my city which is not poor but not great either is around £550 per month, then you have 80-£120 council tax, £30 water, £30 gas, £30 electric (these are estimates). This before you are talking about food, travel expenses, clothing, having children, phones etc.\n \nContrary to popular belief, most people in the so called first world countries are not rich or do not have more money, yes we might have more than others, however most of it is on credit.

Why am I even answering this question on Quora?\n \nThe answer, lies in my first sentence. I feel poor everyday. Why? Because, in the school I attend, all students are from extremely wealthy families, with an estimated average income of about $15,500. Pretty much everyone has at least 2 cars, with a chauffeur at their command at all times. They go for expensive dinners and trips. They all have iPhones, Gucci and Versace threads, expensive suits, and a lot of admirers.\n \nOn the other hand, I travel by public transport. My family has ONE car. I don’t have expensive watches, nor phones (not that I need them). Only the usual ones. I have common clothes (not cheapskate, but just \nnormal\n). We dine out at normal restaurants, and I have never been abroad. Only domestic.\n \nSpending hours with these kind of people from societies that I don’t belong to, had been a very sad part of my life. I did not want to attend school anymore. I didn’t want to use public transport anymore. I was tired, sick of my life. The poor kid sleeping on the road would be jealous of my life, but I was sick of it.\n \nThen, I thought about it, I thought how hard my parents work, just for my benefit. I thought, that I must give my parents, what I desire. Not expect them to give it to me. And here I am today, renowned all over my school, as THE artist, THE physicist, THE swimmer, and THE debator.\n \nYes, it was my self confidence, that helped me change myself.

However, resistance training which is often overlooked is equally needed for the maintenance of a healthy weight. As you age, the body’s bone density and muscle mass deplete. To maintain proper metabolic function, weight training is imperative! Building strong muscles means burning more calories at rest, ultimately resulting in a healthier body weight. For beginners, I recommend at least 2 days of weight training a week along with at least 3 days of cardiovascular exercise. While this may seem like too much time, you can combine the two activities! Moves like jump squats and burpee’s get your heart rate up and your muscles burning!\n \n2. Change up your routine:\n \nFitness does not have to be boring! Keeping fitness fun will not only improve your adherence to exercise, but it is actually proven that changing the FITT (frequency, intensity, time, and type) of your exercise routine will yield better results. For fun workouts ideas check out my Instagram page \n@bodyby.becca.\n \n3. The ’80-20’ rule- Flexibility is Key\n \nThe ‘All or Nothing’ mindset is inherently destructive. You don’t need a 1 hour workout or a perfect day of clean eating for it to “count.” No one is perfect and your healthy routine won’t be either! I use the ’80-20’ rule when discussing healthy lifestyle habits with clients. Meaning, 80% of the time you make consciously healthy decisions (intuitive eating and exercise) while 20% of the time strict adherence is not necessary. Just as one good meal won’t make you healthy, one missed workout wont make you unhealthy! I have found this strategy to be attainable for both myself and clients; in turn, resulting in the greatest rate of long term success. Eat the ice cream once and a while, it won’t kill you. Mental health is just as important as your physical health!\n \n4. Macronutrient Essentials:\n \nNo, you don’t need to count calories or macronutrients, but awareness of what is going into your body is key. In order to look and FEEL your best, the body requires all three macronutrients: carbohydrates, protein and fat. Try to include all three categories every time you sit down for a meal. If you miss one during one meal, make up for it the next! Again, flexibility is key.\n \nExamples of carbohydrates include: vegetables, grains, fruits.\n \nExamples of protein include: chicken, salmon, quinoa, beans.\n \nExamples of fat include: avocado, nuts, olive oil.\n \n*** Note that the caloric value of fats is necessary but DOES add up fast, so I recommend measuring out these foods before consumption.\n \n5. Drink Water:\n \nTip: drink a full glass of water before every meal to help curb your appetite.\n \nThe benefits of water consumption cannot be reiterated enough! Drinking water promotes weight loss by removing the by products of fat from the body. On top of that, it fills your stomach, helping you differentiate between real hunger and thirst, which your body can misinterpret as hunger.\n \n6. Take a well rounded approach to fitness:\n \nThe benefits of eating well and adopting healthy lifestyle habits go far beyond the physical. The mental changes you experience are immeasurable. Of course, the specifics vary depending on the person. From my experience, I have less self doubt and stress, along with more energy, confidence, and happiness since adopting a healthy lifestyle. Unknowingly, these benefits manifest much more quickly than the physical goal and seep into all facets of your life: relationships, work or school, and social life. Being consciously aware of these changes will help you appreciate this amazing journey and the progress you have made so far.", "authorship": "human"}

She has money, she goes to a good school, she is in honors classes and is decent at Algebra, but when it comes to anything else……..\n \nLet's go with Geography or geopolitics. We were waiting on the teacher to return from lunch and everyone was talking amongst themselves and I was speaking with a friend. Carley randomly asks me, “Ali Emami is Indianapolis a state?”\n \nAnother one that actually brings rage to me is her theory on Sandy Hook. She says it was a hoax and that it never happened. Her exact words are “Sandy Hook is a government plot to take our guns, Obama set it up because he is working with ISIS to take over our Country.” I'm not even going to comment on that one.\n \nAnd last but not least, her friend asked her to name off the 7 Continents. Her response was as follows: “America, Europe, China, Australia, Africa, and Germany, by the way, you can't trick me because there are not 7 continents, there are only 6”", "authorship": "human"}

I'll call her Rachael.\n \nSo, we all spent hours debating the war (stupid, really stupid, or worst decision ever?!), read article after article, printed out little posters for our dormroom doors, went to protests, everything we could do, but Rachael was a step above. She didn't just protest, she went to every campus demonstration, big and small. She drove to other cities to protest no matter how much school work she had to do. She even organized groups and carpools to drive large groups of students to those protests with her. Every conversation we had at least reference the upcoming war for months. She talked about how this was our generation's moment to make a stand with a sincerity my cynical nature could never hope to imitate. She was the most dedicated activist of anyone I knew.\n \nThen the invasion started, the US crushed the Iraqi army, and within a few weeks it was done (at least the initial invasion was). My generation couldn't stop it, but my friends were getting ready to protest such a senseless waste of life and money, and to keep protesting for as long as it took. We would soon be able to see that there were never any WMD's, never any connections to 9/11, that the whole thing was just a giant power grab. The day after Baghdad fell there was a knock on my door. It was Rachael.\n \n“Jason, we won.”\n \n“What do you mean?”\n \n“The US won the war.”\n \n“Well, of course we did. We were always going to win .”\n \n“I thought we were protesting because we were going to lose.”\n \n“…”\n \nI will never, ever, argue that my side in a political debate holds the positions that we do because we are smarter or better educated than our opponents.

I was not super happy with the quality of his work, but had a short timeline and few options, so decided to make the best of it. I made sure that I was paying him pretty well for his time and energy by market standards, so did not expect much guff.\n \nAt one point, just a few weeks before the project was due, he asked if I could please stop \nsending\n him project related emails late at night (my normal hours for such things). It was waking him up, he said, and besides he thought it was “unprofessional” for me to hit send while he was sleeping. I should wait until his normal business hours to do so.\n \nNote that at no point had I complained about him not responding to my messages late at night. In fact, I’d gone out of my way to establish with him that 48–72 hours was perfectly acceptable response time, otherwise I would call or text him if it was urgent. By definition, anything I emailed him was important and totally non-urgent\n \nHe literally thought that I should keep track of the hours that he and the other team members kept and only \nwrite \nemails during that time. He was quite adamant that it was, and I repeat this nincompoop’s words, “unprofessional” for me to do otherwise.\n \nI was, in fact, dumbfounded and could not think of what to respond. In that moment, I could not think of anything in recent memory I’d personally heard with my own ears that was quite so ignorant.\n \nThe medium was designed, after all, so that person A could write and send it any old time that was convenient to them and person B could read and respond in turn when it suited them, in this way being just like paper mail, only faster. The recipient can set up whatever device (pc, tablet, phone) they receive email on anyway they like to suit their own preferences (which the sender could not possibly know). In other words, he could just silence notifications when he went to sleep (although for what I was paying him, he could easily have set up a temporary web-based mail account — for free — specifically for this project and only even logged in to it every few days).\n \nIronically, for 10–12 years of my career in high tech (in San Francisco/Silicon Valley) I specialized in email, in some cases rolling it out on a global scale for large companies. “Unprofessional”, therefore was not merely a ridiculous accusation in this context, but literally untrue.\n \nOnly later did it occur to me that I should have told him the only time I could sign his check would be late at night but, as a professional courtesy, would decline to do so.\n \nIf I’m wrong, by the way, someone please tell me in the comments. I’d hate to, like, write birthday and holiday cards or something when the people I’d send them to were taking a nap!\n \nI know there are much more important issues to be ignorant on, but this one still stands out in my mind.", "authorship": "human"}

I returned to Thailand and subsequently won my 1st race back.\n \nWell that turned out to be my only 1st place - although I still got the occasional podium after resuming overtraining.\n \nI stopped racing and started back in the gym about 5 years ago.

Because frankly, writing some long ass answer hailing myself and my good habits is just too awkward for my taste.\n \nI’ve always been bad at flossing.\nDENTAL flossing.\nThat’s more like it.\n \nI’ve tried creating a steady flossing habit for what feels like my whole life.\n \nI often manage to get started too, but somehow, my routine always falls off a cliff. I’m going at it, gaining steam for a couple weeks, and then”\npoof,” \nmy momentum stops, dead in its tracks.\n \nJust like with you and training, I know flossing is good for me. I’ve seen horrific pictures of rotten, brown teeth and they scare the living shit out of me. I’m definitely motivated to floss.\n \nWhat makes my failures even stupider is that flossing takes little to no time and doesn’t require anything but the smallest amount of effort. I don’t even have to leave the house—I’ve had the same damn flossers in my bathroom cabinet since the Mongols laid waste to all of Eurasia.\n \nI have no excuses.\n \nBut I can’t do it.\n \nSo what gives?\n \nOne part of creating good habits is getting the ball rolling.\n \nBecause healthy routines are like a ball of snow rolling down a hill, steady gaining size and speed. It’s hard to get it moving in the beginning and the longer we do something, the easier it is to keep doing it. But this, while true, is also not helpful. “Just do it” is bad advice, because \nwe’re already trying to.\n \nThis view, of self-discipline=routines, creates a chicken-egg situation: to build healthy routines, we need self-discipline over a long period of time; but self-discipline is in itself a healthy routine, so how the flying fuck do we create that in the first place?\n \nAnother—often underrated—aspect of habit-creation is making the habit as \neasy to implement as possible.\n \nIt’s not about powering through using the self-discipline we wish we had, but creating \nan environment\n where a habit is likely to prosper.\n \nI’ve been flossing every day for 4 months now.\n \nI guess I deserve a medal or at least a diploma of some sort.\n \nWhat’s crazy is how the way I finally made it stick is so stupid and simple I can’t even fathom it.\n \nI put the flosser \nwith\n \nmy toothbrush.\n \nI was already brushing my teeth. I mastered that shit in kindergarten. Now, every time I do that deeply ingrained habit, I get an instant reminder to up my flossing game while I’m at it.\n \nI also bought approximately a lifetime’s worth of dental floss so I always have some available.\n \nBecause I know, If I have to go the store to buy some, it’s not happening.\nWhen we start doing something new and challenging, our identity and previous habits become this force of nature, pulling us back, to our previous selves.\n \nOur status quo.\n \nTo oppose those forces, we need to create our own force field, one which pulls us toward the habits we wish to create.\n \nI see too many people spend their whole existence in an epic fight to go to a dimly lit place and lift weights/and or run on a treadmill.\n \nWorking out shouldn’t be an epic battle.\n \nStupid as it is, we often stop doing what we achieve to do, not because we don’t want to do the core thing, but because of all the small annoyances we associate it with.\n \nIf you—like me—ever skipped a work-out because you lacked the proper socks, had a bad hair-day or because it was raining and fuck if you’re going out in the rain, you know this all too well.\n \nWe should aim to minimise the friction and pain associated with creating a habit and maximise the friction and pain associated with not creating it.\n \nWe should strive to make training as tempting as possible, while avoiding it should be hard and painful.\n \nI floss, not because of my super-saiyan willpower, but because I’ve minimised the friction flossing creates in my life and head, while making the implementation of the habit as smooth and pain-free as possible.\n \nHere are some specific examples as to how you can create an environment where the habit of exercise is likely to prosper:\nPrepare the things you need beforehand.\n Have your gym bag with clean clothes, water bottle, towel, etc ready. Fill it with everything you need and put it by your door. It will serve as a constant reminder, telling you how close you are to go to the gym.\nSet a fixed time.\n Ever postponed anything? Yeah, me too. So why not schedule your training? By giving giving training a specific time and place, much like a deadline, we can making procrastination an as small a factor as possible. Put that shit in your calendar if you have too—it’s what I do for my studies.\nKnow where you’re going to train and become familiar with the place and logistics.\n Where is the water fountain? \nIs there \na water fountain? What equipment do they have? When is the best time to go? These logistics, while seemingly minuscule, can add up to a lot of friction and make it harder than it has to be to make this habit stick.\nHave a training plan. \nThere is a syndrome in the fitness industry popularly termed “fuckarounditis.” Fuckarounditis, while bad for progress, is also inherently unhelpful for making training a habit. Don’t just plan to go to the gym today. Plan to go, do X exercises for X reps/time with X goal in mind. If you’re going to the gym, with no plan and no particular goal you wish to accomplish, procrastinating on it becomes very tempting.\nSet some specific short-term goals and measure your progress. \nHave something you wish to accomplish every day you’re there. Maybe it’s lifting 1 rep more than last time, running a bit longer, or something as simple as improving at a certain movement. Mastery waters and stimulates motivation while incompetence kills it. Take advantage of that\nGet to know those who work there.\n You don’t have to be friends or anything, but make a bit of small talk. Say hi. Smile. Get to know the lines of their faces. A familiar smile is a lot more appealing than a strangers glance.\nMake your workout part of a routine.\n A popular tip I give is to train on the way home from work or on the way to it. The road from your coach to the front door can feel longer and more daunting than a marathon on pouring rain. Going by the gym when you’re already out and about is on the other hand often as close to effortless as it gets.\nGo with a friend. \nSocial pressure is real. Cancelling an appointment is a lot harder than postponing a workout in your head. As a bonus, camaraderie can also make training more enjoyable. Yes, it should be enjoyable too.\nIf all else fails, hire a personal trainer and set up sessions several months in advance. \nIn the business, we use this as a tactic because it minimises flakiness. While people may want to avoid working out, they also don’t like calling someone to cancel an appointment they’re paying for and know they should go to. You can use this too your advantage too.\nHave some fun.\n The best way to keep going to the gym is to actually enjoy yourself while you’re there. Experiment a bit. Find out what part of training is the most fun or at least sucks less. Too many treat the gym as a place of suffering. Counterintuitively, this makes it harder to go than it has to be. When you find something enjoyable about it, you may even find yourself wanting to go. In the end, that’s what makes habits stick. People who wake up at 5am in the morning don’t do so because they’re running on extreme amounts of willpower, but because they, crazy as it is, actually enjoy it.", "authorship": "human"}

Just make sure that push-ups are a part of your training everyday.\n \nSquats\n \nThe squat is another classic lifting exercise that is especially beneficial to the lower body. The exercise directly works the hips and hamstrings. It also indirectly strengthens your core and even your upper body if done with weight. Amateur weightlifters often times focus on their upper body and neglect the lower half. Don't fall for that. Any training regimen should work the entire body and squats are an essential piece. They're that good for you.\n \nDeadlift\n \nThe deadlift builds total-body strength. It's a gimmie for the best-exercise title, but it does come with risks. The wrong technique can injure your back, so it's important to keep it flat throughout the lift. When the deadlift is executed correctly it will strengthen your back as well as your calves, quads, hamstrings, core and forearms.\n \nThe lift is simple and with the proper focus and attention to technique it can be completed without injury. The goal is to pick up a weighted bar off the ground and bring it up to your thighs using your whole body. The completion of the lift will have you standing up, your arms straight with the weight hanging.\n \nThe deadlift is effective at building strength because the inert weight starts on the ground and must be lifted up in a controlled movement. The lifter doesn't have a chance to use any momentum, hence the \"dead\" name.\n \nSource: \nThe 7 Best Exercises for a Full-Body Workout\n \nThe 5 Best Exercises For A Full-Body Workout", "authorship": "human"}

The best option is the circuits in which four or five different types of activities alternate with rest periods between series and series . Coaches say that without killing themselves and choosing the activity table, the body will notice in 66 days.\nPlan the session; Exhausting is not a guarantee of good results\n \nWhat is better, to train strength or resistance? We are facing the eternal question when it comes to exercising. We arise because we have little time in day to day and we want, logically, to get the most out of our activity. But choosing between both is a wrong view, since it leads us in most cases to the mistake of hitting an aerobic bludgeon, thinking that with it we will burn more fats , or routines with a lot of weight in order to gain more muscle.\n \nThe reality is that people who manage to train continuously do so on average twice a week and no more than forty minutes each time . With this average, if we want to generate significant changes in our body to improve health and aesthetics, we have to change our perspective. By focusing one day on muscle mass and another on aerobic exercises, the stimulus to which the body is subjected is insignificant, even if we end up exhausted.\nThe reason is that the organism does not know if it runs in front of a lion to survive - and is making an extra effort for it - or if it trains for a healthy goal. So, if you are sitting for eight hours or so many hours standing up and suddenly an intense and unordered physical activity is imposed, your tendency will be to protect yourself. It will neither burn more fat, nor generate more muscle; on the contrary, it will try to reserve itself and spend as little as possible, in case the effort is prolonged in time. Your reaction is biologically logical.\n \nSo, what is the ideal dynamic? The answer is very simple: combine the two modalities in the same session or at different times but within the same day. The professionals call it concurrent training. However, after answering the first question, at least two more questions arise. The first: how much time is necessary to use to notice significant changes in the body? And the second: how to combine strength and resistance exercises in each session?\n \nThe magic figure: nine and a half weeks\n \nThe University College of London sets at 66 the days necessary to generate or change a habit or to achieve the goal that we set. You rarely get to the ten weeks of training followed. Most of us move by peaks of intensity. There are two periods that are key: the beginning of the year, when many people join a gym or start running; and towards the month of May, coinciding with the fact that the first hot days make us see summer around the corner.\nMany coaches propose that we divide our goals into blocks of 66 days. This will not only help us see results, but also motivate us with a goal that has a beginning and an end. Once you have made the decision, you have to plan the exercise with realism. How much time do I train? The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every week spread over five days - a half hour a day - or three sessions of between twenty minutes and one hour of vigorous activity .\n \nThis is ideal, however, the perfect dose is one that is compatible with the activities of daily and working life in the medium and long term. To achieve the goal, you have to be practical. Therefore, every session we take, even if it is ten minutes, should be used to the maximum and have all the necessary components so that our health improves little by little.\nA circuit with which we could start today would be this:\n \n1) 200 meters running or walking ;\n \n2) Ten squats;\n \n3) Eight push-ups.\n \n4) Six vertical jumps and return to run or walk 200 meters.\n \nWe should do it twice, with thirty seconds of rest between each exercise and two minutes of rest between circuit and circuit. The training lasts between twenty-five and thirty minutes.", "authorship": "human"}

Doing much weight training beyond that hurts us more than it helps us. We also know that 3-4 days per week are all that's needed to get the body of your dreams.\n \nSo, with all this new knowledge about duration and frequency of our workouts, we should all be growing like weeds with just those 3-4, one-hour training sessions per week, right?\n \nThis, of course, is not the case! Today, there are just as many frustrated lifters as there were 20 years ago, when gym rats spent 20 hours per week or more in their local box.\n \nMost\n bodybuilders hit plateaus, no matter how often they lift, because they don't want to change their routine—comfort quickly leads to fewer gains.\n \nUsing an old pre-season football strategy of two-a-day workouts—literally lifting twice in one day—is a great way to mix up your routine, giving you better muscle and strength gains while helping to slash body fat.\n \nAnd no, you don't have to be in the NFL to do two-a-days!\n \nThis approach is great for anybody looking to make awesome gains on a tight schedule because, as it turns out, two 30-minute workouts are actually more productive than one 60-minute workout.\n \nAdvantages Of Two-A-Days\n \nOne of the greatest benefits of doing two-a-days lies in the obvious—you're working out twice in one day and, hopefully, you're also eating two post - workout meals!\n \nBy working out twice, you get your protein synthesis and other anabolic systems racing. If you take full advantage of this by having two post-workout meals, you can start to see your gains skyrocket.\n \nYou will also find yourself able to train with more intensity.\n \nWhen faced with a full hour's worth of exercise, most of us subconsciously conserve our energy early on, so we don't find ourselves dragging through the latter portion of the workout. By splitting the total day's training between two sessions, intensity levels start and finish higher, which is key to new strength and muscle gains!\n \nAnd since you're fully ramped up for each workout, you'll burn more total calories than if the whole workout had been done at the same time.\n \nThe greater calorie deficit will offset the extra food being eaten, and the overall affect is more muscle with more fat burn\n \nHow To Do Two-A-Day Workouts\n \nTwo-A-Day Basics\n \nSome basic rules apply to all two-a-day programs.\n \nWhile you don't have to be exact with the timing, you need to allow at least six hours between the two workouts. If your workouts are much closer than this, you'll be too tired for optimal performance during round two.\n \nBecause of this, most people find it easiest to hit the gym in the morning before work and then catch another session after work. Going on your lunch break and then again in the evening also works well, as long as you've waited at least six hours.\n \nYou also have to make sure you limit your workouts to no more than 40 minutes in length, excluding the warm-up.\n \nAnd yes, it is very important for you to perform a proper warm-up and cool-down to speed up recovery, since you'll be back in the gym before the day is over!\n \nThe light, rhythmic exercise you get with a proper cool-down, such as 5-10 minutes of an easy aerobic activity like running, will help the heart to return the pooled blood trapped in the pumped-up muscles, speed up the removal of lactic acid and other metabolic byproducts, and allow the muscles to lengthen again after the chronic contractions of a good lifting session.\n \nYou'll quickly get tired of two-a-days if you're constantly fatigued, so a quick and efficient recovery is the key to this program's success.\n \nTwo-A-Days Should Be Cycled\n \nSimply doing two random workouts in one day will quickly lead to overtraining and burnout. There's a proper way to structure your program so that you meet the increased energy demands and take full advantage of this unique fat-burning and muscle-building opportunity.\n \nDue to the intensity of training, these programs are best saved for busting through plateaus, or for those times when you're extremely motivated to work out and the idea of going to the gym that much sounds appealing.\n \nTo avoid overtraining, two-a-days should be cycled—two weeks on, one week off—or you'll burn out and, alas, plateau—the very thing you'd hoped to overcome.\n \nTreat the two-a-day regime with respect, and it will respect you back!\n \nDesigning A Two-A-Day Program\n \nWhile there are plenty of ways to design your program, one of the most effective is lifting heavy in the first workout, then lighter in the second.\n \nThis lets you train your high-threshold muscle fibers—the ones with the most strength and growth potential—with a short, tough workout in the morning, while fitting in an evening workout that's easier but longer.", "authorship": "human"}

All these\"workouts\" may work great things for your health. They will keep your weight in check, improve your balance and range of motion, strengthen your muscles, protect your muscles, stop bladder control issues, and also ward off memory loss.\n \nIndependent of your age or fitness level, these actions are a Few of the very best exercises that you can do and can Help You to Get in shape and Decrease Your risk for disorder:\n \n1. Swimming\nYou may call swimming the ideal workout.\n \nStudies have discovered that swimming may also enhance your mental condition and set you in a much better mood. Water Resistant is another choice.\n \n2. Tai chi\nA combination of movement and comfort is perfect for the mind and body. In reality, Tai chi is a Chinese martial art that has been known as\"meditation in movement.\" Since the courses are offered at different degrees, tai chi is available - and beneficial - for everybody and every age and fitness levels. \"It is especially great for elderly people because equilibrium is a significant part of fitness, and equilibrium is something we lose as we age,\" Dr. Lee says.\n \nHave a course that will assist you to get started and find out the appropriate form. It is possible to locate tai chi apps at the regional YMCA, gym, community center, or senior center.\n \n3. Strength training\nLifting light weights will not bulk up your muscles, but it is going to keep them strong. \"If you do not use muscles, then they will lose their power over time,\" Dr. Lee says.\n \nComparable to additional exercise, strength training might also help maintain brain function in later decades.\n \nBefore beginning a weight training program, make sure you learn the appropriate form. Start mild, with only a couple of lbs. You ought to be able to lift the weights 10 days easily. After a few weeks, raise this by a pound or 2. If you're able to easily lift the weights through the whole selection of movement over 12 days, then move up to marginally heavier weight.\n \n4. Walking\nWalking is easy yet secure. Additionally, it can help you keep lean, enhance cholesterol levels, fortify bones, and keep blood pressure in check, raise your mood, and decrease your risk for any range of diseases (diabetes and cardiovascular disease, by way of instance ). A variety of studies have revealed that walking and other physical actions can even enhance memory and withstand age-related memory reduction.\n \nAll you will need is a well-fitting and inviting pair of sneakers. Begin with walking for approximately 10 to15 minutes at one time. As time passes, you may begin to walk further and faster, until you are walking for 30 to 60 minutes most days of this week.\n \n5. Kegel exercises\nThese exercises will not allow you to look better. However, they do something equally as significant -- strengthen the pelvic floor muscles which support the bladder. Strong pelvic floor muscles may go a long way toward preventing puberty. When many women are acquainted with Kegels, these exercises may benefit guys also.\n \nSqueeze the muscles you would like to stop yourself from passing gas or urine is the best way to do a Kegel exercise properly. Hold the contraction for a couple of seconds, then release. Be sure that you completely relax your pelvic floor muscles following the decrease. Attempt to perform four to five places every day.\n \nRaking the lawn counts as physical activity. So does ballroom dance and playing with your children or grandkids. Provided that you are doing some aerobic exercise for at least 30 minutes each day, and you also comprise two weeks of strength training each week, you may consider yourself a \"busy\" individual.", "authorship": "human"}

Spreading this out intelligently throughout the week will allow my muscles to recovery, adapt and ultimately grow.

A good starting point are the numerous BMR calculators available (I use the MyFitnessPal one) and then adjust based on the amount of activity you undertake during the day (I use my smart watch to give me guides).\n \nWhen I first started I was surprised at how much more I actually needed to eat to exceed the calories I was burning. Adding a protein shake between meals has helped get these numbers up.\n \nRecovery\n \nThe final ingredient and arguably the most important.\n \nIf you don’t let your muscles (and body) recover then it will not be able to adapt to the stimulus your workout has provided. Muscles grow when you rest so recover harder than you train. Prioritise your sleep and make sure you listen to your body’s needs.\n \nWhen your body is recovered your workouts can be executed with a greater intensity and that will ultimately be the most effective if you want to build muscle.\n \nSO\n…the most effective workout routine to build muscle incorporates:\nCompound Lifts executed 3 days a week\nCalorie Surplus - fueling your body more than it burns\nRecover - give time for your muscles to grow\nI hope that helps.

As these were the last few weeks before the election, a lot of the talk was about just that. I had my opinions on the candidates of course and with me being European, I would be naturally more aligned with Obama and Democrats. However I was very mindful that this was not my country and not my place to start heated discussions so I was careful to keep a neutral tone in my conversations. The demographics in the dining car of a long distance Amtrak train are quite old. There are lots of retired people who now have the chance to see America at last and they head out on a great Amtrak adventure.\n \nSo I was on the California Zephyr heading towards Denver from San Francisco and I went along for my evening meal. I'd had breakfast earlier in the day with a very ancient man who was convinced that Obama was a ‘'damn moslem’ and I was a bit nervous that I'd get him again. Instead I ended up sat opposite a couple in their mid 60s or so and eventually the conversation turned to politics.

The guy is referenced frequently in the media and by policy makers and is on TV giving interviews and graduation ceremonies speeches. I even saw a joint interview with him and Jay-Z one time.

I think my shock factor goes up or down depending on what a certain person does not know that I think they SHOULD know given their age, background, and access to knowledge via their language and modern telecommunication connectivity. Example: I do not expect my 7 year old niece to know basic ingredients for cookies, nor do I expect my 90 year old grandfather to know the different browsers on a computer, nor do I expect some random poor guy in the Central African Republic to name more than one U.S. president or any car company.\n \nLast week, I talked to a 60-70 year old white middle class English speaking American from a red state. She stated that she recently learned from a new friend that “there are two kinds of Muslims! I did not know that!” I mentally face palmed but said nothing. Never mind that there a 4 main branches of Sunni Islam, and various versions of Shia (12′ers and 8′ers), and also got Sufis, and offshoots of Shia such a Alawites, and other groups such as Kurds or Central Asians who might mix in certain customs into one of the Sunni branches. I wouldn’t expect any American to be aware of these nuances unless they were from the Middle East pr studying religion or something. I know I don’t have a handle on all of the variants either.\n \nWhat blew me away is the knowledge I expected her to have, considering her age and education and nationality. If you were of college age or above at the time of the USA invasion of Iraq in 2003 and present in the USA or near any English media, how could you NOT be aware of the Sunni vs Shia based breakup during the multi-year USA occupation?! Every day on TV and in the news paper, those two words were mentioned and referred to in any explanation about the ongoing armed conflict, civil war, and reconstruction effort. Every day for multiple years. Any half discussion on Iraq always includes those two words. Were my expectations too high for this woman to know that there were at least “2 kinds of Muslims”? That was an ignorant moment recently.\n \nP.S. on second thought, that lady might have been living overseas for a part of the 2000s and she is not the world affairs type and really doesn’t like any details of any conflict (domestic or intl).

This is because early in the morning is usually devoid of sudden commitments. Compare this to afternoon and evening workouts, when responsibilities may arise. Furthermore, a full day’s work can take a toll on our willpower, thus deterring us from going to the gym.\nBetter sleep\n: Since exercise increases heart rate and body temperature, working out too late in the evening (generally after 8 p.m.) may disrupt sleep. On the other hand, one study showed that working out at 7 a.m. (compared to 1 p.m. or 7 p.m.) may help people sleep more soundly at night.\nAvoiding crowds: \nFitness centers see the most traffic between 5 and 8 p.m., making it difficult to get the machine or group fitness class you really want. Mornings see less traffic, making A.M. workouts more efficient. Furthermore, early morning gym-goers tend to get in and get out within a fixed amount of time, leaving no room for socialization and clogging up the gym floor.\nStarting the day right:\n When you start a daily routine with exercise, you are more likely to set yourself up for a healthy domino effect throughout the day. Say, for example, you start the day at the gym. This is often followed by a healthy post-workout shake or snack and an increased water intake all morning long. Getting your workout in the morning makes it easier to incorporate a balanced breakfast into your schedule, setting you up for a day of healthy eating.\nWorking out in the P.M.\nStrength:\n If you are not a morning person, then you will definitely have more strength working out in the afternoon or the evening. After all, if you struggle to wake up in the first place, working out in the morning can result in the inability to concentrate (and injury!), which will decrease workout quality. On the opposite side of the coin, an individual who works out later in the day has the opportunity to eat and fuel his body for a tough workout.\nStress relief: \nMany people see exercise as a way to express their pent up stress throughout the day. Having an outlet, such as a kickboxing or personal training, at the end of the workday can provide a healthy way to release daily stresses.\nAccountability: \nIt’s generally easier to find a workout partner or personal trainer who is willing to meet you for an afternoon or evening workout than one who’s up for a 5 or A.M. weightlifting session.\nAvailability:\n While it is true that avoiding the crowds is a plus for many early morning gym-goers, the exact same reason can be a negative for other individuals. Gyms offer a larger variety of classes after work than in the morning hours. Plus, a packed post-work class may push you to compete against fellow gym-goers and work harder to get the most from your routine.\nWhat about RESULTS?\n \nIn terms of results, current studies suggest that \nworking out in the morning or in the evening can work just as well\n, depending on the individual. \nIt all comes down to workout quality and performance.\n \nAfter all, the advantages of working out in the morning vs evening all comes down to personal preference. \nThe most objective parameter is your individual performance\n. Other than that, no substantial research suggests that one is definitely better than the other.\n \nSo what should you do if you want to workout in the morning?\n \nYou should workout in the morning if:\nYou are a morning person. I.e. you feel energized and fresh enough early in the morning.\nYou feel fine working out in a fasted state. While you can still consume your pre-workout supplement, generally people who work out in the morning opt to have a proper breakfast after their workout session.\nYou should workout in the afternoon or evening if:\nYou are not a morning person.\nYour performance is impaired when training with an empty stomach. Indeed, most individuals find they perform better in the evening because they had a chance to get some meals in earlier in the day.\nDiscovering which one works best for you is easy: try both, and see how your body reacts in comparison.

Not someone who knows better and doesn’t care…not someone who should be informed and isn’t…someone who is literally *ignorant* (not knowing) about the broader world.\n \nFreshman college composition class, required for literally all students. Doesn’t matter if you major in chem or philosophy or women’s studies, you have to take this class. While it ostensibly focuses on basic college-level reading and writing (lots of writing to prompts, reading short passages and analyzing them, etc.), the TAs who taught it also took it as an opportunity to get everyone in the college environment engaged in critical thought about the world at large. The class met 4x per week, and every other Thursday we had a seminar discussion on an assigned reading…just a time to discuss and argue ideas presented, sometimes about controversial topics.\n \nOne seminar focused on an article that argued that countries with “biblically-based” (meaning the christian bible, largely the new testament, but with a lot of talk about the “10 commandments”…I KNOW…take what you like from the old!) laws suffered less crime than those with laws based on other philosophies. It was a fine and, actually, well-written article, but it was clearly assigned with the intention to rile up debate. Most of the students in the seminar said they disagreed with the article, citing the weakness of the conclusions (the author did stretch on what was considered “biblically-based law”) and ignoring certain societies that are less violent than, say, the US, but have certain laws that would go against the modern, christian bible (say, free access to abortion or civil partnerships for gay couples (this was long enough ago that only the Netherlands had, at that point, provided full marriage equality)). One student was sitting quietly and looking like he was about to burst at his seams as the discussion carried on, until the TA noticed, and asked him to share his thoughts.\n \n“I don’t know why we’re even arguing this. Everyone believes in the bible. Maybe they think that it doesn’t prohibit gay marriage or abortion, but they all believe in it. We’re just arguing what the 10 commandments mean, not whether everyone believes them. Why are we arguing whether biblical laws are correct? Everyone agrees they are, we just differ on what they mean!”\n \nTA: “Are you talking about the christian bible? The new testament?”\n \nStudent: “Yeah, all that stuff. Old and new. I know a lot of the old testament rules don’t apply anymore, but the basic stuff everyone believes in. The 10 commandments, love thy neighbor, jesus dying on the cross…everyone believes all that, so why are we fighting over it?”\n \nTA: “Would you be surprised to learn that most of the world’s people don’t believe in or follow the christian bible? Do you know anyone who’s jewish?”\n \nStudent: “I don’t think I do, but I know about jews…they believe basically the same things, but they don’t have christmas. It’s kind of like methodists versus baptists, right?”\n \nTurns out this student had grown up in a small town and had never met anyone who wasn’t a fairly traditional christian. He *literally* believed that everyone in the world was a christian of some sort. A jewish classmate explained to him the similarities and differences between christianity and judaism, an agnostic student explained to him how he had grown up with no religion at all, but had a vague notion of a “higher power.” Our TA found a muslim to come talk to the class about islam. And, a few weeks later, I found the moxie to stand up and tell the class about how I had chosen atheism (I was raised catholic). At the end of that class, a man who had never met anyone who didn’t share his faith traditions had heard from people who practiced several other faiths as well as none, and gotten to know us on a personal level in the process.\n \nHe was “ignorant” about the religions (and lack of) around the world, but, to his credit, was willing to listen and learn. When he first claimed that “everyone believes in the bible,” I found his ignorance stunning. But his grace in being willing to learn more was inspiring.\n \nAnd, yes, I do think this is a lesson for many people in these troubling times in the U.S. and elsewhere. We were stunned at his comments, at first, but heard him out, asked him to elaborate, and offered him the chance to learn. We didn’t shout him down and tell him he was wrong, full stop. He *was* wrong, but the path to getting him to understand that wasn’t ridicule and exclusion, but rather including him and educating him. And, of course, MEETING people in the groups he didn’t understand. Studies show that those who, say, are anti-gay-marriage tend to soften if not reverse their views once they meet and befriend someone who is gay. I can’t imagine this progression of views is that different when people meet and get to know someone who is muslim, an immigrant, etc.", "authorship": "human"}

My mother produced a card that said that my father was a British diplomat at the UK Mission to the UN in New York and that the UK government would indemnify any member of the family for any medical expenses incurred in the US. The clerk looked at the card and said, “I've not heard of this insurance company before!” She then proceeded to phone someone and it was one of those occasions when one could hear what was being said by the person at the other end.\n \nThe conversation went something like this:\n \nClerk: \nI have this card and it says the patient is indemnified against medical costs by the United Kingdom. I've not heard of this insurance company. Can you help me with it?\n \nWoman at other end of the line: \nYou know what Canada is? It’s another country. So is the UK. The UK is the country from which the Original Thirteen Colonies won independence.\n \nClerk: \nOh, thank you!\n \nDespite being in a lot of pain (I had pleurisy), I listened to this conversation in total disbelief. I simply couldn't believe that anyone couldn't understand and accept what was written on that card, particularly someone whose job it was to read insurance documents and understand what was and wasn’t covered.", "authorship": "human"}

We are living in a lazy society, so I understand when people disagree. Sitting on computer 8–10 hours a day is somehow okay, but working out everyday is apparently not, while the former is more taxing on your body. Where does this consensus come from? Simple, economy. Working out more than 3-4 times a week doesn't contribute to the economy. You can't draw more people to go to the gym, buy apparel or supplements if you promote daily exercise. You don't spend more money working out than hanging out elsewhere. So you will not only be told that you can achieve your dream body just working 2-3 hours a week, but also that your body cannot handle much more. Besides, gym time is still considered a waste, “why” they will tell you, “waste 6-7 days a week at the gym when you could exercise less and enjoy life more?“ Browsing on social media 3 hours a day is considered more normal. It has nothing to do with sports science, it is ideology.\n \nTell me which one is more taxing on the body: Lifting weights where you spend more than 2/3 of your time resting, or an NBA game? Athletes play up to 4 games a week, plus training, you think you cannot handle doing flys, curls, pulldowns, and basic human movements everyday? In all other sports, lifting weights is the supplement to the main sport, and the average gym goer believes s/he has to have full 3-4 rest days a week to maximize benefits and train hard, how pathetic is that? I know those other guys are athletes, it's their job, etc. But we are talking about the capacities of the human body. You can improve your work load capacity. I'm not saying that everyone can or should be an athlete, but an hour of training a day is nowhere close to an athlete's schedule. Athletes typically have up to 15 sessions a week, each around 2.5 hours. Ask olympic weightlifters and they will tell you. Even some bodybuilders, like Jay Cutler, have been known to train twice a day. One of the most respected academicians in sports science, Mike Israetel, also says you can train more than 7 times a week if you have the time and proper schedule that allows for it. Several months ago, he had three sessions a day himself. “Recovery,” in other words, can be handled pretty well.\n \nAnd now people will pull the “natural” card. It is actually the natural lifters who should train as often as possible to increase protein synthesis. You could get away with training each bodypart once a week if you were on steroids, but that's not the case if you are natural. Keep the sessions short and intense, stimulate your muscles and don't annihilate your joints, so you can train the same muscle group as often as possible. That will give you enough weekly volume to grow.\n \nAnd certain muscle groups can be trained almost everyday. Posture muscles (abs, traps), smaller muscles that won't tax your entire body and do not get heavily involved in big compounds (side/rear delts, calves, biceps) can be trained almost everyday. Bigger muscles can be trained 2-4 times a week. If you schedule smartly, it is perfectly fine.\n \nHere\n is a good example by Christian Thibaudeau.

I was doing my usual effort, standing around and looking pretty near the Coopers' store at Pennsic, as is my wont, being the sort of garb-horse with a penchant or propensity or something like that for off-showing.

But that's not important...yet.\n \nUpon hearing this, my heart soared. Saying to myself, \"Thank you God, I really need this,\" I smiled at her and said, \"Why, yes. You know it ends at the border, don't you?\"\n \nWith a whimsically astonished gasp, she said, \"Really?\"\n \n\"Oh, yes,\" I assured her. \"A long time ago, on the hottest day of the year, they walked the entire border and said where there was snow, that would be Canada. And where there was no snow, that would be the United States.\"\n \nPuzzled and bemused, she wrinkled her brow and said, \"Really?\" to which I replied, \"Yes!\"\n \nSensing an opportunity for more fun, I added that we all ride around on dogsled teams, for there is too much snow for wheels to work effectively. In the animated silence, I also added, \"Why, just to get here (Pennsic) I had to drive my dogsled team for two days, just to get to the border, and move everything from my dogsled to my car which I keep in storage at the border leaving my dogsled team with a friend there, and then driving on for two hours to get to Pennsic.\"\n \nWide eyed and thoroughly impressed, she exclaimed that that sounded incredible. (I wouldn't believe it for a second.) At this point, I thought perhaps she was having me on as much as I was having her on, but I didn't really think about it too much, as I often do this sort of thing to Americans, and don't really think much of it. Still, if she was, I'm sure we both had a lot of fun.\n \nAs is the nature of this sort of conversation at Pennsic, we were interrupted as other people came along wanting to ask questions about garb and this and that and the other thing. And so, the lady and I were separated, and I figured that was the end of it, and nothing more would come of it.\n \nTwo days later, this pretty young thing appears before my eyes, sporting a big grin, and says, \"How are your dogs?\"\n \nI looked down at my feet, back at her, and said, \"My who?\"\n \nBy explanation, she said, \"You know, your dogsled team that you left with your friend at the border.\"\n \n\"Ohhhh, them!\" I said in recognition. I shrugged my shoulders and said, \"How should I know?\"\n \nShe continued, \"You could phone your friend and ask.\"\n \n\"Phone?\" I said, as if searching my memory for some long-lost concept. \"Oh! You're talking about the telly-phone!\" Pointing at her, I smiled. \"We don't have telly-phones in Canada. It gets too cold, and the phone lines freeze and break.\"\n \n\"How do you talk to people over long distances?\" she asked.\n \nReassuringly, I clapped her on the shoulder, and in a calm voice, I said, \"Oh, quite simply. We use smoke signals. They may be kind of slow, but the message always gets there. Sometimes it may take a week to get a message across the country, but it does the job well.\" Again, I was thinking that she was having me on., but there was always the glimmer of faith in her eyes, and this did nothing but encourage me to continue. We talked more about snow. I told her we had several hundred words for different kinds of snow. Generally, I laid it on pretty thick.\n \nOnce again, we were separated.\n \nThat night, as with the first night, I went back down to the lake where I was camped, and visited over at Ealdormere Royal (then Principality) and shared with my fellow Ealdormerians the stories of my good fortune in encountering this lady... We laughed a lot. A very lot. After all, having fun with American minds is the Canadian National Pastime. Several of my friends came up with some very good ideas I might have used to expand on my fiction, but I felt that many of them were just too blatantly obviously fallacious. More on that, tomorrow night (the operative word perhaps being \"moron\").\n \nEarly in the afternoon the next day, others of my friends with whom I was camped (Americans), who had also heard the story, came to me pointing to the horizon in the south-east asking what they were saying. Looking where they were pointing, I saw dark smoke billowing up from beyond the trees. Realizing the humour of what they were asking, and the probable truth of what they were saying, I squinted my eyes and slowly, as if reading from a distance, said, \"Help...help...my...car...is...on...fire.\" Impressed all to hell my friends were when, later that night, we found out that someone's car had caught fire on the highway, and that that was most probably it.\n \nHowever, long before discovering that, up in the market area, I was visited once again by the Pretty Young Thing From The South. She said to me that she'd been telling her friends with whom she was camped about all the Canadian things I was telling her and that they were equally as impressed, for none of them had been as far or further from South Carolina as Pennsic. Thinking to myself, I just had to say, \"Lady, your friends are not your friends.\" But I also thought that she was pulling my leg too. So, without anything to lose and years of fun to gain I continued.\n \nSince she wanted to know more I said, \"I've told you about the snow, and all the names we have, and the dogs, but I haven't told you anything about the summer yet. We do have summer, you know. Two weeks!\" I exclaimed, holding up two fingers. \"Three weeks in a good year!\" (Adding another finger.) \"And Lord Tunderin Murphy, but it gets geezly hot, bye. Sometimes it gets up to 35, 36 degrees.\"\n \nA little taken aback, she said, \"My God, that's cold!\"\n \nAs quick as greased lightning, I said, \"Yeah, but it's hot enough to melt your igloo.\" and stroked my beard whimsically as if remembering.\n \n\"I suppose so,\" she said.\n \nNote:\n \nThe Truth about Wallpaper in Igloos\n \n\"Sure,\" I reply. \"And as soon as your igloo starts to melt,\" I continue with a dead serious look on my face, \"you have to get your wallpaper out immediately or it's ruined.\" I looked back at her with an honest smile, and she nodded her head as if it made perfect sense to her. So I went on, driven by this innocent, gullible face. \"So everybody takes out their wallpaper, and hangs it on the trees, and the fences, and the dogsleds, and the dogs,\" I said, trying to make it sound somewhat credible. I put my hand on her shoulder, waved my other hand across the sky, and exclaimed, \"And, my God, you've never seen anything so beautiful as the The Great Canadian Wallpaper Festival! You really must try to get up there some summer. Oh, the colours. Oh, it's just fantastic. Everywhere is light and colour. You really won't find anything like it in the world.\" (Especially in Canada.)\n \nShe gazed back at me with a face that was definitely too full right then...so I continued. Nothing is better done to excess than excess, that's my motto. \"Yes... This is also the time of year when all the young eligible bachelors tie their dogsled teams to their sleds and go cruising around town to see whose old man has got new wallpaper, and what kinds of dower rights you can get. These kinds of things really matter up North, because you really have to know where your wallpaper is. In Canada, wallpaper is almost everything.\"\n \nQuite dumbfounded, she just stood there and nodded slowly. Fortunately for her, some people came by with garb-related questions and anxious faces, and we were separated once more. Again I thought that that was it, that she would catch on, and there would be no more. But what great fun I had!\n \nNow, at this point I must acknowledge the assistance of others. There were many people gathered around. Some would occasionally put their hands on their mouths, withdraw from the circle, run off and laugh somewhere else. Most people seemed to make a good effort not to spoil my fun, and I really appreciate their efforts.\n \nThat night, back at Ealdormere Royal, there were many excellent suggestions for further story embellishment. Probably the most famous (or infamous) came from Kess, who came up with the idea of snow ants. Snow ants, which are of course snow white, and travel in huge packs, are quite invisible against the snow. Usually, the only way to know they're nearby is when moose disappear in a puff of white with a little spattering of red. There is so much more, but I will not bore you with it now. Suffice it to say that we laughed ourselves silly, well past the point where our sides had split. How fortunate were those who were wearing corsets! Of course, they couldn't inhale enough to laugh properly anyway.\n \nI think it was two days later, I ran into the lady again. She recognized me, and wanted to know more. So, I got my shovel ready and started to go. In response to her continued queries, I said, \"Well, I've told you about the short summer, the snows, the igloos, the Wallpaper Festival. There isn't much left. Oh, yes.\" I said, with a glimmer of recollection, \"we do have some permanent wooden structures. There are of course the Parliament Buildings, large wooden box buildings with pyramid roofs and shingles, but they're uninteresting and nothing ever really happens there. However, there are always the moose hatcheries. Probably they're the most remarkable structures in all of Canada.\" (This is where it gets laid on really thick.) I decided not to tell her about the snow ants, but instead to go with something slightly more plausible, like the idea that moose lay eggs. \"Now, a moose hatchery is a truly remarkable building. It's a large, squat, conical building rising up over the horizon like a great, shingled breast with a big door at one end, and a huge pile of sand inside. Some towns have many, some towns only have one, but every Canadian has seen dozens of moose hatcheries and very few have ever been inside one. For that's where the highest-paid civil servants in all the land work.\n \nNote:\n \nThe truth About Moose Hatcheries\n \n\"Once in awhile a moose will walk in from the wilds, usually to the same hatchery in which it was born, walk in the big doors, climb around on the sand pile until it finds the spot that feels right, squat down and pop out an egg the size of a football and then leaves. Moose are terrible parents, unfeeling and unkind.\" I looked at her and said, \"You should be very glad you weren't raised by moose. You'd be a much different person today if you were.\" (Maybe a bit smarter.) \"But anyway, then the hatchery attendants rush in and bury the egg. They turn it every now and then, make sure other moose don't step on it, and after 17 months, the egg hatches. Out comes a medium-cat-sized moose with little one inch antlers. And over the next few months, it gets bigger and stronger, and starts to feel the call of the wild. By the time it's the size of a German Shepherd (with longer legs) it walks up to the door and wanders off into the wild. Most likely, never to be seen again until it comes back to lay its own eggs.\n \n\"We don't know a lot about what they do, but we do know that they live out the rest of the season eating what they eat, and at the end of the season they drop their antlers and overwinter in a huge pack, all huddled together, waiting for the new season, when they get to grow the next set of antlers.\" My face filled with the look of nostalgia. I'm sure I looked as though I was about to wipe a tear from my eye, when she stopped me and said, \"Woah, woah, wait, wait. Are you tellin' me that moose drop their antlers and grow new ones every year?\"\n \n\"Well, yeah,\" I said. \"That is why we call them antlers and not horns, after all.\"\n \nTo this perfectly reasonable assertion on my part, she said, \"No, no, you lie. You are lying to me.\" Just for the record, I'd like to say that this is basically the first true thing I'd told this woman in a whole week, and for some reason, she didn't believe it. Also, though, I was afraid that I was gonna lose my fun, so I tried to rescue the situation, and go off on a ten-minute dissertation on the difference between horns and antlers, and that moose have antlers and that's how they work. But she just wouldn't believe me, no way, no how. And then, in a flash of insight, she said, \"Wait a minute, I remember from high school that moose are mammals.\"\n \nThinking that that may have been the only thing she remembered from high school, I quickly replied, \"The platypus is a mammal. It lays eggs.\" But she was not to be persuaded but I still tried for a few more minutes. Then, sensing that all was lost, I thought the least I could do was set her straight on everything. So I told her the truth about all of it. But she still would not believe that moose antlers drop off and grow back every year.\n \nWell, I like to think there's a moral to this story. Otherwise, why would I keep telling it to people? (Hee hee hee...) I'm sure you can come up with one or two yourself, but my personal fave is \"Sometimes the truth is even more fantastic than a lie.\" But I hope your moral to this story is not, \"Never trust a Tempus, ;)\" because most of the time, if you catch it unawares, a Tempus will be good to you.", "authorship": "human"}

She had no idea why Berlin and Germany were divided at that time, nor what had led to it. She had no idea what the Cold War was.

She was shocked to learn we’d dropped two atomic bombs on Japan (who she didn’t even know was involved in the war). She couldn’t see how any of this was relevant to the world or international politics at the time. To her, it was just long ago, far away, and completely unimportant. This is the type of voter who says, “I’m voting for candidate A because they’re cool and promise to fix all the world’s problems”… and her vote counts as much as that of someone who’s actually informed.\n \nA funny followup: A month later I was recounting this story to a neighbor and expecting a reaction from him along the lines of “Oh wow!

While many might argue over the merits of various toppings and spreads, I can confidently assert that avocado reigns supreme as my favorite sandwich ingredient.\n \nFirst and foremost, the texture of avocado is nothing short of magical. Its creamy, buttery consistency adds a luxurious mouthfeel that enhances the overall bite of any sandwich. Whether it’s slathered on as a spread, sliced and layered, or mashed into a flavorful mixture, avocado seamlessly integrates with other ingredients while still maintaining its unique identity.\n \nFlavor-wise, avocado boasts a mild earthiness that serves as an excellent backdrop for a myriad of flavor profiles. It pairs beautifully with zesty ingredients like tomatoes, onions, and pickles, perfectly balancing their acidity with its rich creaminess. Furthermore, it complements savory proteins such as turkey, chicken, or even bacon, enhancing the overall savory experience without overpowering other flavors. A sprinkle of salt and a dash of lime can take this ingredient to a whole new level, providing a fresh burst of taste that energizes the palate.\n \nOne of the most appealing aspects of avocado is its versatility. It fits perfectly into various sandwich styles—be it a classic club, a refreshing veggie pack, or even a bold and spicy sriracha chicken creation. Its adaptability knows no bounds, allowing it to be featured in both cold and hot sandwiches with equal success. Additionally, for those who prioritize health, avocados are loaded with beneficial nutrients like healthy fats, fiber, and vitamins, making them not just a delicious choice, but a nutritious one too.\n \nWhile some might debate the issue of ripeness or the daunting task of slicing the perfect avocado, the rewards far outweigh the risks. A perfectly ripe avocado can transform an ordinary sandwich into something truly special.\n \nIn conclusion, if you’re seeking to elevate your sandwich game, look no further than the humble avocado. With its creamy texture, versatile flavor, and health benefits, it rightfully claims the top spot as my favorite sandwich ingredient. Whether you’re crafting a casual lunch or impressing guests at a gathering, incorporating avocado will undoubtedly impress and satisfy—proving that sometimes, simplicity is key to perfection.", "authorship": "human"}

This will save you a ton of money over time.\nYou will be surrounded by other like minded, success oriented people at the gym in the morning.

(see chart below, -5.7% fat loss for full body, vs -2.1% for split group)\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885621/\nTriple the fat loss and triple the muscle growth? Sign me up!\nMore frequent \npractice \nwith the movements-that could explain why the bench results were very similar above (simple movement) but the full body group got better squat gains (more complex movement). They just had more \npractice\n.\nSorry…I just love that video.\n \nFull body routine disadvantages\nThey’re \nhard\n. This is BY FAR the main reason people gravitate towards bro splits. Mentally, going into the gym and working your entire body just is on another plane of existence in terms of difficulty compared to just working one chunk of muscle, even if the volume is the same. It’s easy to tap out when you have to do front squats, RDLs, bench press, overhead press, seated rows, pulldowns, lateral raises, curls, extensions and ab wheel all in the same day.\nPerhaps because of this, they can be tough on your \nhormone levels\n. Check the above chart; the full body testosterone went up 11%, but the split went up 21%! Keep in mind this was just four weeks, working out just three times per week, as well. Keeping up a full body protocol all the time, for higher volumes could \nprobably \nlead to reductions in T for some people.\nThey give you \nless time \nto \nrecover\n. This is part of the reason that I really am sure to use a lot of variety in my training when incorporating higher frequency. If you use the same movements all the time, be prepared for your joints to be unhappy. You need to vary the movement patterns enough that it shifts the stress on the joints at least slightly.\nSplit routine advantages\nMore \nrecovery time \nfor each body part between workouts.\nMight have better satellite cell activation (check the answer below) due to the \nincreased concentrated workload \nand greater \nmuscle damage\n. \nGeoffrey Verity Schofield's answer to How fast does lost muscle grow back with muscle memory?\nGet a \nbetter pump\n-doing more work in one session can lead to greater metabolic stress for that muscle.\nCan help you develop a better \nmind-muscle connection. \nYes, that’s a real thing, especially for the upper body.\nCauses increased \nsoreness\n, which can facilitate growth and let you “feel” that muscle better. This could be a disadvantage if you don’t like this feeling…I personally kinda like it for some twisted reason.\nSplit routine disadvantages\nLower frequency \nper muscle group. This is probably the biggest reason why split routines suck. You do chest on Monday (obviously), and your chest is really only growing for about 36–48hours afterwards. There are 168 hours of the week-why would you only have each muscle group growing 20–30% of the time? \nNot optimal! \nFull body routines can get that number up to 70–80+% for the entire body, which explains the massive difference in both muscle gain and fat loss.\nYou \ncan \nactually \nLOSE muscle\n. In the above example, you’re growing on Monday, Tuesday and maybe Wednesday. You might be maintaining on Thursday and Friday. But especially if you are cutting or not getting in enough protein, or not sleeping well, it’s entirely possible for the weekend to be in a catabolic state.\nNot that kind of Weaknd; he’s in a catabolic state 24/7\nYou can \nlose “touch” \nwith an exercise. This isn’t gonna happen with bicep curls or lateral raises, but with something like squatting or Olympic lifting, it’s entirely possible for the nervous system to slightly forget how to do these movements if you’re only doing them once per week.\nAll in all, I’d do full body \nmost \nof the time, but if you hit a plateau, splitting up your routine can be a nice change of pace.\n \nYou’ll have more time to recover, and can really focus on blasting a body part to force it to grow, perhaps through the aforementioned satellite cells. You can recover any hormonal or structural stress incurred during your full body bonanza.\n \nI’ve taken a page out of Eric Helm’s book\nand been doing full body workouts 4–6 times a week recently, and it’s been astonishingly effective. Tough…but the gains have been impressive.\n \nBut, I won’t do it for the rest of my life, as it’s not sustainable.\n \nCheck out my new \nSpace\n, \nfollow me on \nInstagram\n \nfor daily diet and training tips!

I never tried bikram, but hard-core classes like power yoga or advanced vinyasa flow made you sweat and toned and super freakishly flexible. I began jogging when I realized that my heart rate wasn't going as fast as when I first started, and weirdly enough it didn't feel like a work-out without breathing hard. \n \nThe first time I ran more than 2 miles was mind-boggling. And then I ran a 5k (on my own, not in a race and rather slowly), I literally thought I was dreaming and pinched myself. Compared to other avid runners, I'm quite slow, I average probably 10min/mile to 12min/mile depending on the day, but each time I hit another distance (like 5 miles, etc) or time goals (like 5k in 30min, etc), it hooked me. Of course I have days where I absolutely loath putting my running shoes, so I substitute yoga. \n \nOne thing that I have noticed with running more often for longer times and distances is that you can get extremely tight quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, gastrocnemius, essentially all your leg muscles and your abs. So I'm not as stretchy and yoga is actually a bit more painful (I appreciate wooden people's yoga feats more now), which in turn led me to more running.

They still squat, press and pull 3–7 days a week.\n \nWhat is the problem with split training routines?\n \nLet’s look at the concept. Basically the idea is that you train a body part, say legs. once a week, completely into the ground, you “destroy”, “demolish”, “annihilate” your legs, then rest for a week.\n \nNow, both research and experience has shown that first, most drug-free trainees cannot recover properly from such an extreme training session and that milder sessions spread out over the week work better and second, that the muscle building period after training in drug-free people is only 1–2 days and that they are then ready to train again.\n \nIn other words, you get much better results, at any stage of advancement, from squatting 3 sets Monday, 3 sets Wednesday and 3 sets Friday, than from squatting 9 sets Monday and resting for a week.\n \nNot only that, but you avoid the crippling soreness that you get from once-a-week training and feel fresher and stronger all the time.\n \nYes, advanced trainees sometimes train for 5–10 sessions a week and then incorporate some sort of split, but they still work each basic movement several times during the week.\n \nWhole-body does not imply that each session needs to be exactly the same.

I tried various kinds of diets such as ketogenic & carb-cycling. I achived different level of results with all.\n \nSo, based on my experience, I can tell you that there are many ways to achieve the transformation you want but you can't and shouldn't limit yourself to just three exercises. That's why I am including more than three exercises, but only those that are the best. If you can create a program around these\n \nten exercises, you will be making good progress :\nBarbell Back Squat : \nIt's\n \nthe best exercise for your lower body. If done in correct form, and if you go below parallel, it will work not only your quads but also hamstrings, glutes and core.\nDeadlift\n \n: \nAlong with squats, deadlift is one of the best exercise to build overall mass and strength. It targets your posterior chain including hamstring, glutes, erector spine & lats. Your core gets a good workout and it also improves your grip strength & forearm size.\nStanding Calves Raise\n \n: \nI do it on smith machine standing on step board. It's best for calves.\nFlat & Inclined\n \nBench Press : \nBest exercise for chest but also works your anterior deltoids(front shoulders) and triceps. You can also do pushups for same effect but you won't be able to use as much weight as in bench press.\nMilitary Press : \nBest exercise to target shoulder.\nBent Over Barbell Rows : \nGood exercise for lats, middle back, biceps & core.\nPull Ups & Chin Ups\n :\n \nBest exercise for lats & biceps.\nParallel Bar Dips\n : Best for triceps.\nHIIT : \nFor cardiovascular health & fat loss. Sprint for 30 seconds and then walk for 30 seconds. Repeat for total 15 to 20 mins.\nYoga Poses : \nFor flexibility & proper alignment of body.\nP.S. : I know Yoga is not a single exercise but I included it to put emphasis on importance of flexibility & mobility work. Other kinds of flexibility & mobility routines will work too.", "authorship": "human"}

His names Kyle and claims to be diagnosed with three cluster B disorders and thinks he is a “malignant narcissist.”\n \nHe’s an edgelord. Why?\n \nFor the following reasons:\n \n1.\n \nHe's been saying since last year that he's asked for a copy of his diagnosis and that he's going to get it soonish in basically every century long argument he gets into. And apparently, it's this spring that that he’s going to “segway” to YouTube. He has purposely been lying/saying these things for half a year. Only a naïve fool buys hi BS and has no critical thinking ability. He hasn't gotten his diagnosis. Because I doubt takes a year for a professional to get back to you (unlikely), or something complicated is stopping the process. But he would have just mentioned that by now, right? Kyle is just lying and purposely procrastinating over something he doesn't even have. No one should treat him as half as seriously as they do to every other poor sucker who tries to boost their credibility by lying out of their asses about being “diagnosed”. People who actually know themselves, don't need to wear it as a badge of honor to seek validation which subconsciously comforts their false beliefs.\n \n2.\n \nHe reinforced countless of times that ASPD+BPD males score 30+ on the PCL-R, so that he could receive validation for looking psychopathic. He's done this about 5-10 times on past accounts and wants people to think that he did. Really, if he actually did, it would have of been administrated and he wouldn’t need to so desperately reinforce this. After all, he is a repeat offender who is violent, right? Liar. Hey, anyone find it strange that someone who is so \"polite\" and who admits to having empathy for cats, could smash someone's head in with a crowbar? (As he claims).\n \n3.\n \nHe cares about animal cruelty (yet literally said dogs are scared of him because he's apparently \"evil\"). He obviously loves cats plus stands up for animal cruelty. This seems like a little too much empathy for a malignant narcissist he so calls claims to be. Why does he care so much if someone trolls him with dead cats? Even if he were a malignant narcissist, one would never react the way that trolls want them to and wouldn’t be affected by the trolling.\n \n4.\n \nHe literally had a pic from Wikipedia for the topic of narcissism, as his profile picture. He's just trying to appear more believable and is edgy. He also wrote this cringe ass answer regarding the history of when it was formed, it's like this image is his whole personality. Can you name one narcissist who cares about it being their image so deeply? Exactly. Edgelords have to try hard like he does.\n \n5.\n \nHe thinks that being low functioning and showing all of his true colours on Quora proves that he's credible. When in reality, he doesn't have proof of a diagnosis and therefore could be/is lying like everyone else who claims to be diagnosed. He doesn't have a diagnosis and the chance of being self-diagnosed is 50/50 like others he \"outs.\" Which means likely he is projecting about others \"self-diagnosing\" and he's probably envious they got more attention and recognition than him.\n \n6.\n \nDoes he have a cluster B disorder? Sure. Malignant narcissism? Three comorbidities of cluster B disorder plus Paranoid Personality Disorder and Sadistic personality disorder? Come on, think. Do you really think someone could have three cluster A disorders? No. Because there's too much overlap to make n accurate diagnosis. It's extremely unlikely anyone could actually have three cluster b disorders. There are too many similarities and overlap to be able to distinguish someone having three. It’s only possible to have two with overlapping traits.\n \n7.\n \nHe lies out of his ass. He obviously tries to buff himself up and look smarter than what he is by gaslighting his viewers into feeling they are dumb, by using big words he puts into wrong contexts/doesn’t know what they actually mean. His writing is sloppy and of a pseudo-intellectual. Honestly, he said he was going to get a PhD in history (obvious BS). Says he’s gonna get a diagnosis. Says he’s a malignant narcissist when he loves cats and has empathy for animals (too much for my liking). Says he was \"evil\" when he likes domesticated animals. Says he has paranoia when he was easily manipulated/lied to by a stranger on YouTube. Also, he says he was “banned” to look “cool” or “antisocial” when he has deleted his past accounts many times due to inadequacy and depression. You will find none of his old followers following any band accounts and the likelihood of them all unfollowing his past “banned” accounts is unlikely.\n \nHe’s a lying edgelord who projects that others are edgelords. Do us a favour, stop embarrassing yourself and delete your account.\n \nOh and Kyle, you’re not handsome.

This addiction started at the age of 13 when my father bought me my first weight set. I am currently 21 years old. In the 8 years that I have spent training, I've read dozens of books regarding training, read and watched thousands of videos in that time aswell.\nHere an some interesting facts about myself:\n \nI’ve performed over a million push-ups in my life.\nBack to your question about two days a week full body workout. Here's a excerpt from the book \nDinosaur Training: LOST SECRETS OF STRENGTH AND DEVELOPMENT.\nDinosaur training sessions are short, hard and infrequent. A typical session will consist of no more than twenty sets, with at least half of those sets being progressively heavier warm-ups. The average number of sets per workout would be between eight and fifteen. Some sessions will consist of only four or five sets. A typical week will see the dinosaur training only two or three times. That means the dinosaur trains his entire body with well under fifty sets PER WEEK. It also means the dinosaur will spend no more than three hours per week on his training. I refer to this type of training as abbreviated training.\n \nThere are two basic ways to implement abbreviated training. One way is to work the entire body in each workout. For example, you might train on Monday and Thursday. On Monday you would do squats, benches, pulldowns and seated military presses. On Thursday you would do HAMMER STRENGTH leg presses, stiff legged deadlifts, chins, dips and standing curls with a barbell. Thus, you are doing a total body workout every time you train, but you are doing different movements in each session and only working each particular exercise one time per week.\n \nThe second way to implement abbreviated training is to train each basic exercise only one time per week. and do only two or three basic exercises per session. For example, you might do squats and benches on Monday, followed by presses, pulldowns and dips on Wednesday, followed by deadlifts or cleans, shrugs and barrel lifting on Friday.\n \nIn either approach, the sets, reps and exercises are up to the discretion and personal preference of the lifter. Either system allows you to do high rep death marches with a heavy poundage ... to do five sets of five reps ... to do heavy singles ... to do rack work or anything else that strikes your fancy.\n \nIf you prefer to get more rest between training sessions, schedule your program over a ten day or two week period. For example, take two workouts over a ten day period instead of two workouts over a seven day period. Or train three times in two weeks rather than three times in one week. The variations are endless.\nJust to make things easier for you, here's a great schedule:\n \nDAY ONE\n (sets x reps)\n \n1. Squat 4x5\n 2. Standing Press 4x5\n 3. Bent-over Barbell Row 4x5\n 4. Farmer's Walk (one time)\n 5. Bent-legged situps 2x8-15\n 6. Auxiliary work for neck, biceps or calves (optional)\n \nDAY TWO\n \n1. Bent-legged Deadlift, Stiff-legged Deadlift, Power Clean, Power Pull, or Power Snatch 4 x 5 (or 5 x 3 for cleans, pulls or snatches)\n 2. Bench Press (barbell or dumbbell) (or floor press) 4x5\n 3. Sandbag Walk (one time)\n \n4. Side-bends 2x8-15\n 5. Auxiliary work as on Day One (optional)\n \nSounds simple, doesn't it? That's because it IS simple. Hard? Just try it.\n \nPerseverance, patience and determination will be repaid in untold wealth, health, strength, self-reliance and fortitude. \nGeorge F. Jowett", "authorship": "human"}

Ideally, it would have looked like this:\nBut a funny thing happened: if I had any kind of conflict at all, I skipped leg day. Board meeting runs late? Skip leg day. Get in an argument with my girlfriend? Skip leg day. Looks like rain outside? You get the idea. No excuse was too trivial.\n \nEventually, I realized that “leg day” - devoting an entire workout session to some of the most taxing exercises you can do - was psychologically overwhelming. So I moved to total body because it ensured that I worked legs and worked with my schedule.

You could set experience \novertraining syndrome\n, where your body cannot recover enough between workouts.\n \nAdditionally, your body requires a certain amount of time to recover between workouts. If you’re providing enough stimulus to your muscles this is usually between 36 and 48 hours (\ndepending on the muscle worked (muscles like your core tend to recover faster\n), your gender (\nwomen tend to recover faster than men)\n, the intensity that you worked the muscle (\nthe harder you worked it the longer it will take)\n, your age (\nover 60 you will require as much as 96 hours rest to recover between workouts), \nthe nutrition applied, and your hormone profile (\nmore testosterone, HGH, IGF will lead to quicker recovery when coupled with adequate amounts of protein and glucose\n)).\nIf you don’t give it enough time, you won’t build up past your initial baseline, and your muscles will suffer.\n \nAs metabolic fatigue builds up, even in lighter intensity training, you’ll feel it all over. It could be something simple at first — you stop improving in your lifts, for example. Eventually you start getting worse. Soon you start getting injuries that aren’t healing. You start to feel depressed. Even one day off with complete relaxation or even a light walk could be enough to clear you out, if you catch it early enough. Serious cases of overtraining could require more time.\n \nTo re-iterate:\nIf you don’t work it over 80% intensity every day\nIf you \ndo\n take a break once every 1–2 weeks\nYou’ll be fine.\n \nIf you notice things going wrong — you start feeling weaker, you stop improving, you start feeling like crap in general, you start getting injuries…take a step back. Rest. Recover.\nBrief anecdote as illustration\n \nOnce I was really working my pull ups. I was stuck at 18. I would do them daily, at least 4 sets. I hit 18 every time in my first set, I ended up doing about 50 a day. At first I was gaining daily, I went from 8 to 10 to 14, to 18…but then the growth stopped. I was stuck there for a couple weeks.\n \nI took 2 days off from doing pull ups.\n \nThe next time I stepped up to the bar I did 25 in my first set.\n \nI’m not saying that you’ll have dramatic results like this, but sometimes the missing part of your workout is actually \nnot\n working out.", "authorship": "human"}

Or use your watch to stop the time (you’ll try to beat the time you recorded).\n \nAs soon as you hit “start” and the clock is ticking, you’ll perform 200 push-ups, 250 squats and 100 towell pullups as fast as possible (with excellent form, obviously).\n \nOf course you shouldn’t bang out all 200 push-ups, 250 squats and 100 pullups all in one set!\n \nDivide the work up, so that you DON’T go to muscular failure on each and every set! That’s really important, or else you’ll burn out.\n \nWhat I do, for example, is that I do sets of 20 on push-up (so 10 sets per “round”), 25–50 reps on squats, 5–10 reps on pullups.\n \nFind a set and rep scheme that works for you. Again, you SHOULD NOT go to muscular failure in each and ever set. Keep 2–3 reps in the tank.\n \nWith that said, the key do these type of workouts, is to rest as little as possible (remember you’re doing this for time).\n \nI always hit a set of push-ups, immediately followed by a set of squats and then, without rest, I bang out my pullups. Then I’ll rest for 45–60sec. Only to start the next set.\n \nTrust me, your heart rate will jack the heck up on this routine!\n \nYou don’t have to run any additional cardio with this and you’ll develop a very “functional” type of strength endurance if you stick to it.\n \nOh, and you’ll also build some lean muscle! Especially if you haven’t used these type of “prison cell workouts” in the past.\n \nBut make no mistake…This is not for the faint of heart.\n \nIf you need help with this routine, then shoot me a DM or comment down below!\n \nAll the best and I’m rooting for you,\n \nMattis Rogers", "authorship": "human"}
