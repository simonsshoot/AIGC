Overemphasizing one over the other is also wrong as a balanced approach has to be taken. “Moderation” and “Consistency” are the keys.\n \nAll one needs is \nmax 1 hour/day\n which you should definitely be able to find. Based on my own experience and some literature and books I read I have tried to sum up the basics of these components below.\n \n1)\n \nStrength Training\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters :- \nFirst let us understand what it is not. It is often misunderstood as bulking up and building 6-packs ab and Salman like biceps for show-off. So most people feel that they don’t really need it. WRONG!\n \nIt is actually defined as a type of anaerobic physical exercise that by the use of resistance specializes in\n \n>\nIncreasing Muscular Fitness (Increases muscle strength, muscle mass and size)\n \n>Increasing Bone Strength and bone density\n \n>Increasing Tendon and Ligament Strength\n \n>Improving Joint Function\n \nApart from these benefits in aids in health improvement ,increases metabolism, aids in fat loss, overall fitness levels ,improved lipid profile (improves the good cholesterol) etc.\n \nHence it is absolutely critical component.\n \nHow you can do It :- \nOne has following options to do it.\n \na)\n \nAt Gym using various equipments\n :- You can perform it at GYM. All you need to make sure is that you need to have a good sensible trainer.\n \nYou may do it 2-3 times/week for an hour each.\n \nb)\n \nAt Home using Resistance band\n :- This is another option that you may perform at your home. You may order the band online (Cosco is a good brand),some good videos (10 min-30 min) are available online to learn and do the exercises along with the video. Convenience is better in this option but the drawback is that you won’t have good control on the exact amount of resistance. But it can be done on days when you look for some light strength sessions.\n \nc)\n \nAt Home using Body weight\n :- The 5 basic strength exercises – Push Up ,Pull Up, Dips, Sit-ups and Squats are key to overall strength. Rather than working on isolated muscles they work on large muscle groups. You may do these in conjunction with band/dumbbells or standalone also. You can also do exercises like Lunges, Mountain Climbers, bridges etc.\n \nd)\n \nAt Home using dumbbells \n:- If you know the basics right you may perform the entire exercises that you do on equipments in a Gym at your home only. You can do good variations with just a set of \n2 and 5 kgs of dumbbells\n using proper form and by doing the moves slowly. This can be started at any age by using a set of 2 Kg dumbbells and is often a most neglected part.\n \nDon’t forget to warm up before starting the strength training sessions. You may like to wind up with a 5 min stretching session.\n \n2)\n \nCardio Exercises\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters \n:- Cardio is any form of exercise/activity that is designed to work the cardiovascular system that raises your heart rate and breathing and consequently an increase in the circulation of blood and oxygen throughout the body for an extended period of time. Getting your body to sweat also helps you to release toxins that would otherwise build up in your tissues. The benefits range from weight loss, improved Heart health, improved Lung health, improved stamina, improved immunity, stabilized blood pressure,increased energy levels,more active and dynamic lifestyle, reduced mood swings etc.\n \nHow you can do it :- \nYou may\n \nenjoy any of the below/club them/etc. to get the benefits. Go for a variety rather than repeating the same all the time.\n \na)\n \nFast Walking/Light Jogging :- \nJust go to a park nearby and enjoy fresh unpolluted morning air, get some sunlight and do fast walk/light jog to start the day.\n \nb)\n \nTreadmill /Elliptical machine/stationary cycling \n:- Good for those rainy seasons\n \nc)\n \nCycling \n:- You may incorporate use of a bicycle to go to nearby places etc. or do it as a part of exercise weekly.\n \nd)\n \nSwimming \n:- One of the best cardio exercises. Just use googles and caps to avid the chlorine side effects.\n \ne)\n \nAerobic Dance Workouts \n:- In Youtube you have some good videos that you may see and do along.\n \nf)\n \nP-T exercises \n:- Remember the school days. Those exercises can still be incorporated.\n \ng)\n \nStair climbing \n:- Avoid lifts and take stairs.\n \nh)\n \nRope Jumping\n :- Good if you enjoy it.\n \n3)\n \nFlexibility Exercises\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters \n:- Flexibility may be defined as the ability of our joints and body parts to execute their full range of motion. Flexibility deteriorates rapidly with a sedentary lifestyle and without adequate flexibility you are more prone to injuries and with tight muscles daily activities become difficult to perform. We create body movement and posture habits which tend to reduce joint mobility. The benefits of flexibility exercises are less back pain, increased range of motion, injury prevention ,improved circulation, less stress, better posture and confidence. A flexible body a flexible spine ultimately leads to a flexible mind which is more adaptive . Practicing Yogaasanas daily is the most perfect and easiest way to obtain a flexible body and a clear mind It would help one to tone the muscles, skeletal system, nourish the body tissues and burn fat. It is excellent for all internal organs and various yoga asanas target specific parts and organs of the body like vertebra, Joints, neck, shoulder, heart, lungs, kidney etc. It will also improve your balance both physical and emotional.\n \nHow you can do it \n:- As I have already written above that YOGAASANAS are the most perfect way to flexibility.. You don’t have to do complicated postures at all , just simple basic stretching asanas have to be done with awareness of breath. You really have to be at ease during each posture and you shouldn’t feel any pain. One very good 22 minute video is that of a sequence called “Padmasadhna” which consists of 12 yogaasanas, it is taught in Art of living advance course but can be easily practiced by anyone. You may also learn asanas from any yoga instructor near your place, but you can learn simple asanas yourselves with videos.One video called Shilpa Yoga is also very well designed. Below are some common asanas which you can simply google :-\n \na)\n \nLying Asanas\n:-Ardha Halasana,Sethu Bandhasana,Naukasana,Makarasana,Shalabhasana,Bhujangasana,Dhanurasana,Kativakraasana and shavasana\n \nb)\n \nSitting Asanas\n \n:- Vrajrasana,Parvatasana,Shashankasana,Marjariasana,Vyaghrasana,Janu Shirshasana,Gomukhasana,Padmasana,Budhkonasana and Adho Mukh Shvanasana\n \nc)\n \nStanding Asanas\n:-Tadasana,Prishtasana,Padhastasana,Vriksasana,Natrajasana,Utkatasana,Trikonasana,Veer Bhradraasana,Konasana and Kati chakrasana.\n \n4)\n \nBreathing Exercises\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters :- \nBreathing exercises are basically an activity that would involve taking breaths consciously. Every emotion has an impact on our breath eg when we are happy and relaxed we breathe deeply, when we are in anger we automatically take short breaths etc. Now our motive is to control these emotions/feelings but we often find ourselves not able to keep them under control. The best way to achieve this is through control of breath ,when we do breathing exercises and learn conscious breathing we are able to control our emotions as well, it’s like a remote control to our emotions. If we observe ourselves there are two type of actions a) Voluntary b) Involuntary. Voluntary actions are the ones that we do consciously like talking, walking, moving our hands, eating drinking etc. .Involuntary actions are the actions that are taken care of by the conscious energy that resides within us like conversion of oxygen to carbon dioxide by our cells, digestion of food, pumping of blood by our heart ,all cellular actions etc. The thing with breath is that when we are not aware of it, it is involuntary but when we become aware of it and start breathing with awareness it becomes voluntary and we can control it. Hence it is a transit between Voluntary to Involuntary, Known to Unknowable, manifested to Unmanifested it is a jump into the divine. Hence breathing exercises or pranayama have found an unique place in our Vedas, yoga pradipikas, yoga sutras and more recently in Medical Science as well .\n \nOur lung function is obviously improved and more quantity of oxygen reaches and nourishes every single cell that restores health, youthfulness and cheerfulness.\n \nHow you can do it :- T\nhey may be classified as the nature of breaths we take\n \na) slow/deep/long breaths eg Anulom Vilom & Nadi Shodhan (Alternate Nostril Breathing), Deep Ujvai Breaths,3- Stage Pranayama, Simple Deep Breathing, Abdominal Breathing\n \nb) short/rapid/quick blasts of breaths eg. Kappal Bhatti,\n \nc) cyclic rhythm including a blend of both eg\n. \nSudarshan Kriya\n \nas taught in the Art of Living\n \n5)\n \nMeditation\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters :- \nMeditation is actually “Doing Nothing”. You just sit with eyes closed and just as a witness observe your own thoughts without judging without comparing without imagining, without labeling. It gives us deep rest, far deeper than what sleep offers you. Meditation makes you more Dynamic, more lively, more focused, improves your concentration, improves your happiness quotient, highly raises your healing power. Other benefits are\n \n>Keeps you stress free\n \n>Reduces aging\n \n>Helps you to appreciate life more\n \n>Helps you feel more connected\n \n>Improves Brain Function\n \n>Helps you give good sleep\n \n>Increases Immunity\n \n>Increases your awareness and attention\n \n>You gain control over your mind\n \nIn this 10 minutes you would realise that how our mind exaggerates and magnifies small problems in life and that you have immense potential to face all challenges of life. The most important realization that occurs is that actually \nno incidence or no person or no situation is joyous or sorrowful, it is actually the “SELF-TALK” that we do with ourselves is the source of joy/misery\n. After that even when situations come which tend to make you tensed/stressed by positive self-talk you increase the power of the self and don’t let the negative talks of mind over power you.\n \nWe develop love and compassion with others and let go of our habit of Criticizing, complaining and comparing.\n \nHow you can do it :- \nMeditation should be practiced daily for around 10 minutes. Some guided meditations are available online. You just need to listen to it and let go. You don’t have to do anything, just listen and relax. Initially guided meditations are beneficial, slowly once you get the basics you may not actually need them. You can simple sit and meditate. Just remember that it is not concentration, it is de-concentration.\n \nWe just have to make a schedule for ourself and then stick to it remembering that \n“ Self Discipline” is the only thing that makes someone miserable/blissfull,healthy/unhealthy,strong/week\n.\n \n6)\n \nA Balanced Diet\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters :- \nJust remember the basic fact that “You are what you eat”. You would need to get all your macronutrients (carbohydrate, Protein ,fat and water) and all your micronutrients (Vit A, Vit B Complex (B1,B2,B3,B5,B6,B7,B9 and B12),Vit C, Vit D, Vit E,Vit K,calcium,magnesium,iron,zinc,selenium,phosphorous etc ) in order to allow your body to function optimally. I would advise just spend an hour on internet and surf about these nutrients.\n \nHow you can do it :- \nFirst let us discuss about some basic points related to diet :-\n \na)\n \nMindful eating and chewing each bite till it turns liquid\n \n: - Eat mindfully with thankfulness and chew each bite at least 64 times that enhances digestion and nutrient absorption.\n \nb)\n \nAvoid\n all \nFried Products\n (Samosa, Vada, Pakoda, Papad etc.), All \nMaida\n products-Bread , Paw , Naan , Tandoori Roti made of Maida , Bakery Products , Maggi ,Noodles etc., All \nPacket\n Food- Farsana , Mixtures , Chips , Kurkure, Ready to eat products , etc., All \nFast \nFood- Pizza , Burger ,sauces, Junk Food , Hotel Food ,KFC, Mc Donald’s, Chinese Food etc., All \nFatty\n Food-Butter , Cream , Peanut Butter, Nutrilite , Mayonnaise etc\n \nAnd especially for phenytoin you have to stay away from all sodas and cold drinks also.\n \nc)\n \nRefined White Sugar\n :- This is the most dangerous food item on our shelves .It is rightly termed as “White Poison” by nutrition experts. Completely eliminate the use of refined white sugar. Date Syrup, Honey and Jaggery are better alternatives as they contain important nutrients , although they should also be consumed within limits as they have high Glycemic Index. Avoid All \nsugar\n Products- Sweets, Cold Drinks ,Chocolates ,Biscuits, Ice-creams, Pastries, Cakes, Tea, Coffee etc.\n \nd)\n \nFruits\n :- Include seasonal fruits a part of your daily food list. Definitely include Guava or peru (for highest Vitamin C), Awla (for highest antioxidants) , Carrot ( for highest vitamin A) daily. Additionally have fruits like pomengranate ,oranges,papaya,banana,apple etc. You should aim for 2-3 servings/day\n \ne)\n \nGrains\n :- Go for variety,don’t restrict you to just one.Ideally try to have one grain only once per day .Have wheat,brown rice,white rice,wheat,ragi,jowar,bajra,Makai.\n \nf)\n \nPulses and Legumes \n:- Select from wide variety of Moong,masoor,arhar dals etc and beans like kidney beans soya beans,chick peas etc as they are high in protein content.\n \ng)\n \nOmega 3 Fatty Acids\n :- Extremely critical to be included in the diet on daily basis. Flaxseeds, Walnuts , Fish and cod liver oil are good sources.You may occasionaly use a cod liver oil supplement\n \nh)\n \nAcid-Alkaline balance\n :- Almost all cooked food tend to have an acidic effect on the body. Try to include raw fruits and vegetables daily to restore the balance.\n \ni)\n \nSeeds and Nuts\n :- Include them daily in your diet plan. Remember to soak the nuts (including peanut ) as un soaked nuts have very high amount of phylates that interfere in Iron absorption.\n \nNuts – Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Dates, Raisins,\n \nSeeds – Flaxseeds, Sesame seeds(in winter) , Sunflower seeds, Chia seeds, Basil seeds , Pumpkin seeds.\n \nInclude some roasted gram (Chana), Sattu drink and handful of Sprouts in your daily diet plan.\n \nj)\n \nCooking Oil\n :- never use a single cooking oil all the time. Use a blend of cooking oils, have one for breakfast, another for lunch and another for dinner. Aim for varieties of which one is high in MUFA, one high in PUFA and one which has both in balance .Just see the labels of the cooking oil. Use olive oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, mustard oil ,groundnut oil, safflower oil, rice bran oil, coconut oil etc. and keep shuffling between them. The daily intake should be restricted. Ghee could also be used wisely in some quantity. The important thing to remember is that never eat FRIED foods and cook vegetables in less quantity of oil .\n \nk)\n \nAyurvedic Herbs \n:- Use herbs in medicinal form occasionally to boost immunity. Eg Tulsi, Neem, Triphala, Ashwagandha, Guduchhi etc.\n \nl)\n \nVeg Vs Nonveg \n:- Its totally a personal choice. Whilst Non Veg food are rich sources of nutrients like protein and iron they do have an array of drawbacks. One has to decide for himself. I benefitted hugely by switching to being vegetarian from part 3-4 years.\n \nNeedless to mention in the above list that Alcoholic Products, Cigarettes, Tobacco etc. are a Big NO! Remember that our body is the temple where God resides in the form of our soul/consciousness/energy whatever we may like to call it. We are all divine beings and this body is a precious miraculous gift from divinity to us, we should never disrespect it by the intake of such products. “We are not human beings on a spiritual journey , we are spiritual beings on a human journey” hence the best way to show gratitude to divinity is by taking care of your body!\n \nThe above components if integrated properly would surely raise the self-healing abilities of your body. Just have faith that there is a cosmic intelligence that has fine-tuned the entire universe eg. mass of electron, gravitational constant, electromagnetic constant, distance between earth and sun, composition of air that we breathe and millions of such parameters had to be exactly the same as they are for you and me to exist. Within our cells lies the same intelligence that is driving billions of galaxies. Each cell has the same intelligence by which it is able to perform such complicated functions with such an ease. Each cell in the body is like an universe in itself. This intelligence is working all the time within you and can definitely re fine tune the parameters of your body that have gone out of order. Just set your priorities right and you can surely manage one hour/day ,let these things be an integral part of your life like you brush your teeth, you bath these also shall be included in your daily routine.\n \nHope this helps,\n \nI belong to you! Thanks.", "authorship": "human"}

I was doing my usual effort, standing around and looking pretty near the Coopers' store at Pennsic, as is my wont, being the sort of garb-horse with a penchant or propensity or something like that for off-showing. Out of the South appears this pretty young thing.\n \n\"I hear you're from Canada,\" she said, nudging me with her elbow and winking one eye. \"And I hear you gots a lot of snow up there, eh?\" she continued with a slight but noticeable Southern drawl or accent, an accent I would later find out was from South Carolina. But that's not important...yet.\n \nUpon hearing this, my heart soared. Saying to myself, \"Thank you God, I really need this,\" I smiled at her and said, \"Why, yes. You know it ends at the border, don't you?\"\n \nWith a whimsically astonished gasp, she said, \"Really?\"\n \n\"Oh, yes,\" I assured her. \"A long time ago, on the hottest day of the year, they walked the entire border and said where there was snow, that would be Canada. And where there was no snow, that would be the United States.\"\n \nPuzzled and bemused, she wrinkled her brow and said, \"Really?\" to which I replied, \"Yes!\"\n \nSensing an opportunity for more fun, I added that we all ride around on dogsled teams, for there is too much snow for wheels to work effectively. In the animated silence, I also added, \"Why, just to get here (Pennsic) I had to drive my dogsled team for two days, just to get to the border, and move everything from my dogsled to my car which I keep in storage at the border leaving my dogsled team with a friend there, and then driving on for two hours to get to Pennsic.\"\n \nWide eyed and thoroughly impressed, she exclaimed that that sounded incredible. (I wouldn't believe it for a second.) At this point, I thought perhaps she was having me on as much as I was having her on, but I didn't really think about it too much, as I often do this sort of thing to Americans, and don't really think much of it. Still, if she was, I'm sure we both had a lot of fun.\n \nAs is the nature of this sort of conversation at Pennsic, we were interrupted as other people came along wanting to ask questions about garb and this and that and the other thing. And so, the lady and I were separated, and I figured that was the end of it, and nothing more would come of it.\n \nTwo days later, this pretty young thing appears before my eyes, sporting a big grin, and says, \"How are your dogs?\"\n \nI looked down at my feet, back at her, and said, \"My who?\"\n \nBy explanation, she said, \"You know, your dogsled team that you left with your friend at the border.\"\n \n\"Ohhhh, them!\" I said in recognition. I shrugged my shoulders and said, \"How should I know?\"\n \nShe continued, \"You could phone your friend and ask.\"\n \n\"Phone?\" I said, as if searching my memory for some long-lost concept. \"Oh! You're talking about the telly-phone!\" Pointing at her, I smiled. \"We don't have telly-phones in Canada. It gets too cold, and the phone lines freeze and break.\"\n \n\"How do you talk to people over long distances?\" she asked.\n \nReassuringly, I clapped her on the shoulder, and in a calm voice, I said, \"Oh, quite simply. We use smoke signals. They may be kind of slow, but the message always gets there. Sometimes it may take a week to get a message across the country, but it does the job well.\" Again, I was thinking that she was having me on., but there was always the glimmer of faith in her eyes, and this did nothing but encourage me to continue. We talked more about snow. I told her we had several hundred words for different kinds of snow. Generally, I laid it on pretty thick.\n \nOnce again, we were separated.\n \nThat night, as with the first night, I went back down to the lake where I was camped, and visited over at Ealdormere Royal (then Principality) and shared with my fellow Ealdormerians the stories of my good fortune in encountering this lady... We laughed a lot. A very lot. After all, having fun with American minds is the Canadian National Pastime. Several of my friends came up with some very good ideas I might have used to expand on my fiction, but I felt that many of them were just too blatantly obviously fallacious. More on that, tomorrow night (the operative word perhaps being \"moron\").\n \nEarly in the afternoon the next day, others of my friends with whom I was camped (Americans), who had also heard the story, came to me pointing to the horizon in the south-east asking what they were saying. Looking where they were pointing, I saw dark smoke billowing up from beyond the trees. Realizing the humour of what they were asking, and the probable truth of what they were saying, I squinted my eyes and slowly, as if reading from a distance, said, \"Help...help...my...car...is...on...fire.\" Impressed all to hell my friends were when, later that night, we found out that someone's car had caught fire on the highway, and that that was most probably it.\n \nHowever, long before discovering that, up in the market area, I was visited once again by the Pretty Young Thing From The South. She said to me that she'd been telling her friends with whom she was camped about all the Canadian things I was telling her and that they were equally as impressed, for none of them had been as far or further from South Carolina as Pennsic. Thinking to myself, I just had to say, \"Lady, your friends are not your friends.\" But I also thought that she was pulling my leg too. So, without anything to lose and years of fun to gain I continued.\n \nSince she wanted to know more I said, \"I've told you about the snow, and all the names we have, and the dogs, but I haven't told you anything about the summer yet. We do have summer, you know. Two weeks!\" I exclaimed, holding up two fingers. \"Three weeks in a good year!\" (Adding another finger.) \"And Lord Tunderin Murphy, but it gets geezly hot, bye. Sometimes it gets up to 35, 36 degrees.\"\n \nA little taken aback, she said, \"My God, that's cold!\"\n \nAs quick as greased lightning, I said, \"Yeah, but it's hot enough to melt your igloo.\" and stroked my beard whimsically as if remembering.\n \n\"I suppose so,\" she said.\n \nNote:\n \nThe Truth about Wallpaper in Igloos\n \n\"Sure,\" I reply. \"And as soon as your igloo starts to melt,\" I continue with a dead serious look on my face, \"you have to get your wallpaper out immediately or it's ruined.\" I looked back at her with an honest smile, and she nodded her head as if it made perfect sense to her. So I went on, driven by this innocent, gullible face. \"So everybody takes out their wallpaper, and hangs it on the trees, and the fences, and the dogsleds, and the dogs,\" I said, trying to make it sound somewhat credible. I put my hand on her shoulder, waved my other hand across the sky, and exclaimed, \"And, my God, you've never seen anything so beautiful as the The Great Canadian Wallpaper Festival! You really must try to get up there some summer. Oh, the colours. Oh, it's just fantastic. Everywhere is light and colour. You really won't find anything like it in the world.\" (Especially in Canada.)\n \nShe gazed back at me with a face that was definitely too full right then...so I continued. Nothing is better done to excess than excess, that's my motto. \"Yes... This is also the time of year when all the young eligible bachelors tie their dogsled teams to their sleds and go cruising around town to see whose old man has got new wallpaper, and what kinds of dower rights you can get. These kinds of things really matter up North, because you really have to know where your wallpaper is. In Canada, wallpaper is almost everything.\"\n \nQuite dumbfounded, she just stood there and nodded slowly. Fortunately for her, some people came by with garb-related questions and anxious faces, and we were separated once more. Again I thought that that was it, that she would catch on, and there would be no more. But what great fun I had!\n \nNow, at this point I must acknowledge the assistance of others. There were many people gathered around. Some would occasionally put their hands on their mouths, withdraw from the circle, run off and laugh somewhere else. Most people seemed to make a good effort not to spoil my fun, and I really appreciate their efforts.\n \nThat night, back at Ealdormere Royal, there were many excellent suggestions for further story embellishment. Probably the most famous (or infamous) came from Kess, who came up with the idea of snow ants. Snow ants, which are of course snow white, and travel in huge packs, are quite invisible against the snow. Usually, the only way to know they're nearby is when moose disappear in a puff of white with a little spattering of red. There is so much more, but I will not bore you with it now. Suffice it to say that we laughed ourselves silly, well past the point where our sides had split. How fortunate were those who were wearing corsets! Of course, they couldn't inhale enough to laugh properly anyway.\n \nI think it was two days later, I ran into the lady again. She recognized me, and wanted to know more. So, I got my shovel ready and started to go. In response to her continued queries, I said, \"Well, I've told you about the short summer, the snows, the igloos, the Wallpaper Festival. There isn't much left. Oh, yes.\" I said, with a glimmer of recollection, \"we do have some permanent wooden structures. There are of course the Parliament Buildings, large wooden box buildings with pyramid roofs and shingles, but they're uninteresting and nothing ever really happens there. However, there are always the moose hatcheries. Probably they're the most remarkable structures in all of Canada.\" (This is where it gets laid on really thick.) I decided not to tell her about the snow ants, but instead to go with something slightly more plausible, like the idea that moose lay eggs. \"Now, a moose hatchery is a truly remarkable building. It's a large, squat, conical building rising up over the horizon like a great, shingled breast with a big door at one end, and a huge pile of sand inside. Some towns have many, some towns only have one, but every Canadian has seen dozens of moose hatcheries and very few have ever been inside one. For that's where the highest-paid civil servants in all the land work.\n \nNote:\n \nThe truth About Moose Hatcheries\n \n\"Once in awhile a moose will walk in from the wilds, usually to the same hatchery in which it was born, walk in the big doors, climb around on the sand pile until it finds the spot that feels right, squat down and pop out an egg the size of a football and then leaves. Moose are terrible parents, unfeeling and unkind.\" I looked at her and said, \"You should be very glad you weren't raised by moose. You'd be a much different person today if you were.\" (Maybe a bit smarter.) \"But anyway, then the hatchery attendants rush in and bury the egg. They turn it every now and then, make sure other moose don't step on it, and after 17 months, the egg hatches. Out comes a medium-cat-sized moose with little one inch antlers. And over the next few months, it gets bigger and stronger, and starts to feel the call of the wild. By the time it's the size of a German Shepherd (with longer legs) it walks up to the door and wanders off into the wild. Most likely, never to be seen again until it comes back to lay its own eggs.\n \n\"We don't know a lot about what they do, but we do know that they live out the rest of the season eating what they eat, and at the end of the season they drop their antlers and overwinter in a huge pack, all huddled together, waiting for the new season, when they get to grow the next set of antlers.\" My face filled with the look of nostalgia. I'm sure I looked as though I was about to wipe a tear from my eye, when she stopped me and said, \"Woah, woah, wait, wait. Are you tellin' me that moose drop their antlers and grow new ones every year?\"\n \n\"Well, yeah,\" I said. \"That is why we call them antlers and not horns, after all.\"\n \nTo this perfectly reasonable assertion on my part, she said, \"No, no, you lie. You are lying to me.\" Just for the record, I'd like to say that this is basically the first true thing I'd told this woman in a whole week, and for some reason, she didn't believe it. Also, though, I was afraid that I was gonna lose my fun, so I tried to rescue the situation, and go off on a ten-minute dissertation on the difference between horns and antlers, and that moose have antlers and that's how they work. But she just wouldn't believe me, no way, no how. And then, in a flash of insight, she said, \"Wait a minute, I remember from high school that moose are mammals.\"\n \nThinking that that may have been the only thing she remembered from high school, I quickly replied, \"The platypus is a mammal. It lays eggs.\" But she was not to be persuaded but I still tried for a few more minutes. Then, sensing that all was lost, I thought the least I could do was set her straight on everything. So I told her the truth about all of it. But she still would not believe that moose antlers drop off and grow back every year.\n \nWell, I like to think there's a moral to this story. Otherwise, why would I keep telling it to people? (Hee hee hee...) I'm sure you can come up with one or two yourself, but my personal fave is \"Sometimes the truth is even more fantastic than a lie.\" But I hope your moral to this story is not, \"Never trust a Tempus, ;)\" because most of the time, if you catch it unawares, a Tempus will be good to you.", "authorship": "human"}

See a doctor.\nAnytime you want to start a new training or exercise program, it'll be a smart idea to see a doctor first. He will be able to tell you whether or not your plan is safe and appropriate for you.\n \nMake an appointment or call your doctor. Tell him about what your goals are and your exercise plan to help you reach them.\n \nAlso tell him whether or not you're having any joint or muscular pain in addition to having any pain or shortness of breath.\n \nAlso consider seeing a personal trainer. This is a fitness professional that will be able to help you set goals, design a plan to meet them and teach you how to do a variety of exercises safely.\n \n2. Set your goals.\nTraining your body is a fairly broad goal. To increase your chances of meeting your goal, you should work to make a more specific goal. Try using the S.M.A.R.T. goal system. Goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-Based have a higher chance of being an appropriate and reachable goal for you.\n \nIn addition, add in information about how you're going to reach your goal.\n \nSpend some time thinking about what you want to train. Do you want to just get in better overall shape? Are you training for a race? Do you want to build more strength or lean muscle? Do you want to lose some weight? How much? By when?\n \nAn example of a good goal would be: I want to run a 10 mile race in five months. I will run three to four days a week and increase my mileage by one mile every two weeks until I reach 10 miles.\n \n3. Start a journal to track your progress.\nRegardless of what you're training for or what you've set for yourself, tracking your progress in a journal may be a motivating part of your plan.\n \nWrite out your goals and your plan in your journal. This may help keep you focused and track.\n \nIn addition track your progress each day or week. If you're training for that 10 mile (16.1 km) race, maybe you write down how many miles you ran each week and how easy or hard it's been.\n \nYou can also keep a little calendar or chart of where you plan your exercise of the week or month.\n \n4. Join a gym or purchase fitness equipment.\nSome training plans may need a gym or specialized equipment to meet. Not all physical activity will need this, but you may want to consider what equipment you need to best meet your goal.\n \nConsider joining a gym. Many memberships are as low as $10 a month. Gyms offer you the ability to do most exercises inside. You can do a variety of cardio, strength training and even take classes. Even if you may not need the equipment at the gym, it might be nice to have the option to workout inside if it's a rainy or cold day.\n \nIf you're not a fan of the gym, maybe you could consider purchasing some at-home gym equipment. You can start small with just a few items like hand weights or resistance bands or buy more expensive equipment like cardio machines or home gym machines.\n \nPart 2 of 4:Training Your Body with Cardio Exercises\n1. Do 150 minutes of cardio weekly.\nThe Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend getting at least 150 minutes or about 2 1/2 hours of cardio activities each week for the minimum amount of health benefits. This breaks down to just five 30-minute sessions a week.\n \nStudies have shown that when people participate in 150 minutes of physical activity, they see a variety of health benefits including: decreased risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, weight loss, improved sleep and mood habits and even improved circulation.\n \nThe types of cardio activities that you can include for this 150 minutes can be anything from walking, running, biking, or doing a kickboxing class. However, the activity you do during the day (baseline or lifestyle activity) does not count towards your 150 minutes.\n \nIf you're just starting out with physical activity, one of your first goals may be to meet this general recommendation.\n \n2. Include both steady-state and interval training.\nThere are two main types of cardio exercises — steady-state and interval exercises. Both offer a variety of benefits, so try to incorporate both into your workout.\n \nSteady-state cardio are the activities that you do for at least 10 minutes and are maintaining your intensity. The goal is that you maintain a steady heart rate during your activity. For example, jogging for 20 minutes or using the elliptical at a steady speed for 30 minutes counts as steady-state cardio.\n \nSome of the specific benefits of steady-state cardio are: improved and faster recovery, maintenance of lean muscle mass, significant increases in cardiovascular and aerobic fitness levels, and immediate decreases in blood pressure and blood sugar.\n \nHIIT or high intensity interval training is another type of exercise that has become more popular lately. It's a shorter workout in total and combines both short bouts of very, very high intensity exercises with periods of more moderate exercises.\n \nThe benefits of HIIT differ slightly than steady-state cardio and can include: a more efficient and faster workout, increased ability to burn calories from fat and increased metabolism for eight to 24 hours after you've completed the workout.\n \nRegardless of which type of exercise you choose to do predominantly, it's better to do a combination of both HIIT and steady-state as you can reap the benefits of both.\n \n3. Increase your baseline activity.\nAlthough baseline doesn't come with as many benefits of steady-state or HIIT types of workouts, it's still an important part of being active.\n \nBaseline activity or lifestyle activities are things that you do on a typical day — walking to and from your car or doing household chores.\n \nThese activities do not burn many calories by themselves or increase your heart rate, but when you increase them as much as you can, over the entire day they do burn some calories and can help support your fitness levels.\n \nIncreasing your baseline makes your body function more efficiently in day-to-day activities (which burns more calories with less work).\n \nThink about ways that you can be more active or include more movement in your day. You could: park farther away, take the stairs instead of the elevator, take short walk breaks during your lunch break and stand or do light exercises during commercial breaks.\n \nPart 3 of 4:Training Your Body with Weight-Bearing Exercises\n1. Include two to three days of strength training weekly.\n \nIn addition to cardio, the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans also recommends that you include about two to three days of strength training or weight-bearing exercises each week.\n \nStrength and resistance training offers you different benefits compared to aerobic or cardio exercises, such as: it protects bones and helps prevent osteoporosis, maintains and can increase lean muscle mass, increase your overall metabolism, improves balance and coordination, and boosts energy levels.\n \nWeight training exercises can include a variety of activities including: plyometric exercises or body weight exercises, free weights, using weight machines, or doing yoga or pilates.\n \n2. Do a combination of compound and isolation exercises.\nWhen it comes to weight lifting or resistance training there are two basic types of exercises — compound and isolation exercises. Both offer different benefits and which one you choose will depend on your overall goal.\n \nCompound exercises are activities that recruit multiple joints and multiple muscle groups in order to perform. Examples of compound exercises include: barbell bench press, squats and lunges.\n \nThe benefits of compound exercises include: reduced risk of overtraining, less time spent overall exercising, increased gains in muscle mass, and increased gains in strength.\n \nIsolation exercises are those that only target one small group of muscles or use weight machines to target only one muscle group. Examples include using the bicep curl machine or seated tricep extensions.\n \nFor most training goals (even from basic to more advanced), spending more time with compound exercises is your best bet. Isolation exercises are best for fine tweaking once you have already met your goals.\n \n3. Choose to do a low or high set of reps.\n \nIn addition to choosing compound or isolation exercises, you'll also need to decide whether or not you want to do higher reps with a low weight or lower reps with a higher weight.\n \nHigher reps usually results in bigger gains in muscle mass, not strength. If you're goal is to build mass, include exercises that have higher reps.\n \nLower reps with much higher weights results in significant strength gains, not necessarily increased muscle mass.\n \nIt's best to do a combination of both high and low rep exercises. However, tailor this depending on what you're goal is (bigger muscles or increased strength).\n \nPart 4 of 4:Training Safely\n1. Warm up.\n \nBefore any type of workout, it's essential to warm up appropriately beforehand. Try to include even a short warm up before you exercise for the safest workout.\n \nWarm-up exercises don't have to be anything specific. It's generally recommended to do a warm-up routine for at least five to 10 minutes. However, the longer you plan on working out, the longer your warm-up routine should be.\n \nThe goal of warm-ups includes: slowly dilates your blood vessels in your muscle to help increase blood and oxygen flow, raises the temperature of your muscles for the best flexibility and efficiency, and it also slowly raises your heart rate which decreases the overall stress on your heart.\n \nWarm-ups are typically a slower version of whatever activity you plan on doing. For example, if you're planning on going for a run, walk for five to 10 minutes first.\n \n2. Take a rest day or two.\nAlthough it may seem counterintuitive, taking adequate rest days is just as important as the actual exercise. Without proper rest days, it'll be hard to meet any training goal.\n \nIn regards to strength training, rest days are actually when your muscles grow in size and strength.\n \nIf you do not take rest days, overtime, you will have poor performance and poor results.\n \nOn your rest days, try to still include light-intensity activity. You don't necessarily want to lounge around all day without doing anything. Ideally do some walking or restorative yoga.\n \n3. Stretch.\nA combination of adequate rest, warming up and stretching will put your body in the best condition for exercise and great results.\n \nStretching has been shown to help reduce muscle stiffness and pain when done appropriately. In addition, it can also help improve flexibility over time\n \nOther benefits of regular stretching include: better posture, increased blood flow, prevent back and neck pain, and improve balance.\n \nYou can do a slow stretching routine with moves like toe touches or you can take a restorative and stretching class like yoga.", "authorship": "human"}

It could be a story of dreams, friendship, hope, survival or even death. And every story is worth telling. But more than that, it’s worth living.\n \nPeople need stories. Stories of love, hope, survival, wisdom and sometimes pain. Maybe you don’t tell them the full truth; maybe you tell them lies. But what is this world? A lie in itself.\n \nNot the people but the mind, Not the storm but the silence, Not the answer but the question, Not the result but the reason, I am scared of. Not the real but the dream, Not the moment but the memory, Not the lie but the truth, Not the death but the life, I am scared of.\n \nTrust me, your struggle, your fight, will be worth the risk in opening yourself up. Get up. Inhale the air of passion. Start your journey. Grab your dreams. Enjoy your mistakes. Dance to the rhythm of your heartbeats. Smile. Laugh. Love. Live.\n \nIf two souls are destined to meet, the universe will always find a way to make the connection. Even when you lose all hope, certain bonds cannot be broken. They show us who we were, who we are and who we can become. Amidst everything, nature will always find a way.\n \n'There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.\n \nBehind every smile there is a frown. Behind every frown there is a story.\n \nWithin that story there was a moment of sadness, but with support from one simple person. We can change their fake smile into a true smile. Helping one another is what keeps others happy and reminds them to still have hope.\n \nLife has it's ups and downs. We cannot change the bad things that have happened to someone, but we can change the sadness they have within because of their past.\n \nLend a helping hand because no one should have to face the world alone. With the people in the world coming to join as one.\n \nWe should start treating one another as brothers and sisters. For if we do we can improve the love in the world.\n \nThere is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.\n \nLet your smile rise & shine.\n \nThis is my Life, This is my Story.\n \nYes. I’m a poor guy as far as my financial situation is concerned not with my Attitude or Goals.\n \nMy name is SURESH, I come from a very poor family background with Big Dreams. We used to live in a small village with a monthly income of Rs. 6,000.\n \nMy mother who is a tailor who is the only source of our family, she sacrificed her life for the benefit of our family development but things are not going as she used to think. I don’t want to talk about my father, though physically he is there, he is not contributing to our family in any way rather he used to torture my mother every time. He is completely addicted to alcohol. I had a younger brother who is completely deaf and dumb, this has become one more challenging task for our family.\n \nAs we are not financially capable, no one used to support us, including our relatives. I can’t explain my pain within crispy words. Nowadays, the so-called Vitamin M (money) is the only criteria for anything, you may accept it or you may not accept it.\n \nI’ve written IAS examination 3 times in a row but failed to clear it. Twice, I had my mains. But no result. As I’m zero at maths, I was not in a position to take any other bank or SSC examination.\n \nDay and night struggles, I’ve had my tears. Things were changed at my home, mother and brother got hospitalized. My father is not caring anything about our family. I came back I’ve taken care of my family.\n \nFailure and Impact :\n \nEverybody is used to point me, they used to show me as a symbol of failure. I may failed in my IAS examination but I’m not going to fail in my life. I’m a fighter, though I failed in civil services, I learned a lot from the journey. How can a single sheet of examination paper can decide my future? Everybody is Unique, right?\n \nNo contacts. No relationships. No money.\n \nApproaching the Politicians :\n \nAs I’ve had immense knowledge as far as administration and policy making is concern, I approached few politicians to work as an assistant to them. But got rejected everywhere.\n \nCivil Services Mission:\n \nI don’t want to mention the institution name but I found it. Things were going on my way. But here comes challenge again, I need to pay Rs.60,000 for my coaching. I had no idea how to pay.\n \nThanks for the Internet. I used to search on the Google for helping hands to support me, actually I’ve sent more than 2500 emails to different NGOs and trusts all over the India, including few persons individually whom I found on Google.\n \nI got few positive responses. Fortunately, I got support from them to continue my preparation. I paid the fee and I started working on my mission.\n \nPart Time Jobs :\n \nI worked in different part time jobs to survive myself. KFC, Big Bazaar, As a Counsellor etc…\n \nStruggles and Sorrows:\n \nI had only three pairs of dresses. If I want to go for coaching I’ve to wear the one dress for two to three days. I did all the Hard Work can do. My only ambition is to get into the civil services. No other exams.\n \nAiming :\n \nSo, I aimed big to wage a war against my poverty, I decided to become a Civil Servant, so that I’ll get recognition and fame. At that time, I thought, education was the only solution for me.\n \nMy Journey :\n \nI had no money to go and stay in Hyderabad. So, I’ve written Osmania University Entrance examination for my post graduation on the advice of my English Lecturer, actually my plan is to get shelter and then prepare for my IAS examination. By God’s grace everything went very well. I got good rank and I joined there for my post graduation. (For my preparation only)\n \nAshok Nagar, Hyderabad:\n \nI’ve no idea about the civil services examination, so I decided to go for coaching. I’ve had my search for the best coaching institution in Hyderabad, where thousands and lakhs of people are roaming around the Ashok Nagar cross roads in the name of IAS coaching. Actually, it is more than a business and business of business. I’m not in a position to cope up with big institutions where the crowd is so high. Then, I decided to choose the institution with minimum strength\n \nEntrepreneurial Journey :\n \nFormal education will make you a living but Self-education will make you a Fortune. As the start-up revolution is going in India, I had a question in my mind – why don’t I start myself as an entrepreneur?\n \nList of my failures :\n \nCivil Services Examination 1st attempt failure\n \nGroup 1 Examination Failure\n \nCivil Services Examination 2nd attempt failure (cleared mains, failed in personality test)\n \nCivil Services Examination 3rd attempt failure\n \nOne Indian Student, Failed to complete the book\n \nSipCup advertising company Failed\n \nWe Adopt foundation failed due to lack of funds.\n \nFailed to establish myself as a Personal Assistant to A Politician.\n \nMarriage-Money: Realities:\n \nAs a part of my Journey, I approached few marriage bureaus and even I advertised myself on the Shaadi matrimony, looking for some girl or family who can invest and ready to fuel & fulfil my dreams by supporting through money to establish my dream company.\n \nI've approached few, even if the girl is divorced, I'm okay with second match, if she had no kids.\n \n😂😹 My madness, the world has no place for Honesty & Loyalty, Money only matters.\n \nApproached few, divorced & 3 are elder to me around 32 & 34 ages. Their response: We don't care about story, all we need someone who can take care our luxury needs. That's all.\n \nI've approached friends & family members, who never believed in my vision, no support.\n \nI've approached my community people, leaders & some of the richest people in my community, no support.\n \nI've approached few IAS officers, Commisisoners, NRIs & Politicians, no support.\n \nTrying my level best to reach angel investors & venture capitalist via LinkedIn & every other platform, no responses are coming.\n \nI gave all my side but it didn’t gave me nothing beside. I gave all my efforts and it gave me nothing as a report. Of course success will hug in private and failure will slap in public. But neither happened to me.\n \nI tried… cried… dried… all myself !!!8\n \nNow???\n \nNow, I’m no longer in a position to write any examination or no longer want to work under someone. I want to become a self-made entrepreneur in any way. I’m not going to give up on my dreams.\n \n“If the plan is not working, change the plan but not the Goals”.\n \n“Body has it’s limitations but mind doesn’t “\n \nYour Help is Needed :\n \nI'm just trying to express my experiences to get some assistance from the Quora community,if possible.\n \nI would love to welcome your suggestions or advices or help or criticism in any way.\n \nI may not be the perfect guy to answer you but I can feel and express my opinion by stepping into your shoes in a perfect way.\n \nI’m not giving up rather I’m challenging myself to get what I want. I’ll persist until I succeed. For me, the true happiness always lies in Fighting.\n \nDisclaimer:\n \nAll these are based on my personal experiences only.\n \nI’m not promoting or marketing myself as a good person\n \nAbsolutely, I can openly say 97.75% I’m not a good guy\n \nI’m not a perfect guy, I’ll never.

Psychologist's call these people, 'Over-Motivated Underachievers' because they work hard (a prized cultural skill) but don't necessarily get anywhere because the body just can't handle high amounts of stress for long periods of time.\n \nThis is why phases are essential, your body needs rest to adapt.\n \nGenerally speaking most people can't tolerate high volume and high intensity at the same time (intensity is how high the percentage of 1RM any lifts are...1RM or above is the highest intensity), so you must balance the two. \n \nThis could be as simple as alternating between intensification phase and an accumulation phase (i.e. one phase is intense, low volume, high load - the other is volume oriented, lower intensity, higher volume, medium to low load).\n \nIt can be as complex as undulating sequences too, there are many components to neuromuscular training.\n \nDown weeks are also crucial here if you have high intensity or high volume training phases, allowing for supercompensation to take place is essential.\n \nWork + Rest = Success\n \n4 - Rest Changes\n \nThe less rest you give yourself between sets, between exercises, between training days and between training cycles, the harder it is on your system.\n \nThe more intense a workout, the more rest you need between sets and possibly workouts/phases.\n \nThe more volume in a workout, the more rest you need between workouts.\n \nManipulate rest to longer when you need it, and shorter when you want to challenge your nervous system in a new way.\n \nAgain - in phases.\n \n5 - Multi-Planar Adaptation\n \nThe problem with simplifying leg training to two major lifts is that these lifts often only address one plane of movement, forward and back (Sagital Plane it's called). \n \nYour muscles are 3-D, meaning you had better include some exercises eventually somewhere that require you to move laterally (i.e. Side Lunges, Lateral Sled Pushing, Shuffling, etc...) and rotationally (the transverse plane includes movements like chops, lifts, throwing, etc...).\n \nScientifically speaking, the body is capable of generating more power when engaged through all three planes (think of the amount of watts generated throwing a baseball or a shotput, it's significantly more than even a world-class squat or deadlift). \n \nDon't forget also to train unilaterally (one leg, like single leg squats, step-ups, lunges, etc...) as this forces the body into multiple planes of resistance.\n \nYou're leaving a lot of muscle untouched by training just two movements, or by using the majority of machines, and you're not refining your nervous system optimally.\n \ni.e. Single Leg, Single Arm Deadlifts challenge the body in all three planes. So would rotational rows, and standing position chops and lifts, among many others.\n \nSo would the majority of throwing activities, hitting activities, kicking (though more of the angular type found in soccer), etc... \n \nI'm not saying you should load patterns similar to your sport (you shouldn't, it's actually been shown to alter movement patterns to a point of decreased performance) but you should get out of the Saggital plane with your training from time to time and challenge your muscles as they are intended to be used, in 3-D).\n \nThere are a lot of good lifts at the gym that people either don't use correctly, or simply don't know.\n \n6 - Mechanical Loading Changes\n \nAre you lifting in your barefeet or in shoes, because the difference can matter to how your body responds. Barefoot will tax your feet/toes more than in shoes.\n \nThere are other considerations though, the overhead squat is significantly harder than a front or back squat because the mechanical advantage in the lift is reduced by the placement of the load above the head.\n \nPutting a dumbbell on one side only, taxes your body and your nervous system differently.\n \nPutting a dumbbell on the shoulders instead of the hands.\n \nA barbell instead of a dumbbell.\n \nChanging the angle of pull (wide stance, vs narrow stance) will change the outcome.\n \n7 - Threshold Considerations\n \nTraining the squat and deadlift all the time will train a lot of muscle, but it won't train the nervous system to respond to low threshold situations.\n \nYour nervous system is tuned to relax and contract at varying levels of intensity, so if low levels of intensity are out of whack (things like breathing, spinal segmental stabilization, etc...) your ability to fully engage at high nervous system thresholds is diminished.\n \nSo nervous system training kind of resembles a sliding scale from low to high threshold activities.\n \nIt seems a little on the 'girly' side (\nfor most men - while most women avoid the high threshold stuff\n) sometimes, but it's the smart way to train.\n \nEnsure that your body can tolerate body weight squats just as well as loaded squats. Basic glute bridges, just as well as heavy deadlifts.\n \nThese low threshold exercises are great for warm-ups.\n \ni.e. clamshells, quadruped lifts, plank variations, deadbugs, etc...\n \n8 - Range of Motion Considerations\n \nA quarter squat isn't the same as a full squat. The glutes and hamstrings are far more engaged in the latter.\n \nMobility training is important, and I generally encourage people to move through 'as full a range of motion as possible' when I'm coaching people. \n \nWork to improve your range of motion appropriately through all the major lifts, it will help a lot in your development at the gym.\n \nHowever, shortening up the range of motion can occasionally lead to break-throughs, and has it's place.\n \ni.e. you get stuck at the same spot on your bench press all the time, we can increase your strength at that point but employing a board press where you get stuck.\n \n9 - Addressing Weaknesses\n \nYou could squat and deadlift and hit a lot of muscle, but you'll plateau eventually.\n \nAt that point you'll want to start using accessory movements to push through them.\n \nIf hamstrings are the weak link then maybe we want to address them a little more intensely with romanian deadlifts or single leg romanian deadlifts, or glute ham raises?\n \nIf the glutes are the weak link, maybe we want to do some pull-throughs, or some loaded hip thrusts.\n \nIf the calves are a weak link, maybe we want to do some calf raises seated or standing, or some explosive jump training (which always lights my calves up...).\n \nUltimately, I'm missing some considerations for sure but the leg does the following movements worth training at some point:\n \nCircumduct the Ankle (rotation at the ankle)\nSupination and Pronation of the Ankle (Roll the foot inward and outward)\nPlantar Flex the Ankle (push foot down)\nDorsi Flex the Ankle (pull foot up)\nExtension/Flexion of Foot + Toes\nFeet Assist in Stabilizing the Ankle and Knee\nFlex and Extend the Knee\nStabilize the Knee\nExternally and Internally Rotate the Hip\nFlex and Extend the Hip\nADDuct and ABduct the Hip\nStabilize the Hip\nCombinations of all the above (the most likely and obvious training choices are ones that put your body through more than one of the movements above...)\nGood luck and enjoy yourself!", "authorship": "human"}

Being awake in the first place burns more energy, eating a meal burns energy, but they don't 'jumpstart' metabolism either. They just contribute to daily energy expenditure.\n \nThe same amount and type of exercise done at a different part of the day will essentially have the same effect on your metabolism overall.\n \nIt does generally improve mood and energy though. Especially at moderate intensities (aerobic exercise for instance).\n \n2 - Not everybody 'feels' energized \nall day\n from exercising in the morning (\nI certainly don't\n), the boost it provides to energy/mood is usually only as short as a few hours. It also takes roughly 3 hours for body temperature to increase to highly functioning levels anyway, so you might get an endorphin boost until temperature levels hit peak, that carries you through to the early afternoon (\nso a good portion of the day\n) but most people will still experience a lull in early afternoon (1-2 PM-ish), despite exercising in the morning. \n \nYou might actually do better exercising just before lull that to reduce it's impact. And for other reasons I'll get to below...\n \n3 - Exercise does increase memory retention and cognitive function, but these benefits are not limited to a window of 4-10 hours. Exercising in the morning doesn't increase this benefit according to any research I'm familiar with. Furthermore, you wouldn't be wasting those benefits even if there was such a window as most long-term memory retention and cognitive improvement benefits happen during sleep. \n \nRead \nSpark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain\n, but I don't remember it indicating such a window, nor any of the research I read following it up; If anything, closer to exercise would still be better for the several studies done on how subjects perform better on tests done very soon after exercise. The effects on the brain overall however, appear to stick quite well no matter the time.\n \n4 - If you work early in the morning, then it might absolutely be a problem to get up 30-60 minutes before that. I used to start my work day at 6 AM, up at five, technically when I should be in my deepest sleep, now I'm supposed to get up 30-60 before that? So 4-4:30...which means getting to bed at 8-8:30 PM to get eight hours of sleep, which is generally just after when circadian rhythm makes most people the most alert. \n \nFor anyone other than true larks (small percentage of the population), this is a very daunting task. Sure if you start your work day at 9 AM, getting up at 7 to do a quick workout before work might not be so tough and it might often be better for a lot of folks to get it out of the way before their day gets away from them. Mental fatigue from many decisions throughout the day can make it tough to get to the gym after work for A LOT of people, if it isn't already a routine.\n \nHowever, all of this doesn't make it the best or worst time to train, it totally depends on you the person. Your existing routines, your natural circadian rhythm bias (some are larks, some are night owls, most are in between), your work schedule, your family schedule, etc...etc...\nFor more details on how to discover something that works for you then I highly recommend you read these (disclaimer: My Blog...):\n \nHelp! When Should I Train? (Part I) - Skill Based Fitness\n \n \nHelp! When Should I Train? (Part II) - Skill Based Fitness\n \nFirst, generally speaking consistency matters more than anything else. So if you can make yourself more consistent by getting up in the morning and get it out of the way, then sure that would make working out in the morning better...\nfor you...\n \nThis still wouldn't make it better for everyone else.\n \nThat's first and foremost the most important thing; Training at a time that works for you.\n \nIt is easier for a lot of people to skip workouts later in the day and so working out in the morning does often work very well for a lot of people, \nbut physiologically that doesn't make it ideal. \nAnd it doesn't have to be\n immediately\n upon waking either, just enough time to get it done before you get into a lot of cognitive loading work that might later hinder your ability to desire to go to the gym in the first place. It's the same reason productivity gurus tell you to get your most cognitive tasks out of the way early in the day. \n \nActually there may actually be some inherent risks to training within the first 3 hours of waking, particularly if you are say lifting weight or doing explosive work. Less so for endurance/aerobic training.\n \nFrom sleeping all night (horizontal position), the fluid in your spine actually displaces, slightly destabilizing your spine for the first part of the day. This might be associated with injury potential (at least for heavily loaded movements involving the spine). Not only that but nervous system function, muscular blood flow, glucose metabolism and joint mobility at this time of day aren't really that conducive to training.  All of them are limited first in the morning, which is why most world records in sports are not broken first thing in the morning, they are generally broken in early evening.\n \nYou'd be hard pressed to find many strength or power athletes that successfully do the bulk of their training early in the morning (\nsome will start at 10-11 AM\n). There may be some early morning skates, serving practice or shooting practice, but these are usually low intensity and/or optimized to suit the schedules of student-athletes and break up the training day (\nfor twice-a-day training purposes\n).\n \nThis generally doesn't apply as heavily to the endurance athletes, who often have early start times to deal with mid-afternoon heat, but they would probably still perform better if it was done in the early evening (\nit would just be hotter out still in many climates\n). \n \nAgain schedules optimized to the person and the objective, not necessarily the physiological optimized times.\n \nA physiologically optimized (i.e. derive the most benefit from for performance purposes and anabolism) training window for most people (\ndepending on their circadian rhythm\n) is probably anywhere from about 2:30-3 PM in the afternoon (\njust after your circadian dip\n) to about 6:30-7 PM at night. \n \nYes peak circadian rhythm in most people is closer to 8, which is when you might be inclined or think to be ideal. However, training late generally makes it difficult to fall asleep for 2-3 hours post-workout due to hormone fluctuations, so the later in the day you push it the longer you might end staying up. I used to have volleyball practice from 9-11PM in school, and I could never fall asleep before 1AM as a result, which wrecked havoc on my school schedule.\n \nAgain, here \nI am\n speaking from a fairly pure physiological point of view, if you can't do that, or it impedes you from actually training, you're better off doing what makes you the most consistent. The differences are probably physiologically negligible (I'm throwing out a guess of less than 10-15% difference) long-term, except training first thing in the morning is actually pretty terrible for performance purposes (\nwhich isn't necessarily the same as training...\n). It would also probably increase training injury risk slightly for weight training/explosive training. \n \nIt would on the other hand make sense if you competed early in the morning, to move your training to early in the morning to acclimatize for your performances.\n \nTypically if performance is required or the intensity of training is high, wait at least 3 hours, and maybe even preferably six if you can. If it's just aerobic exercise, endurance, then do it whenever is convenient.\n \nThere are other influencers too. For instance if you have a high stress, high cognitive load job (lawyer, doctor, entrepreneur, technician, engineer, etc...) then you might be more likely to skip training the later in the day you leave it. If you have a lower cognitive load job (autopilot repetitive tasks, manual labour, factory work, etc...) then you might have the mental reserve to better tolerate training later in the day.\n \nUltimately, the best time to work out during the day depends on you.", "authorship": "human"}

This person would have to be my second cousin who just so happens to be American. Over the years she has provided me with ample material to supply a ready answer any time I’m asked about the most insanely inane and extraordinarily moronic things I’ve ever heard in life. I spent three weeks traveling around the Pacific Rim in 2006 and China was one of several counties I visited. While talking with this second cousin of mine shortly after the trip I was casually mentioning something about my time in Beijing that somehow (I don’t remember the exact detail) alluded to the fact I had breakfast at the hotel where I was staying, at which point she had to stop to interrupt me with her astonished (and astonishing) remark. Mind you, I’m not describing the reaction of a child, but the reaction of an adult. An adult who certainly never traveled beyond her own borders, but an adult homo sapien, all the same. She was so astonished to find out that people eat breakfast in China… As in— she was astonished, as in— she found it hard to believe that the concept of ‘breakfast,’ having a meal in the morning hours that is actually part of a routine and actually gets an official title for it as the equivalent of “breakfast.”\n \nLet’s stop for a moment to consider this mindset— and while meaning no cruelty or disdain for this mindset, I am okay having a little bit of fun with it.\n \nYou mean to inform me that breakfast exists in China? As in that super-far-away country with well over a billion people and one of the oldest civilizations in world history dating back to the Shang Dynasty around 1600 BC— they got breakfast over there, for real? No way!!! The same people who created the Great Wall and the Terra Cotta warriors, who gave us the I Ching, Taoism, acupuncture, not to mention all the tea— they were ingenious enough to conceive of having something like lunch or dinner in the morning time, like a whole meal to start the day? Like they really have breakfast, the real thing, not something just kind of similar? Are they just copying us? Is breakfast just another American implant over there like the Disneylands in Shanghai and Hong Kong? Or did these folks really come up with such a thing on their own? You mean to tell me the people who invented paper, silk, gunpowder, printing, the compass, the kite, the umbrella, and all that other stuff were actually sophisticated enough to think that having something like an ordinary meal in the morning made sense? How weird that people all over the world could seriously think of doing the same thing before noon that would involve food— and not just once as a fluke— but EVERY DAY. Wow. How do these things happen? Very interesting coincidence.\n \nI can only hope that maybe I was more astonished by her than she was by that. But I guess that wouldn’t be all too redeeming either…\n \nLike wow, you mean we don’t just do that over here??? People consume morning meals in other places around this strange world? Do they sleep and go to the bathroom too? What about the birds and the bees on that side of the world? Is it actually the stork for real over there who brings the babies or do those foreign people get to make them babies the same way as us folks over here?\n \nI could also mention that this same second cousin has said many other things to me that were spectacular in their own way and have left me stunned speechless in quite different scenarios yet similar outrageously vacuous terms. After divorcing her first husband and telling me about what happened, she explained to me that what really messed up their marriage of less than 2 years was her mother coming home to find my second cousin’s husband having sex with another woman. She made sure to clarify for me that with all the shock involved about this scandalous display of infidelity discovered in flagrante delicto was simply a bridge too far. You see the problem here for her wasn’t the fact that her husband was cheating on her. No, no. It was perfectly fine if he cheated on her anywhere else in the universe indoors outdoors upstairs downstairs in public or private with or without consent with a thousand different women from every country on earth so long as he didn’t do it somewhere her mother would see it, somewhere like her home. So the divorce sounded more like Mom’s friendly suggestion than her own idea. My cousin told me the guy she married was always cheating on her, but that alone wasn’t a sufficient reason to divorce him. Who would be so shallow to even think of such a thing? For such a minor offense, really. Sounds a bit like overreacting. Cheating couldn’t be anything more than like a misdemeanor in the marriage world, right? Now something like forgetting an anniversary might be a felony, but cheating? Divorcing someone over some kind of infidelity would be just like giving the death penalty to someone for j-walking.\n \nShe said while a lot of people had even gone so far as to suggest something like she should divorce the guy for being a habitual, unhindered, remorseless cheater, she didn’t see it this way from her enlightened perspective. I recall how she capped this off by saying, ever so glibly and almost in a huffy sort of way, without a whiff of reflection or even the faintest iota of critical thinking that could, you know, maybe randomly occur by accident: “Oh no, you don’t leave someone for cheating. You just work through it.”\n \nRight. It sounds like a small communication error after all, and can be fixed rather speedily. Maybe just start talking a little bit more between each of his short and maybe often extensive outings (vacations, cruises, Sunset Blvd, maybe a few Turkish style harems including sex sprees with his worldwide sprawl of liaisons).\n \nIn all seriousness, though, there does seem to be a somewhat intriguing rationale worth considering here. Nothing wrong with my cousin to be able to look at the bigger picture. Maybe if the person caused a genocide, divorce would be justifiable. Compared to that, infidelity seems a bit trivial. I mean, look at this way, as some mother might put it in her sage advice, or better yet, a Solomonic marriage counselor: “Yeah you’re married to a chronic cheater— but at least he isn’t Hitler or Stalin. He wants sex with more people in his life, but does that really make him such a bad guy? Look on the bright side, he’s not wanting to exterminate an entire ethnic group!”\n \nThis same second cousin also happened to make another noteworthy utterance the day of my grandfather/ her great-grandfather’s funeral. It was especially noteworthy because she said this to me that day and neither of us were actually at the funeral (which was out of state and I was unable to attend for various reasons) but actually just ran into each other by chance in the parking lot of the mall. I thought it was odd enough that the day of my grandfather’s funeral, when I felt sad about not being at the funeral where my parents and many extended family members were, I just happened to see a relative of mine from the same side of the family at the mall. Well, my second cousin had her own way of making this slightly, yet unforgettably odder. Naturally, seeing as how we just randomly ran into one another and it was the day of our grand/great grandfather’s funeral, that was immediately brought up… I think I just said something like, “Crazy about grandpa huh?”\n \nShe started off with, “Yeah, how do you feel about what’s happened with grandpa?”\n \nAt which point I said something, which I’m sure would be just about the same kind of answer as anyone would give about how they feel losing one of their grandparents… I could’ve messed with her and said, “Oh I feel great. Dead grandfather. It’s wonderful!” But no, I wasn’t in the humorous mood and said something sincere, like, “Oh yeah, really sad.”\n \nBut it was her response to this that really took me by surprise, when she said, “I hear he’s getting better.”\n \nI was too dumbfounded with disbelief to come up with any notable response. I think I just said matter-of-factly, “His funeral is today.”\n \nIn retrospect, a better (or funnier and more sardonic) response to say I gave would’ve been something like: “Really? You hear he’s getting better? Interesting. Cuz I was told he died and that the funeral is actually being held today and that my parents are actually up there attending it as we speak… Maybe I should call them and double-check. You never know, it’s possible someone lied about this.”", "authorship": "human"}

I’m going at it, gaining steam for a couple weeks, and then”\npoof,” \nmy momentum stops, dead in its tracks.\n \nJust like with you and training, I know flossing is good for me. I’ve seen horrific pictures of rotten, brown teeth and they scare the living shit out of me. I’m definitely motivated to floss.\n \nWhat makes my failures even stupider is that flossing takes little to no time and doesn’t require anything but the smallest amount of effort. I don’t even have to leave the house—I’ve had the same damn flossers in my bathroom cabinet since the Mongols laid waste to all of Eurasia.\n \nI have no excuses.\n \nBut I can’t do it.\n \nSo what gives?\n \nOne part of creating good habits is getting the ball rolling.\n \nBecause healthy routines are like a ball of snow rolling down a hill, steady gaining size and speed. It’s hard to get it moving in the beginning and the longer we do something, the easier it is to keep doing it. But this, while true, is also not helpful. “Just do it” is bad advice, because \nwe’re already trying to.\n \nThis view, of self-discipline=routines, creates a chicken-egg situation: to build healthy routines, we need self-discipline over a long period of time; but self-discipline is in itself a healthy routine, so how the flying fuck do we create that in the first place?\n \nAnother—often underrated—aspect of habit-creation is making the habit as \neasy to implement as possible.\n \nIt’s not about powering through using the self-discipline we wish we had, but creating \nan environment\n where a habit is likely to prosper.\n \nI’ve been flossing every day for 4 months now.\n \nI guess I deserve a medal or at least a diploma of some sort.\n \nWhat’s crazy is how the way I finally made it stick is so stupid and simple I can’t even fathom it.\n \nI put the flosser \nwith\n \nmy toothbrush.\n \nI was already brushing my teeth. I mastered that shit in kindergarten. Now, every time I do that deeply ingrained habit, I get an instant reminder to up my flossing game while I’m at it.\n \nI also bought approximately a lifetime’s worth of dental floss so I always have some available.\n \nBecause I know, If I have to go the store to buy some, it’s not happening.\nWhen we start doing something new and challenging, our identity and previous habits become this force of nature, pulling us back, to our previous selves.\n \nOur status quo.\n \nTo oppose those forces, we need to create our own force field, one which pulls us toward the habits we wish to create.\n \nI see too many people spend their whole existence in an epic fight to go to a dimly lit place and lift weights/and or run on a treadmill.\n \nWorking out shouldn’t be an epic battle.\n \nStupid as it is, we often stop doing what we achieve to do, not because we don’t want to do the core thing, but because of all the small annoyances we associate it with.\n \nIf you—like me—ever skipped a work-out because you lacked the proper socks, had a bad hair-day or because it was raining and fuck if you’re going out in the rain, you know this all too well.\n \nWe should aim to minimise the friction and pain associated with creating a habit and maximise the friction and pain associated with not creating it.\n \nWe should strive to make training as tempting as possible, while avoiding it should be hard and painful.\n \nI floss, not because of my super-saiyan willpower, but because I’ve minimised the friction flossing creates in my life and head, while making the implementation of the habit as smooth and pain-free as possible.\n \nHere are some specific examples as to how you can create an environment where the habit of exercise is likely to prosper:\nPrepare the things you need beforehand.\n Have your gym bag with clean clothes, water bottle, towel, etc ready. Fill it with everything you need and put it by your door. It will serve as a constant reminder, telling you how close you are to go to the gym.\nSet a fixed time.\n Ever postponed anything? Yeah, me too. So why not schedule your training? By giving giving training a specific time and place, much like a deadline, we can making procrastination an as small a factor as possible. Put that shit in your calendar if you have too—it’s what I do for my studies.\nKnow where you’re going to train and become familiar with the place and logistics.\n Where is the water fountain? \nIs there \na water fountain? What equipment do they have? When is the best time to go? These logistics, while seemingly minuscule, can add up to a lot of friction and make it harder than it has to be to make this habit stick.\nHave a training plan. \nThere is a syndrome in the fitness industry popularly termed “fuckarounditis.” Fuckarounditis, while bad for progress, is also inherently unhelpful for making training a habit. Don’t just plan to go to the gym today. Plan to go, do X exercises for X reps/time with X goal in mind. If you’re going to the gym, with no plan and no particular goal you wish to accomplish, procrastinating on it becomes very tempting.\nSet some specific short-term goals and measure your progress. \nHave something you wish to accomplish every day you’re there. Maybe it’s lifting 1 rep more than last time, running a bit longer, or something as simple as improving at a certain movement. Mastery waters and stimulates motivation while incompetence kills it. Take advantage of that\nGet to know those who work there.\n You don’t have to be friends or anything, but make a bit of small talk. Say hi. Smile. Get to know the lines of their faces. A familiar smile is a lot more appealing than a strangers glance.\nMake your workout part of a routine.\n A popular tip I give is to train on the way home from work or on the way to it. The road from your coach to the front door can feel longer and more daunting than a marathon on pouring rain. Going by the gym when you’re already out and about is on the other hand often as close to effortless as it gets.\nGo with a friend. \nSocial pressure is real. Cancelling an appointment is a lot harder than postponing a workout in your head. As a bonus, camaraderie can also make training more enjoyable. Yes, it should be enjoyable too.\nIf all else fails, hire a personal trainer and set up sessions several months in advance. \nIn the business, we use this as a tactic because it minimises flakiness. While people may want to avoid working out, they also don’t like calling someone to cancel an appointment they’re paying for and know they should go to. You can use this too your advantage too.\nHave some fun.\n The best way to keep going to the gym is to actually enjoy yourself while you’re there. Experiment a bit. Find out what part of training is the most fun or at least sucks less. Too many treat the gym as a place of suffering. Counterintuitively, this makes it harder to go than it has to be. When you find something enjoyable about it, you may even find yourself wanting to go. In the end, that’s what makes habits stick. People who wake up at 5am in the morning don’t do so because they’re running on extreme amounts of willpower, but because they, crazy as it is, actually enjoy it.", "authorship": "human"}

As a beginner, I had always wanted to build and maintain muscle mass. My ideal shape was athletic, strong.\n \nMy ideal shape was athletic & strong. I had aspired to look like this for a long time and lacked the knowledge and skills to move ahead with my plan.\n \nMy missing puzzle piece was training with weights. I was petrified!\n \nLike most females, I had fallen back into my insecure shell. I\n \nI would watch all these muscle men, with only a couple of women, \npounding, grunting and making faces \n(Actually, I was laughing at the facial expressions!).\n It’s still painful knowing in 2021, there are only a couple of women in the weights area. It’s still a space that men dominate.\nI admit, I was intimidated a lot and stuck to the usual weight bearing machines in the hope that some muscle would grow — and maybe I’d get some six-pack in the process, But that never happened, and my frustration continued to grow.\nTaking matters into my own hands was essential - that's why I invested in a personal trainer. It was great, but I didn't get the results I wanted. I didn't dedicate enough time to weight training or even structure my diet correctly.\n \nThat all changed when I decided I wanted to body build seriously and start showing my results on stage. That’s the scary bit — having your body scrutinised by judges and the audience. I didn’t care; I knew I could build the body I wanted. It was somewhere growing inside of me, and I just needed a proper coach — and to commit.\nThen and there, my weight training journey began, and it hasn’t stopped since.\nLearning new things on this journey never stops. There are always pit stops and pivots during the stages of ageing and hormonal shifts. Then when you throw lockdowns in the mix, things can get pretty heated. Here's is the best of the best during my 15-year journey of bodybuilding and nutrition.\n \nUse multi joining movements\n.\n \n(squats, lunges, deadlifts, bench pressing, pull-ups) to use the most muscle groups. These movements develop an athletic, shapely physique, burn more calories, strength and muscle mass. Using this technique every time you train will increase your results and get to your training goals faster. It has never failed me along the bodybuilding journey.\n \nDon't shy away from the intense movements.\n \nI see a lot of people disregarding squats, deadlifts and chin-ups. I know these are challenging, but throwing yourself into challenging movements will create successful results — and fast.\n \nThere are instances when your doctor doesn’t recommend a particular exercise — that’s fine.\n \nBut what I’d like to point out is that not using these muscle groups will produce weakness in your skeletal system, leading to problems in the future.\n \nI would follow my doctor’s advice, and if I can do something, I’d start very small. As you increase the weights you lift or the intensity of bands. Your body becomes stronger and will tolerate tension and load.\n \nDon’t allow injured muscles to become so weak that they no longer help you lead a normal life. Make use of what you can do to keep strong and active.\n \nNutrition is key to your success.\n \nIt doesn’t matter if you want to get leaner or build muscle — nutrition is your best friend. Assess your food choices, and adapt according to your needs. Those who want to lose weight will have different requirements than those who build muscle.\n \nOne big question I get is, \"can I do both at the same time?\" Well, sure you can, but one will outweigh the other. Too much cardio can lead to loss of muscle mass. Weight training more than four times a week can lead to less effective results & burnout - and worst still, injury. There needs to be a balance of both mediums.\n \nHow do you discover this balance? No one can tell you what works for your body better than you can. It's a matter of getting into the trenches, trying things out, experimenting and writing down your results.\n \nOver time, you will discover the dos and do not’s of your body. Unfortunately, there is no easy answer for this — it takes hard work and a lot of guessing — and it keeps changing as you age.\n \nLet yourself off the hook, throw perfectionism out the window, do your best, and your best is the right place to start.\n \nKnowing what to do and performing it correctly are two different things.\n \nExecuting movements with weights is one of the main reasons why I first hired a personal trainer.\nI wanted someone to tell me exactly what I should do and how to structure my posture correctly.\nI tried to get specific results, and it was easy to get the skills from a person who was already way ahead in the game.\n \nI applied their techniques and skills. Over time, I trained with a couple of other experts who brought even more skills for my success.\n \nThe easiest way to master weight training was because I asked for help. If I had done it myself, it wouldn’t have happened.\n \nThe journey ahead never ends\n.\n \nThere will be endless points in your life where the journey changes.\nWe start to age, we change professions, have a family, experience hormonal shifts or develop an illness.\nThese issues can be very frustrating to anyone that has trained for many years. Things we did ten years ago don't work today.\n \nBut this is life telling us we need to change, alter and find a different way.\n \nThat could mean training a lot less, recovering more, watching your nutrition like a hawk, or trying intermittent fasting. The alternatives are endless, but start with one thing at a time and wait. Along my bodybuilding journey, I ate 5 -6 meals a day.\n \nBack then, I was about 35. Now at 42, I can't handle that many meals, and I'm just not as hungry as I once was. So we just have to make do with what is presented to us right now.\n \nI want to finish this off by saying that when you have a goal In mind, you will then look for the means to attract those results. I always had a set idea of what I wanted.\n \nOnce you've achieved your goal, moving on to something else will keep the flame of fitness alive.\n \nAs we grow up, we develop a love for other things. Perhaps for you, it may be pushing your body to its limit.\n \nMaybe someone else might decide to take up yoga as well. The remarkable aspect of fitness, no matter what age, you can try an array of things to find out what starts to ignite an emotional trigger within you. For me, that's always been weight training.\n \nThere is no other form of exercise that ticks all the boxes for my needs, wants and wishes.\n \nWhat will yours be?\n \nPlease also join me on my various social platforms and do go ahead and download your \n40 Fat Loss Tips & Portions guide.\n I'm also on \nInstagram\n & \nMedium", "authorship": "human"}

And I don't want to hurt your feelings. I respect that \nyou\n believe what you believe. I just don't see eye-to-eye with you.\n \nAs for the rest of you who are still here, I'll get to describing the venue:\n \nThe Reverend had rented a large community center/gymnasium out in a rural area, beyond the subdivisions and where the busses stopped running after dark.\n \nIt was in Chico, California. At that time, Playboy magazine had named it college party city #1 in the USA, so I was a bit worried about how I was going to find my way back into town, in the dark, when I was at\n “ground zero”\n with all the \nfreaks\n in town.\n \nI entered the building. I was early, with plenty of time to kill, as I'd taken the last bus out on the route, and it was still two hours 'til “show time.”\n \nI was met at a reception table\n,\n and asked to fill out an information card.\n \nIt asked my name, address, ailments, worries, how many children I had, financial status, and basically all the information any reasonably “psychic” faith healer would need to know about a person in order to pull off a convincing show.\n \nA-HA! Gotcha!\n \nI got my seat assignment and sat down.\n \nFront row. Next to a nice old couple. She, in a wheelchair. We had a couple hours to shoot the breeze as the room filled up.\n \nNice folks.\n \nAt one point she needed to use the facilities and asked that I wheel her to the Ladies Room.\n \nI obliged.\n \nRelieved, I watched her get up and \nwalk\n out of her chair\n,\n and enter the stall. At one point I worried I might have to go in there with her and help her out, but she was fine on her own.\n \nShe could walk.\n \nThe show started right on time.\n \nThe Reverend Saul David was introduced, as the band geared up and played some \nwonderful\n gospel tunes and he danced around, waving his arms, bobbing his blonde head, smiling (even as his eyebrows were scowling in a creepy way) and everybody clapped their hands and praised Jesus. That was the fun part!\n \nThe music was \ndelicious\n. Rich. Inspiring. I'm still a fan of gospel and learned a lot of technique that night. You wouldn't know if you heard me play piano, that I wasn't raised a Southern Baptist. I took to the style like a duck to water. It exudes essence, and soul, and truly touches me. I love the music!\n \nBut then the music \nstopped\n.\n \nThe fun ended. I suddenly found myself being held hostage for \nhours\n. A lot of \nboring\n talking.\n Preaching. Fire and Brimstone.\n \nBlah blah blah. \nMy eyes glazed over. I wanted to leave, but like I said, I was in the middle of nowhere, way out of town. It was dark, and I really didn't know exactly where I was.\n \nThe freakiest part of the evening came when the good 'ol Rev started picking people out of the audience.\n \n“There is someone here,” he began, “someone who recently lost a son. And God wants you to know, \nSully\n, that \nTony\n is beside him in Heaven and is just fine.”\n \nAnd Sully would whoop and weep. Relieved that his kid was okay in the Afterlife.\n \n“Someone here has been suffering from arthritis. \nLily\n has owned a bakery for years and can no longer knead her bread!”\n \nAt which point, my seat neighbor, the one I'd taken to the Lady's room, let out a startled gasp, and put her hand over her lips in astonishment! She was eating that stuff up.\n \nThe Reverend made his way over to our row and grabbed onto the old woman's head and started speaking gibberish, \n“Loobagoda Brigga Nighga Shwopa-fumanigha poo Veggie lool roog bon FWEEEEEE!”\n \n(My eyes went wide. I was suddenly frightened.)\n \n“IN THE NAME OF JEEEZUS-AH, YOU WILL BE HEEEEELED, NOWA! Stand up and WALK!” \nHe \nscreamed\n directly into her face, and I watched, bird's eye view, as \nspittle\n flew from his mouth, into her open eyes and drenched her face.\n \nShe was weeping as she stood, wobbly at first, then raising her arms started walking up and down the aisles!\n \nThe congregation erupted. Talking in tongues, arms raised, standing, stomping\n,\n as the organ chimed in and accompanied such an amazing “\nmiracle” \ntaking place!\n \nThe Reverend took her wheelchair\n,\n and kicked it, \nactually kicked it, \naway (I was hoping the old lady got it back later.)\n \nOh, the tears did flow!\n \nAt the end of the evening, the Reverend, tired of making fake predictions by getting information fed to him in his secreted earpiece from the cards we'd filled out before the “show” started, had us all line up and went down the queue, “healing” us one-by-one.\n \nHe was grabbing heads and \nliterally\n pushing people backwards into the arms of his assistants. When he got to me I didn't fall over, I \nresisted, held my ground\n and I laughed in his face.\n \nHe looked pissed off.\n \nLuckily, he didn't point out I was possessed by the devil or anything, or I might have been torn to shreds by the fanatics in that room!\n \nFinally, after four hours of exhausting bullshit, it was over.\n \nPeople were gladly handing over a good portion of their paychecks at the reception table as they filed out of the room.\n \nLeaving the show, I ended up collecting my jacket from my seat. I met the old couple there, and said farewell.\n \nI watched them as they slowly began to walk away, the husband escorting his fragile wife as she painfully took each step and leaned heavily on his arm.\n \n“Don't you want your wheelchair?” I asked, as I pointed to it, still sitting in the corner, where the Reverend had kicked it earlier during his sermon.\n \nShe looked me straight in the eye and said:\n \n“Oh no! I've been \nhealed by our Lord, Jesus Christ!\n I will never sit in \nthat\n thing again!”\n \n..And off toddled the most ignorant American I've ever met.", "authorship": "human"}

Holding my arms up like this is exhausting.”\n \n…\n \nI hope you know none of that’s true.\n \nI do pump myself up before a big lift sometimes.\n \nIt can indeed be awkward.\n \nSlaps are given. Music is played. Grunts are, embarrassing as it is in retrospect, made.\n \nBut while I use it as a tool, I don’t rely on feelings of motivation, for reasons we’re about to get to.\n \nThe term motivation is used and abused too much and too vaguely. Before we can talk about it, we need to firmly define what it means.\n \nWhen discussing others, most agree that motivation is \nthe desire that drives their actions.\n \nSimple, right?\n \nBut when we’re talking about ourselves—and perhaps most specifically when we speak of notoriously hard to improve aspects of our lives—that’s \nnot\n the meaning we give it.\n \nWe then start mixing it up, with this mythical \nfeeling \nthat will be able to generate the energy required for us to behave in a particular way.\n \nWe tend to also treat it as a prerequisite; as if this feeling has to be present before we do a given thing.\n \n“I’m not motivated today.”\n \n“When am I going to be motivated again?”\n \n“I need some motivation before I start.”\n \nNotice however, that nowhere in the first definition does it say that one has to \nfeel\n motivation. It only speaks of the desire driving action. If I told you Usain Bolt was motivated to train for the Olympics, that only means he has a goal he values in his sights—not that every moment of his experience is filled with feelings of motivation. Point being, that \nthese two definitions of motivation are not the same thing.\n \nAnd that is a \nvery\n good thing.\nContrary to how we treat them, feelings aren’t instructions we should follow, sent from the deep, all-knowing core inside of us.\n \nThere is at least no evidence of that.\n \nThe unsexy, best guess of a truth we currently have is that\n feelings are our brains best interpretations of outward stimuli \nbased on our personal biology, history, personality, expectations and culture.\n[1]\n \n[2]\n \n[3]\n \n[4]\n \nAlso, as the high-school version of me would tell you: feelings are fickle beasts.\n \nNot constant, but fluctuating.\n \nNot rational, but irrational.\n \nNo one feels pulsating motivation \nall the time,\n just like no one feels constant anger, happiness or joy.\n \nDoing something you’re not used to doing, it’s in fact very likely you’ll not \nfeel\n much motivation—at least at first. Rarely do we like doing that we’re bad at.\n \nSo \n“motivation the feeling”\n shouldn’t matter.\n \nWhat should is the \noverarching desire\n that drives our actions, even—and perhaps especially—when we don’t particularly feel like performing those actions.\n \nWhat drives people to train everyday and what we need isn’t \nmotivation\n, but \ndedication\n.\n \nDedication, to a goal we’ve set ourselves.\n \nDedication, to being who we want to be.\n \nDedication, to what \nmotivates us\n.\n \nNo one wants to eat vegetables, drag themselves to the gym and go to bed early. These are not sexy, fun or appealing things to do. The only reason why some do them is because they’re dedicated to an overarching goal, desire or way of life they value.\n \nBut is doing whatever you want to do going to be a constant uphill battle? Are you never going to like it?\n \nThe good news is that’s highly unlikely.\n \nIf you’re anything like most people, you’ll enjoy it more and more the more time you spend doing it.\n \nAs stated, we like doing things we’re good at and we become good at that which we do. It’s a \npositive feedback loop.\nOne action spurs another, which again spurs the original action.\n \nFurthermore, we mostly don’t operate based on momentary desire. Virtually no one contemplates how they feel about brushing their teeth or weighs the pros and cons of cutting their nails.\n \nDoing so would be exhausting and extremely inefficient.\n \nMost of our decisions are made blindly, out of habit. That which we do everyday is treated just as things to be done. Exercise becomes very much the same way.\n \nIt’s also important to notice how motivation and dedication are not on opposite sides of the spectrum. One does not take away from the other. In fact, they’re symbiotic, feeding off of each other.\n \nThe stronger your motivation—being the \nthing\n, the \ngoal\n, the \ndesire\n that motivates you—the easier it is to dedicate yourself to it. The more you’re able to dedicate yourself to something, the more motivated you’ll feel, because you’re now accomplishing what motivates you, and few things are more motivating than sensing progress towards a goal we value.\n \nMost often, it works like this in practice:\nFind something that motivates you.\n As we’ve gone over, this doesn’t mean something you’ll enjoy doing 100% of the time, but simply something that’ll make you happy/successful in the long run.\nDedicate yourself to it.\n You’ll inevitably, for a moment or 100, not want to do it. Do it anyway.\nDo it for a long enough time that it becomes ingrained. \nYou’ll have to fight less and less to do it. Some days, you’ll still have to though. That’s life.\nToo many people accept blindly the idea that they need to feel motivated to do something. That which we decide as true shape our vision of the world.\n \nIf reaching your goal is something that’s important to you, I strongly recommend leaving that crowd and the idea that feelings of motivation are a prerequisite for action behind.\n \nDon’t depend on a fleeting feeling. Depend on what will make you happiest in the long run.\n \nMotivation will come and go.\n \nIt rises, like the ocean, then it sinks again.\n \nAnd you’ll be there. Still going strong. Still working.\n \nWith it.\n \nWithout it.\nTo answer your question directly: No one feels motivated to workout every day. People simply do so because of their habits, environment and identity. If you want to be more consistent in the gym, those are the things you should aim to change, not your feelings of motivation.\nFootnotes\n[1] \nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/feeling-our-emotions/\n[2] \nWhy Your Biology Runs on Feelings - Issue 56: Perspective - Nautilus\n[3] \nhttps://humdev.uchicago.edu/sites/humdev.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shweder/2008--The%20Cultural%20Psychology%20of%20the%20Emotions%20-%20Ancient%20and%20Renewed.PDF\n[4] \nhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.577.4057&rep=rep1&type=pdf", "authorship": "human"}

It is the deadliest natural disaster of the 21st century , [ 11 ] one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history , and the worst tsunami disaster in history. [ 12 ] It is also the worst natural disaster in the history of Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand. [ 13 ] It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Asia, the most powerful earthquake in the 21st century, and at least the third most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the world since modern seismography began in 1900. [ 14 ] [ a ] It had the longest fault rupture ever observed, between 1,200 km and 1,300 km (720 mi and 780 mi), and had the longest duration of faulting ever observed, at least ten minutes. [ 18 ] It caused the planet to vibrate as much as 10 mm (0.4 in), [ 19 ] and also remotely triggered earthquakes as far away as Alaska . [ 20 ] Its epicentre was between Simeulue and mainland Sumatra. [ 21 ] The plight of the affected people and countries prompted a worldwide humanitarian response , with donations totalling more than US$14 billion [ 22 ] (equivalent to US$23 billion in 2023 currency). Earthquake USGS Shakemap for the event The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was initially documented as having a moment magnitude of 8.8. The United States Geological Survey has its estimate of 9.1. [ 23 ] Hiroo Kanamori of the California Institute of Technology estimates that M w 9.2 is best representative of the earthquake's size. [ 24 ] More recent studies estimate the magnitude to be M w 9.3. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] A 2016 study estimated the magnitude to be M w 9.25, [ 29 ] while a 2021 study revised its 2007 estimate of M w 9.1 to a new magnitude of M w 9.2. [ 30 ] The hypocentre of the main earthquake was approximately 160 km (100 mi) off the western coast of northern Sumatra, in the Indian Ocean just north of Simeulue island at a depth of 30 km (19 mi) below mean sea level (initially reported as 10 km or 6.2 mi).

This forces the body to adapt. It doesn't adapt much to a stimulus that is easy for it to accomplish.\n \nBut...introduce some lighter weeks every 4-12 weeks, these tend to work themselves in quite naturally in my experience with busy folks as you go on vacation or get caught up in other things every now and then. However, the more experienced you get with training the more deliberately you should probably plan what we call de-loads.\n \nA few deloads within the year:\n \nAllows the body some recovery time to adapt to a repetitive stimulus given to it over a period of weeks or even months\nPrevents overdoing it \nGives you a bit of a mental break\nThat being said it's probably not really crucial for people just starting in with exercise as you won't be able to work at really high levels of intensity until you've been training for a little while (probably 3-6 months at a minimum).\n \nTraining should get progressively harder over time because your ability will get progressively better over time, but it should also be cyclical. You progress as much as you can over a period of time \n(usually about 4 weeks for most folks and to keep things relatively simple) \nthen back off a little and let nature do it's thing -- \ncompensate for all the training.\n \nWeight loss requires inefficient workouts, so you need to track your efficiency and improvement. If you're fast, then maybe distance based training is more inefficient. If you're good with distance than maybe speed based training is more inefficient. You want to cycle to more inefficient methods that your body isn't as comfortable with roughly every 4 or so weeks to keep your body adapting.\n \n30 minutes of walk/run is a good place to start but your body will quickly become adapted to that stimulus if it stays the same for too long. \n \nSo assuming you're only using this method, here are some ideas on what to track so you're progressively overloading your 30 minute walk/run:\n \nSpeed\nHeart Rate\nDistance\nRest\nSpeed\n \nIf you're running at 6mph and walking at 3mph then obviously bumping up your speeds means you're improving. Try to add 0.1 mph each time you go in to one or the other. This is assuming you're using something like a treadmill but you could do the same outside with a GPS tracker. \n \nThe faster you run the less length of time you'll be able to maintain that speed so faster intervals often require more rest and burn a little more. They are also generally more effective in my experience for fat loss, but periodic improvement, change and variety trumps high intensity interval training still.\n \nObviously the faster you go the more rest you need, but you might not want to start sprinting right away, work up to it over the first few months. \n \nHeart Rate\n \nRequires a heart rate monitor, I'd recommend a chest strap as they are the most accurate and will work with pretty much any kind of equipment at the gym. If you can work at a greater speed with a lower heart rate, then your cardiovascular fitness is improving, if you start to notice that improvement taper off over time (like after 4 weeks of training) then it's a good idea to switch what you're doing or switch what you're measuring.\n \nAnother thing you can watch for is what we call Heart Rate Recovery, or how quickly your heart rate comes back down after you run back to a walk. The faster this is, the more cardiovascularly fit you are and I'd argue this is more important in the grand scheme of things than heart rate alone. If the speed of your recovery tapers off, again you need a change and/or you should consider shortening your rest interval of your walk-run, or increasing the speed of one or the other.\n \nDistance\n \nIf you cover more distance with the same walk run protocol in the same time frame, obviously you improved speed. Covering more distance in the same time frame is an indication you are getting more fit, if this tapers off, again another indication that something needs to change. You could also simply make your objective to cover more distance and not worry about tracking speed. The difference of this metric is really just where your focus lies.\n \nRest\n \nLess walking while keeping your running at the same intensity is obviously harder. So you could choose to monitor this and rather than altering the above, just knock 5 seconds off your rest intervals each workout until you can't keep up to your previous work interval \n(an indication you've tapered off and need a change)\n. So you do 6 mph run for 2 minutes, 3 mph walk for 1 minute, then do 55 seconds, 50 seconds, 45 seconds, 40 seconds, 35 seconds, etc....keep the work interval the same if you use this method.\n \nPick one variable to monitor and change either every 4 weeks or when you notice that you're not improving that variable. Don't change a bunch of variables at once. For instance, if you are doing 2 minutes of running and 1 minute of walking, try to bump up your speed to as much as you can handle over a 4 week period, but don't also change the duration of the interval. Next 4 weeks, change the duration of the interval but try to keep the speed consistently as high as you can. Give yourself constraints for improvement and roll with one change at a time for simplicity sake. This also gives you a lot more opportunity for variety every 4 weeks, rather than changing too much at once.\n \nI'd say if 3 workouts in a row are far too similar in progress \n(i.e. you can't get a little bit faster, or take less rest, or run longer than you did 3-4 workouts before)\n then you need to change something, generally if you have enough variety in what you're tracking.\n \nThat's the general principle behind training.\n \nHowever, for fat loss, I'd highly recommend learning how to do some resistance training and add that into your routine every other day \n(conditioning work one day for 30 minutes, resistance training the next for 30 minutes) \nespecially full-body compound movements like squats, deadlifts, presses, pulls, etc...\n \nSee additionally, my answers to:\n \nWhat are the best ways to reduce and eliminate belly, abdominal, and thigh fat?\nHow do you customize a weight loss and exercise plan for yourself?\nWhat should everyone know about strength training and weightlifting?\nWhat is a realistic plan for losing 20% of my body weight?

I also try hard not to make assumptions about what people SHOULD know. Different people know different things because they live in different circumstances, have different needs and desires, and so they pay attention to different things.\n \nI was at an antique steam tractor show in Minnesota once. They also had a lot of regular tractors too. I’d bet you most of the people there would fail a geography test. But they could take a broken tractor apart, fix the problem, put it back together, and it would run just fine. That is something MOST people in this world could not do. So who, in this example, should be called ignorant? In my book the people who feed us can be forgiven for the state of their knowledge of geography as long as they keep those tractors running.\n \nOn the other hand there IS appalling ignorance around. Part of it is our failure to properly educate our children in any number of ways. I have a cousin who lives in a nearby town. Her children were not taught anything about World War Two “because it might upset them.” And we pass failing kids on to the next grade anyway so that we don’t damage their self-esteem, thus teaching them that they don’t have to learn. Or if a kid is disruptive a teacher cannot just haul him down to the principal’s office any more; the teacher has to call the intervention team while the kid rages on. In my daughter’s high school chemistry class they never once used actual chemicals; it was all “book learnin”.\n \nI live in Massachusetts in a town reputed to have a very good public school system. One day I went to a grocery store here in my town, grabbed a pair of 99 cent food items which were not taxable so I would pay $1.98 total. The checkout girl was a kid wearing a sweatshirt from the local high school. Anyway I had 98 cents in change so I pulled out a dollar bill and handed it and the 98 cents to her before she told me what I owed. She looked at me incredulously and said, “How did you do that?” What? “How did I do what,” I asked in response? “How did you know how much it would be,” she answered. I honestly don’t remember what I replied, if anything. I wonder how much self esteem she had.\n \nPeople are also ignorant because of TV, the movies, and now the Internet. They use up LOTS of time, time which might otherwise go to learning. And people believe what they see on TV, YouTube, etc, as if it were fact. DIS-education by the Media is very hard in particular on people’s knowledge of science and on critical thinking. I wonder how any of our children ever become engineers or scientists. I can’t even think where to begin on this one…. \n“OMG, radiation from Fukushima has been detected in California. Throw those strawberries in the trash at once!” Inoculations cause autism. Nuclear reactors run as long as the heater is turned on\n …. The good news with these people is that if you sit them down and explain things to them one on one then they will learn, ie ignorance in such people can be overcome with education. But ignorance takes a huge toll because it leads to bad political decisions which affect all of us and the future of our nation and the world. Global Warming, anyone?\n \nLet us not forget those other great forms of entertainment, drugs and alcohol. I am a recovering alcoholic myself. I am fortunate that I did not start drinking until I was out of college. However I hear lots and lots of people at AA meetings who did start drinking and drugging in school, even in elementary school. Their education mostly just stopped. And speaking of ignorance, we didn’t learn anything from the very failed experiment of Prohibition; the “War on Drugs” just goes on and on…..\n \nWe are also becoming a nation of believers. I am not JUST talking about bible thumpers. Believers go beyond merely ignorant. I am talking about people who \nbelieve\n that something is true and reject all evidence contrary to their belief. Bible thumpers, of course, reject the theory of evolution which they try to have not taught in our schools. But the political left also has its beliefs. For instance, a history book my daughter was given said that the Cultural Revolution in China, one of the greatest slaughters in human history, “caused a lot of suicides”. And how about the university researcher who studied human intelligence and published a paper stating that intelligence is mostly genetic. Other staff members at that institution tried to have him fired. Those kinds of belief-driven values perpetuate ignorance because such people simply refuse to let knowledge in, and they go out of their way to spread their demonstrably false beliefs to others. Or fire people they disagree with. Oh let us not forget the flat-earth and “Nibiru” people either. They are also among the proselytizers of ignorance.\n \nOne final mention since I am married to a teacher. The government keeps interfering with education. I won’t comment on the pros and cons of policies which come down upon teachers from on high, but whether good or bad two facts are inescapable: Complying with all those requirements takes more and more of our teacher’s time, and therefore teachers have less and less time to teach, and what is studied becomes narrower and narrower, clearly a cause of massive ignorance.\n \nSorry for the rant, but there are reasons for the ignorance in this country. We are pretty ignorant about how we raise our children, and ignorance begets ignorance.\nADDENDUM: I want to add Trump supporters to my list of the most ignorant Americans. The more ardent the supporters the more [intentionally] ignorant they have to be to overlook Trump’s criminal behavior, especially the lethally ignorant choices Trump made regarding his COVID-19 “policy”. As of today, 5/20/2021, we are approaching 600,000 Americans dead thanks to Trump. His supporters’ refusals to be vaccinated or to even believe that COVID-19 is real (\n*\n) can only push up the number of dead by becoming infected themselves and by spreading the virus to others too.\n \n*\n I actually heard a Trump supporter say that there was no such thing as COVID-19 when I stopped at a convenience store while I traveled west across the US by car just before the 2020 election. The few people standing around him were nodding their heads. On my way back east just after the 2020 election I saw and heard people rejoicing in the streets.

Otherwise you’d be playing the same guys on the same level and that shit would get old real quick because there was no challenge.\n \nThat’s kinda how your workout is. If you’re doing the same reps with the same weight, eventually your body is going to get bored because there is no challenge. It already built up the muscle and strength needed to lift that weight.\n \nThere’s no reason for your body to progress because it can handle the stress you are giving it through your workout.\n \nJust like the video games you enjoyed, you need to hit the next level to see results.\n \nLEVERS OF PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD\nWhen it comes to progressive overload there are a few levers you can adjust to increase the challenge.\n \nWeight\n: Arguably the most used and abuse lever. The concept is simple, add more weight to the bar.\n \nReps\n: Increase the number of reps you can lift a certain weight for.\n \nSets\n: Increase the number of sets per exercise.\n \nTime Under Tension\n: Increase the time your muscles need to support the weight.\n \nRest Periods\n: Decreasing the time between sets.\n \nTraining Frequency\n: Adding another day of hitting a muscle group without being debilitatingly sore.\n \nEach week work one of these levers to add progressive overload to your muscles.\n \nBut this is when it starts getting hairy because a haphazard approach could lead to gainz in the short term. Unfortunately, muscle isn’t built in the short term, it’s a long term project so you’ll need a plan.\n \nTHE PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD METHOD\nThere’s a few different methods for ensuring progressive overload in your workouts. The most basic one is called a Single Progression method.\n \nSingle (or Linear) Progression Method:\n Basically each workout you increase the weight on a lift.\n \nLet’s say you can bench 225 for 8 reps.\n \nWeek 1: 225 for 8 reps\n \nWeek 2: 230 for 8 reps\n \nWeek 3: 235 for 8 reps\n \nEtc.\n \nOn paper this is pretty sweet. But for anyone that has ever lifted a weight ever, you know damn well shit doesn’t go that smoothly.\n \nEventually, you’ll hit a point where you can’t get 8 reps with good form. You’ll get 5 solid reps and 3 cockeyed-am-I-gonna-die reps.\n \nSide Note: IMO this is a piss-poor way to progress. It’s very short sighted.\n \nDouble Progression Method:\n In this method you increase reps first then weight.\n \nSay you can bench 225 lbs for 8 reps.\n \nWeek 1: 225 for 8 reps\n \nWeek 2: 225 for 9 reps\n \nWeek 3: 225 for 10 reps\n \nWeek 4: 235 for 8 reps\n \nWeek 5: 235 for 9 reps\n \nEtc.\n \nI like this method much better than the Single Progression because it allows you to get stronger and “milk” the results from a certain weight.\n \nFor this, I like to work in rep brackets rather than just a target number of reps per set. Instead of saying 3 sets of 10 reps, I would give my clients something like 3 sets of 8-10 reps or change the desired reps in each workout within that bracket.\nThis way you have a range to progress and you know where the ceiling is to increase the weight. Once you hit the top of the range on all your sets, drop the reps to the bottom of the bracket and increase the weight.\n \nThis is the best for busy individuals with time restriction to their workouts. It takes an extra min to add another rep to each set.\n \nTriple Progression Method: \nIn this method you first increase the reps, then sets and finally weight.\n \nBringing back our benching example:\n \nWeek 1: 225 for 3 sets of 8 reps\n \nWeek 2: 225 for 3 sets of 9 reps\n \nWeek 3: 225 for 3 sets of 10 reps\n \nWeek 4: 225 for 4 sets of 8 reps\n \nWeek 5: 225 for 4 sets of 9 reps\n \nWeek 6: 225 for 4 sets of 10 reps\n \nWeek 7: 235 for 3 sets of 8 reps\n \nEtc.\n \nFor this method I would still keep the rep bracket and only increase 1 set before increasing the weight. Depending on how many exercises you do this on, you can easily add another 10-15 mins to your workout.\n \nHOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU USE PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD\n \nThe first week of a new workout is the feeling out process.\n \nFinding the right weight for each exercise, how the exercise sequence flows with the flow of everyone else in the gym (i.e. are you waiting on equipment) and learning the right form for new exercises.\n \nLet’s assume we are using a double progression method here.\n \nSo for week 1, I always tell my clients do the workout as-is and pick a weight where you get close to failure at the lower end of a rep bracket.\n \nIn week 2 you’ll know what to expect and we can start pushing a little more. Try increasing reps on all sets.\n \nWeek 3 through whenever: Once you can hit the top of the rep bracket on all the sets. Increase the weight and drop the reps back down.\n \nNow if you change your workout every 4 weeks you probably won’t be able to see the increase in weight right away. Odds are you’ll still be trying to increase the reps by the end of the fourth week.\n \nWhich is fine. It’s still progressive overload and you’re still getting closer to your goal.\n \nIf you like your workout, stick to it. There’s no harm in going 6-7-8 weeks with one workout program. If anything you’ll get really good at those particular lifts and not to \nmention stronger\n.\n \nAfter about 12 weeks or so, I would say you need to switch the exercises up a little just because you’ll be building weaknesses in the areas that aren’t the focus of your particular workout. Plus, if you’re doing something like heavy squatting for 12 consecutive weeks your hips and knees will need a break.\n \nWILL YOU PROGRESS EVERY WEEK?\n \nAbsolutely not.\n \nSome workouts are just going to suck.\n \nOthers are going to be a cake walk.\n \nThe fact of the matter is that you have a lot of shit going on in your life which can drain some gym energy. The important thing is to try to do more each week.\n \nSometimes you’ll get there. And the more and more you advance into your weight lifting career the harder it is to make progress.\n \nIf you’re a gym noob, I would expect week over week improvement for the first 6 months or so.\n \nIf you’re a little more advanced I would expect every couple of weeks you’ll see in increase.\n \nIf you’re\n advanced\n, first off I have zero idea why you’d be reading this, but anyways…If you’re advanced once every couple of months seeing an increase.\n \nAnd that is progressive overload. Now go build some muscles.\n \nAesthetic Physiques", "authorship": "human"}

It was down mainly to poor management along with a very young staff lacking direction and frankly near bankrupt.\n \nFive of us went in as consultants to get the company “cleaned up”, and to help out we engaged an American (claiming to be a) part qualified accountant. It turned out that he did not have the qualifications that he claimed, nor the European equivalent.\n \nOne of the Consultants was a very young but mature Nigerian chap, who did have qualifications gained in Nigeria and South Africa, but at that time in England not recognised. He was a “real” accountant, i.e. someone who knew what the answers should roughly be, not what a computer told him they should be and know when the latter was wrong. Not run by a computer, but the computer was a tool, but equally knew when that tool was defective !\n \nHe was a mountain of a man, about 6′ 3″ and probably the best part of 16 stone…. but muscle and bone; no waste (so to speak); equally one of the most gentle, well mannered person’s you could wish to meet.\n \nHe was doing some pretty serious work on the General Ledger, and some of that was going to directly affect the accounts for that month as well as other implications. The nature of this meant that he had to use some pretty complex Spreadsheet applications and formulae.\n \nThe two main consultants had Degrees in Law and Accountancy respectively and I had a specialisation in insolvency and debt collection to litigation standard. We had another junior member of staff of about 19 years old who was there to help us, mainly through the knowledge she had of the way the company worked before it got in to difficulties. She was good at what she did and extremely helpful but we needed an “in-between”.\n \nThat person was selected by one of the consultants without reference to the others, and it was more to do with nepotism than knowledge between the two. The American lad had a chip on his shoulder made of silicone and thought he was the greatest thing since sliced bread. Actually he was an ignorant, racist, nasty piece of work, (Incidentally I am native, white, English) and regrettably came over as the stereotypical arrogant American.\n \nHe held the assumption, that (in his view) everyone owed America everything. Indeed given that he was probably no more than 25 himself, he actually believed he knew more than everyone else as far as accountancy was concerned and that he was “pack leader”. Unfortunately one of the main consultants actually believed this and treated the boy as his mouth-piece.\n \nWe would frequently have informal staff meetings to keep each other up to date with what was going on, and where additional help (where this American lad, and the Ghanian Accounts Assistant fitted in) was to be deployed.\n \nThe Nigerian man, in his early thirties and was doing some pretty complex work on a spreadsheet, along with an interface with the in-house accounting system. Something that he could not really steer his attention from at the drop of a hat.\n \nThe “leader of the pack” (so to speak) decided to call one of these update meetings. The American lad had been talking to him, and stuck his head out of the office door and said: “ OK you guys’ - need to getta [sic] yourselves here now for a meeting !\n \nNnamdii, the Nigerian guy, who was working on this complex spreadsheet just raised his head and said that he would be along shortly. In reality, he did not need to be part of this particular update as it was Credit Control issues that were the main focus of the meeting.\n \nThis American brat, turned on Nnamdii and said: “ now listen coon: I told you to get here now so betta [sic] get your arse her or I’ll pound you Nigger: remember America owns you ! “ Pointing aggressively at Nnamdii\n \nThe four of us were stunned by the arrogance, near violent behaviour of this American lad, (who frankly could barely add up), not withstanding the incredibly racist statement and the aggressive way it had been delivered.\n \nHowever, there was one thing that this little chap hadn’t bargained on. I don’t think that he had ever seen Nnamdii stand up (in the physical sense) to his full height!\n \nVery calmly, and without shouting, Nnamdii “saved off” the spread sheet, and slowly looking up and over his glasses (he wore rounded spectacles which merely made the matter more intense) very quietly and calmly stood up; almost appearing to expand out of the chair like an inflatable.\n \nHe just pointed to the boy and said “don’t you ever make such a rude or racist statement like that to me!” ; you arrogant, ignorant little man.\n \nBy this time we were all thinking “ that guy is going to be dead- should we call an ambulance or under-taker first?”\n \nThe American lad, just dug himself in to an even deeper pit by turning to the rest of us and saying: “..you can’t let that shit talk to me like that…” .\n \nWe didn’t.\n \nThe Managing Director, having over head the commotion (from a floor away ! ), had walked in to the room, walked up to the boy and in one hand picked up the bag that the brought in to work, and gave it to him; in the other hand pointed to the door, and the only two words used were: “LEAVE. NOW !”\n \nAmazingly this American lad was still protesting that everyone was being unfair to him and should give him another chance (not realising I think that had Nnamdii not lost his temper he he would be dead) he was lucky to be alive in any case.\n \nThe MD just told the boy that he had called the Police and that he was to be escorted off site. For his own safety the boy was escorted out of the room by two other blokes who were in the room at the time and down to reception.\n \nHe was later charged with racial abuse, breaches of the Race Discrimination Act (civil action), Intent to cause an affray and breach of the peace (Criminal), abusive behaviour with intent to endanger life [on the basis had Nnamdii let loose he could have been killed] and that the affray could have caused damage and harm to other people (both Criminal).\n \nImmediately after the Hearing and Conviction, he was expelled to New York via the American Embassy in London. It later came back to us through the Agency that he had had his Passport withdrawn.\n \nAs they say in English Law: “take your victim as you find them”.", "authorship": "human"}

The exact words said might be slightly off since it’s been about 8 or 9 years now.\n \nIn college, I took a class on the history of prostitution. It was an intense debate-style class. Graduate level (I was an undergraduate.)\n \nAt the end of the quarter, our professor invited us to her place for a class picnic. Since her area of research was communism in Vietnam, she marked the picnic spot with a communist flag tied to a large shrub in the front of her housing complex. It was pretty easy to drive past her place as it was right next to a freeway exit and kind of tucked away. Something large and striking was definitely necessary, and all of her students would have realized that it was hers immediately. In fact, I remember a few of us chuckling over it upon arriving. Make a mental note of that. The flag was being used to mark our picnic spot and was on the housing complex’s property that was facing the street.\n \nThe picnic went pretty smoothly. We had fun. We ate, we talked, we relaxed. Most of the people had left, but about 7 or 8 of us remained.\n \nSuddenly we heard some violent cracking, and turned around to see someone pulling the flag off the shrub. I asked my professor if she wanted me to fetch it and a few of us ran down to retrieve it from the middle-aged lady who was angrily pulling branches off the flag.\n \nWe politely asked her for the flag back, mentioning that it was our professor’s.\n \nHer response was, “YOU CAN’T FLY THIS FLAG IN AMERICA.”\n \nOur eyes widened. This is, of course, untrue and we knew it. We asked for the flag back again, calmly and politely. By this time our professor and a few others came down to try and get the flag back.\n \n“YOU CAN’T FLY THIS FLAG IN AMERICA! IF YOU’RE GOING TO FLY THIS FLAG IN AMERICA, YOU’VE GOTTA FLY THE AMERICAN FLAG ABOVE IT!”\n \nHoo boy. Our professor calmly told the lady why the flag was there and asked for it back. I should mention that the capslock is entirely warranted. She was yelling at us the entire time.\n \n“MY DADDY DIDN’T FIGHT IN IWO JIMA SO YOU COULD FLY THIS FLAG IN AMERICA.”\n \nI’m sorry…what? We were all history buffs, if not history majors, so we all knew that the battle of Iwo Jima had very little to do communism.\n \n“MY GRANDFATHER BUILT THIS HOUSE.” (She pointed to the house behind her, which was next to the housing complex my professor lived in. What any of this had to do with her grandfather or the house, we had no idea.) “YOU CAN’T FLY THE RUSSIAN COMMUNIST FLAG IN AMERICA.”\n \nMy professor switched tacks. “That’s actually not the Soviet Communist flag. It’s-”\n \n“YOU CAN’T FLY A CHINESE COMMUNIST FLAG IN AMERICA. MY DADDY AND HIS BROTHERS DIDN’T FIGHT IN IWO JIMA SO YOU COULD FLY THIS FLAG HERE.”\n \n“It’s not the Chinese Communist flag.”\n \n“THEN WHAT IS IT?”\n \n“It’s the International Communist Party flag. Could I please have my property back, ma’am?”\n \n“NO! I’M GOING TO RIP YOUR FLAG UP AND PUT IT IN THE TRASH!”\n \nWith this she storms off, leaving her slightly horrified husband/partner/relative/whoever he was standing there holding a bag of groceries. He apologized. My professor told him again that we were just using it to mark our picnic spot and she really just wanted it back. He promised to get it back to her.\n \nWe students were just kind of dazed. I think a few of us exchanged shocked glances and statements of disbelief like “What does Iwo Jima have to do with this??? World War II wasn’t really about fighting communism???” (Well, kind of…)\n \nThen, suddenly, the lady re-emerged carrying a very large American flag on a pole, started waving it around and declared to us:\n \n“THIS IS THE ONLY FLAG THAT SHOULD BE FLYING IN AMERICA. IF YOU’RE GOING TO FLY A COMMUNIST FLAG, YOU BETTER FLY THIS FLAG ABOVE IT!”\n \nOh lordy.\n \nIf I recall correctly, at this point she went back to ranting more about World War II, how much she hated communists, and her relatives who fought in whatever wars. But we were done. The professor said a few words to the man about getting her flag back and we retreated back to our picnic where we tried to process whatever the hell that was.\n \nThat woman gets my vote for the most ignorant person I’ve ever met in America.\n \nI didn’t really expect her to know the difference between the International Communist Party flag or the Russian Communist flag, but like many folks of her type she didn’t seem to understand the basic definition of free speech. We had every right to fly that flag, whether we were actually communists or just using to mark our picnic. Nor is there is a stipulation that we fly an American flag above it.\n \nOh, and the American fighting in the Pacific Theater in World War II didn’t have a whole lot to do with communism. Her father was fighting the Japanese Imperialists, and the Japanese Imperialists were just as anti-communist as we were/are.\n \nEdit/Note for future commenters: A lot of folks have already mentioned flying the Nazi flag as a comparison to what my professor did by flying a communist flag. You don’t really need to mention it again. Besides, I disagree that a communist flag provokes the same sort of offense and feeling that a Nazi flag does. Perhaps this is heavy bias on my part considering my personal family history. And now you know why I kind of wish you’d stop bringing up the Nazi flag all the time.\n \nA lot of folks have also made the argument that I would get equally mad upon seeing an offensive flag flying in my neighborhood. Well, actually I do have an offensive flag flying in my neighborhood (a Confederate flag) and I do nothing about it. I’d love to get the owner to take it down, but there’s very few ways to do that without starting a fight or making him want to keep displaying it. It’s awful, and I think it’s a terrible thing for the kids in our neighborhood to have to view everyday, especially the kids of color who live really close by.", "authorship": "human"}

Looking to ensure you move forward properly to ensure optimal results?\n \nWhen it comes to forming a workout, there are many ways you can go about getting the job done. There is not one ‘perfect’ strength training or cardio workout program for everyone, but rather, one that’s right for you.\n \nThis said, there are some important ground rules that everyone should remember when forming their workout program. If you are not abiding by these rules, you could be in for problems down the road.\n \nLet’s look at the seven important commandments of an effective workout program.\n \nCommandment #1: Thou Shall Prioritize Compound Lifts\n \nBicep curls, leg extensions, lunges, squats, push-ups… there are so many exercises, how can you choose?\n \nFirst, prioritize the compound exercise. A compound exercise is one that utilizes more than one muscle group at once, thus you are getting a higher overall level of calorie burning as well as strength progression.\n \nThis includes moves like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, bent over rows, shoulder presses, lunges, and pull-ups. Do these first and foremost in your program. Once they are scheduled in, then you can begin focusing on the other more isolated exercises.\n \nIn some cases, you may not even need those isolation exercises depending on what your goal is and what type of workout program set-up you’re using.\n \nCommandment #2: Thou Shall Obey The 48 Hour Rest Rule\n \nNext, make sure that you are always obeying the 48 hour rest rule. What does this mean? It means that you must be taking at least 48 hours between workouts for the same muscle group.\n \nThis is the total amount of time it’s going to take for your muscles to recover appropriately between sessions. So if you hit chest on Monday, don’t do any chest focused exercises until Wednesday at the earliest.\n \nBut remember, because you hit shoulders while hitting chest (as they are called into play as well), this means shoulders should not be done until Wednesday as well.\n \nThis can take a good amount of planning on your part, but if done properly, will make a big difference in the level of recovery and results that you see.\n \nCommandment #3: Thou Shall Incorporate Sufficient Variety\n \nAnother important rule of effective workout programming is that you are incorporating enough variety into the workout routine. This not only helps keep you mentally fresh and invested in the program, but it also helps keep your body responding as well.\n \nIf you are going to the gym and doing the exact same workout day after day, guess what? It’s only going to be so long before your body gets bored. And, when your body gets bored, you stop seeing results.\n \nIf you are stuck in a progress plateau, try changing things around. Usually this is enough to get your results moving again. It doesn’t need to be big changes you are making either. Something as simple as using a different rep range or changing the exercises you’re performing around should be sufficient.\n \nCommandment #4: Thou Shall Not Skip Warm-Ups\n \nShort on time in the gym? Figure you’ll bypass the warm-up to save time? You might want to think again.\n \nWarm-ups are a must. Yes, they will take an additional five to ten minutes out of your workout routine, but they help ensure that you are going to see optimal results as your muscles will be firing stronger, thus you’ll be able to lift more weight.\n \nOh, and they help you avoid injury as well. If you are injured, you won’t be doing any exercise, so clearly this is critical. Take the time and do the warm-up. You’ll be thankful you did.\n \nCommandment #5: Thou Shall Always Use Proper Form\n \nUsing proper form is also a necessity when it comes to seeing great results. Too many people let their ego get in the way. They add weight sooner than they should be and even though the form is sacrificed, keep going.\n \nThis usually leads them to either not seeing results at all, or worse, ending up injured.\n \nThe minute you move out of good form, stop the exercise. Lighten the load and start again. Using good form will ensure you are hitting the muscles are you are supposed to for that movement, guaranteeing you see superior results.\n \nCommandment #6: Thou Shall Apply Overload\n \nNext, it’s also a must that you apply proper overload. If you go into the gym and don’t challenge your muscles, you can’t expect to see results. It’s that simple.\n \nOverload can come in the form of more reps performed or more weight lifted. It doesn’t really matter as long as you get it done one way or another.\n \nRemember, you need a change in your workout in order to get your body to change. If you aren’t changing anything, there’s no motivation to get stronger or more fit.\n \nCommandment #7: Thou Shall Have Fun\n \nFinally, the last commandment is one that is too often neglected - fun. That’s right, your workouts should be fun as well. If you aren’t having fun in the gym, the chances that you keep going back for more are going to be a lot less and you might just find that you forgo exercise all together.\n \nWith so many different ways to structure your workout, there’s no reason to not have fun. If your current plan isn’t enjoyable, try a few new types of exercises instead.\n \nRemember that you don’t even have to be doing exercises in the gym to get in a great workout either. You can take your workouts outdoors, to the local park, or to a sporting field if that’s what you prefer as well. Exercise comes in many shapes and forms and while not all variations will yield the same results, having fun needs to be a priority.\n \nSo keep these points into consideration as you plan out your workout program. By doing so, you’ll help ensure you see maximum success.", "authorship": "human"}

The question always start out the same.  “I want to get stronger…” and then the caveats kick in.  “…but I don’t want to get more muscular…” or “…I don’t want to put on weight…”  These questions ask for the impossible.  If you want to get stronger, the only way is to increase your muscle size and density.  Period.  Granted, you could lose fat and build muscle and still weigh the same, but I assure you, when this happens, you WILL look more muscular, and that’s not a bad thing.\n \nIt appears that you’re looking to increase your functional strength as opposed to your gym strength.  To build functional strength, compound movements are the best way to go.  Compound movements are Olympic type lifts that require you to transition from one large muscle group to another large muscle group.  For instance, in the power-clean, you go from a deadlift start and end up standing with the weight pressed above your head.  Obviously you will not be able to clean as much weight as you would if you were doing a normal deadlift since you will have to press the weight over your head.\n \nThe difficulty I have in suggesting a customized training plan for anyone that I don’t get to work with in the gym is that everyone is different in their strengths and weaknesses and while one lifter may have more endurance, another may have more explosive power.  These two lifters will respond differently to a set workout and it’s up to a good coach to recognize when to push one aspect (explosive power) or the other (higher reps).\n \nGenerally, to build muscle strength and density, you should use a pyramid scheme that focuses on at least five sets, excluding your first and maybe your second set which is merely a warmup.  After your warmup with extremely light weights, your next three lifts will incrementally build up to your last two sets, which is where the work and growth really begins.  Your last two sets should be at a weight where you are on the verge of struggling, while keeping good form.  On the bench, your last two sets should require your spotter to keep a careful eye on your lifting, ready to assist if necessary.\n \nIf you’re lifting heavy weights, then the number of sets you should do will increase because you’re need more sets to safely work up to your max weight, and your muscles will need more work to get to the top weight.  For instance, approximately 8 weeks through a 13 week lifting cycle is when I want to start hitting certain milestones to ensure I will be at the top of my game come competition time.  Here’s a typical example of my bench workout.\nWarmup with just the bar;\nWarmup with just the bar;\n10 reps at 135;\n6 reps at 185;\n6 reps at 225;\n6 reps at 275;\n6 reps at 315;\n6 reps at 345 - This is my working set\n6 reps at 375 - This is the second of my working set.\nAlthough this “routine” seems pretty standard, the importance of having a good coach cannot be understated.  What my coach would do is watch how easy I did a set, then calculate what the next weight would be.  For instance, if on #7 I slowed down on rep 5 & 6, meaning my explosive power was waning, he would either make me rest a bit more to allow me to recover more, but not too much, or on set #8, he may move the weight only to 330.  The object is to be able to hit your working weight and complete it almost to exhaustion.  If I was having a particularly bad day, I may take out a set and adjust the weight accordingly.  What was most important is hitting your working sets and completing them.  This is important for several reasons, but the primary reason you want to complete your working sets is psychological.  When it comes down to it, it doesn’t matter what weight you lifted on set#6, or even if you have a set #6, what matters is you hit your goal for that week.  You’re setting yourself up for success the following week by being successful this week.\n \nIt is so important to hit your goals that even on weeks where I found myself stronger than expected, i.e. I blew through my first working set without any issue and it feels like I can add another 50# for my second working set with no problem, instead of increasing my goal for that week, I was told to focus on more explosion or better form and technique instead of adding additional pounds to that week’s goal.  What the coach may then do is recalculate \nnext\n week’s goal a bit higher.\n \nI guess the take away from this long winded answer is to set a lifting cycle for at least three months.  Start the first week by doing approximately six sets for eights, the second week, drop off a rep and do six sets for seven, increasing each successive set’s weight more than the week before.  You should be able to handle this as you’re taking away a rep.  Next week, drop a rep and increase the weight….\n \nIt’s important to set a goal and take the necessary incremental steps to reach that goal.  Some people go to they gym with the attitude of “I want to get stronger”, which is good, but difficult to achieve because it is so ambiguous.  However, if you say “Today I can do a max one rep bench at 225 and in 12 weeks I want to be able to max at 275” that is a goal that can be tracked accurately and you can adjust your weights, sets, reps, diet, sleeping accordingly.  At the end of the 12 weeks, hit your goal then take a week away from the gym, maybe a bit more, then come back and say “Today I can do a max one rep bench at 275 and in 12 weeks I want to be able to max at 315.”  Then, you chalk up your hands and get to work.", "authorship": "human"}

Others do really well on high volume!\n \nIn general, I tend to recommend more volume for those that want to improve size, as the research shows that gains tend to scale quite linearly with volume. However, it might not be that clear, for a few reasons.\n \nHigh volume training\n tends to increase \nsarcoplasm \nin the muscle. This is like your fuel tank-it includes glycogen storage as well as mitochondria for energy production needed during high volume training.\nSo, if you train with high volumes, your body can adapt by making your fuel tank bigger. Makes sense, right? This looks like muscle…because it basically \nIS \nmuscle. It’s \nin \nthe muscle and it looks like muscle from the outside. It’s muscle…just a different type.\n \nBut…it won’t really make you \nstronger\n. In fact, pound for pound, it’ll actually make you \nWEAKER\n, as it doesn’t help your strength, but does add weight!\n \nIt’s not contractile tissue!\nMuscle is mostly water…and then protein…but there is glycogen and fat there, too. That’s sarcoplasm. Fuel tank.\n \nSo, a lot of these studies are switching people from low (or no) volume programs to high volume programs, and finding that their muscles get bigger. A big part of what they are often seeing is the fuel tank getting bigger in response…\nnot \nthe actual muscle fibers!\n \nI’d wager that after a few weeks of going back to lower volume training (or nothing)…a lot of those gains are going to be lost, because they body doesn’t really need as big of a fuel tank anymore. It’s temporary. It’s transient. If I do high volume and then go on vacation, in a week or two, that extra weight is GONE. It’s often up to 4–5kg, and it’s not preventable with eating more. It’s a response to training.\n \nIt’s a longer-duration pump.\nArnold\n \nloved \nthe pump…he often trained forty, fifty, sixty sets per workout before competitions. And he responded marvelously to it.\n \nHe bench pressed north of 500lbs when he was a young man, but during his Mr. Olympia prep, most sets seemed to be with 2–3 plates per side-just 225–315lbs, about 50–60% of 1 rep max!\n \nFor set, after set, after set.\nSerge Nubret\n did as well-he did mostly sets of 15–20 reps far away from failure his entire career. Sometimes his workouts lasted \nFIVE HOURS\n, and he did them 6 times per week.\n \nPlus, he was French, so it was literally a full time job!\n \nWill this work for you?\n \nMaybe. But probably not.\n \nWithout anabolics, this type of training isn’t nearly as effective for size.\n \nMost strong advocates for \nhigh volume training \nare on drugs.\n \nDoing endless sets will just leave you tired, battered and injured.\n \nHowever…the thing is, most strong advocates for \nlow volume training\n are also on drugs.\n \nThe Dorian and Menzer method of one all out set to failure works for naturals…but best with pharmaceutical enhancement.\nThey are ALWAYS growing, so they can get away with this type of training.\n \nFor naturals, both high volume and low volume are death sentences for gains.\n \nWhy?\n \nHigh volume\n will cause an increase in cortisol, which is very catabolic and can cause muscle breakdown. It can also cause a decrease in testosterone, and if you are natural you don’t have the luxury of ignoring that. High volume will pump you up, but after a few weeks you’ll plateau hard. Your sarcoplasm can only get so big.\n \nLow volume\n isn’t enough stimulation for a natural to grow optimally in \nmost \ncases. Especially if you cannot push a set close to or to TRUE failure, then low volume training will be crap for gains. Guess what? Most people cannot-or at least, do not.\n \nI think in five years, I’ve seen maybe five people go to true failure in the gym…let alone go beyond failure. Part of that is because I’m in China where the gym culture is new…but I think globally, people training HARD is just quite rare. I typically train quite \nclose\n \nto\n \nfailure\n.\nIt’s just how I’m wired.\n \nFor a natural, ideally you need a mix. Moderate volume most of the time, occasional high volume blocks, occasional low volume blocks with the odd week or two totally off.\n \nSometimes to failure, sometimes a few reps shy, sometimes completely avoiding it, especially if your goal is strength as well as size.\n \nYou need to be SMART about how much volume you do. A lot of this is individual, and you’ll have to discover for yourself.\n \nFollow me on \nInstagram \nfor daily diet and training tips!

I’m a poor guy as far as my financial situation is concerned not with my attitude or dreams.\n \nI come from a very poor family background with Big Dreams. We used to live in a small village with a monthly income of Rs. 6,000. My mother who is a tailor who is the only source of our family, she sacrificed her life for the benefit of our family development but things are not going as she used to think. I don’t want to talk about my father, though physically he is there, he is not contributing to our family in any way rather he used to torture my mother every time. He is completely addicted to alcohol. I had a younger brother who is completely deaf and dumb, this has become one more challenging task for our family. As we are not financially capable, no one used to support us, including our relatives. I can’t explain my pain within crispy words. Nowadays, the so-called Vitamin M (money) is the only criteria for anything, you may accept it or you may not accept it.\n \nAiming :\n \nSo, I aimed big to wage a war against my poverty, I decided to become a Civil Servant, so that I’ll get recognition and fame. At that time, I thought, education was the only solution for me.\n \nMy Journey :\n \nI had no money to go and stay in Hyderabad. So, I’ve written Osmania University Entrance examination for my post graduation on the advice of my English Lecturer, actually my plan is to get shelter and then prepare for my IAS examination. By God’s grace everything went very well. I got good rank and I joined there for my post graduation. (For my preparation only)\n \nAshok Nagar, Hyderabad :\n \nI’ve no idea about the civil services examination, so I decided to go for coaching. I’ve had my search for the best coaching institution in Hyderabad, where thousands and lakhs of people are roaming around the Ashok Nagar cross roads in the name of IAS coaching. Actually, it is more than a business and business of business. I’m not in a position to cope up with big institutions where the crowd is so high. Then, I decided to choose the institution with minimum strength.\n \nCivil Services Mission:\n \nI don’t want to mention the institution name but I found it. Things were going on my way. But here comes challenge again, I need to pay Rs.60,000 for my coaching. I had no idea how to pay.\n \nThanks for the Internet. I used to search on the Google for helping hands to support me, actually I’ve sent more than 2500 emails to different NGOs and trusts all over the India, including few persons individually whom I found on Google.\n \nI got few positive responses. Fortunately, I got support from them to continue my preparation. I paid the fee and I started working on my mission.\n \nStruggles and Sorrows:\n \nI had only three pairs of dresses. If I want to go for coaching I’ve to wear the one dress for two to three days.\n \nI did all the Hard Work what I can do. My only ambition is to get into the civil services. No other exams.\n \nI’ve written IAS examination 4 times in a row but failed to clear it. Twice, I had my mains. But no result. As I’m zero at maths, I was not in a position to take any other bank or SSC examination.\n \nDay and night struggles, I’ve had my tears. Things were changed at my home, mother and brother got hospitalized. My father is not caring anything about our family. I came back I’ve taken care of my family.\n \nFailure and Impact :\n \nEverybody is used to point me, they used to show me as a symbol of failure. I may failed in my IAS examination but I’m not going to fail in my life. I’m a fighter, though I failed in civil services, I learned a lot from the journey. How can a single sheet of examination paper can decide my future? Everybody is Unique, right?\n \nNo contacts. No relationships. No money.\n \nApproaching the Politicians :\n \nAs I’ve had immense knowledge as far as administration and policy making is concern, I approached few politicians to work as an assistant to them. But got rejected everywhere.\n \nEntrepreneurial Journey :\n \nFormal education will make you a living but Self-education will make you a Fortune. As the start-up revolution is going in India, I had a question in my mind – why don’t I start my career as an entrepreneur?\n \nI’ve had my ideas, I worked on it but again the lack of funding has become the major concern for me. Whatever the start-up idea I’ve in my mind, it has become a $100 million dollars company in USA. Of course, you may believe or you may not.\n \nNow???\n \nNow, I’m no longer in a position to write any examination or no longer want to work under someone. I want to become a self-made entrepreneur in any way. I’m not going to give up on my dreams.\n \n“if the plan is not working, change the plan but not the Goals”.\n \n“Body has it’s limitations but mind has no limits”\n \nThis information age is giving enormous amount of opportunity to each and every individual. I wanted to catch it and cash out.\n \nYour Help is Needed :\n \nI would love to welcome your suggestions or advices or help or criticism in any way.\n \nI may not be the perfect guy to answer you but I can feel and express my opinion by stepping into your shoes in a perfect way.\n \nI’m not giving up rather I’m challenging myself to get what I want. I’ll persist until I succeed. For me, the true happiness always lies in Fighting.\n \nThanks For Being Awesome,\n \nSURESH MADHA !!!", "authorship": "human"}

Trump, as bad as he is, is only a distant 2nd to Palin in incoherent commentary.\nShe’s a great example of where our nation is heading in the immediate future. However, I fear her Stupidity, Dogmatism, and & Anti-Intellectualism will pass as “intelligent musings” under a Trump Presidency. “Oh, youbetcha’” Maybe a White House position, \n“Secretary of Bad Speeches?”\nI’ll let her insipid words demonstrate my point:\n \n“We believe that the best of America is in these small towns that we get to visit, and in these wonderful little pockets of what I call the real America, being here with all of you hardworking, very patriotic, um, very, um, pro-America areas of this great nation.”\n \n“You mentioned education, and I'm glad that you did. I know education you are passionate about with your wife being a teacher for 30 years, and God bless her. Her reward is in heaven, right?” \nDoh? Heaven? How about a livable paycheck?\n \nWhen Katie Couric asked Palin the “complex trick question” of where she gets her news, the two women had the following exchange:\n \nCouric: “And when it comes to establishing your world view, I was curious, what newspapers and magazines did you regularly read before you were tapped for this -- to stay informed and to understand the world?”\n \nPalin: “I've read most of them again with a great appreciation for the press, for the media…”\n \nCouric: “But what ones specifically? I'm curious.”\n \nPalin: “Um, all of them, any of them that have been in front of me over all these years.” \nWhere, in the dentist’s office?\n \nCouric: “Can you name any of them?\n \nPalin: \n“I have a vast variety of sources where we get our news.”\n \nOne sure sign of an imbecile is referring oneself in the plural, “we.”\n \nIn 2010, while speaking at a fundraiser at California State University. Sarah Palin made the mistake of claiming that Eureka College, which is in Illinois, was in California.\n \"This is Reagan country. Yeah! And perhaps it was destiny that the man who went to California's Eureka College would become so woven within and inter-linked to the Golden State.\" \nDoh?\n \nIn 2010, Sarah Palin referred to Kodiak Island as the largest island in the United States. \n\"As we work and sightsee on America's largest island, we'll get to view more majestic bears, so now is a good time to draw attention to the political equivalent of the species.” \nSorry Sarah, but that would be Hawaii, and what is the “political equivalent of species?”\n \n“Hey, the more they’re pouring it on, the more I’m going to bug the crap out of them by being out there, with a voice, with the message, Hopefully running for office in the future too … Bless their hearts, those haters out there. They don’t understand that it invigorates me. It wants me to get out there and defend the innocent…”\n \nWhile at a motorcycle rally in 2011. Sarah Palin dropped this unforgettable quote,\n “\nI love that smell of the emissions!” \nHow about the taste? A little viscous and salty, I hear.\n \n“Maybe our kids could be defended against criminals on the spot if more Mama Grizzlies carried [guns]. And [the] Obama administration wants you ID’d for that? Well, then go ahead and carry a sign too. A sign that says ‘Yeah, I carry a gun because a cop is too heavy.’” Then, \nsaying that creating gun-free zone schools and other public buildings is “stupid on steroids.”\n Yes, she’s truly an expert on stupid.\n \nIn 2011, while, on the O’Reilly Factor, Sarah Palin was asked how she’d fix the Oil spill in the Gulf. Her insightful response was, \n“The Dutch and the Norwegians, they are known for dikes and for cleaning up water and for dealing with spills.”\n \nIn 2010, while, on the Glenn Beck Show, Palin was asked how she would deal with rising tensions between North and South Korea. Her response, \n\"\nBut obviously, we've got to stand with our North Korean allies.\"\n \nAnd my personal favorite: In 2011, when asked about Paul Revere’s midnight ride, Palin had this to say. \n\"He who warned, uh, the British that they weren't gonna be takin' away our arms, uh, by ringing those bells, and um, makin' sure as he's riding his horse through town to send those warning shots and bells that we were going to be sure and we were going to be free, and we were going to be armed.\"\n \nMs. Palin is a stunning example of the \n“Dunning-Kruger Effect”\n in action, which basically maintains that \nthere are people so stupid that they don’t even realize they are stupid\n, and see themselves as clever.\n \n“The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which low-ability individuals suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their ability as much higher than it really is. Dunning and Kruger attributed this bias to a metacognitive incapacity, on the part of those with low ability, to recognize their ineptitude and evaluate their competence accurately.” \nDunning–Kruger effect - Wikipedia\n \nSee also: \nThe Psychological Quirk That Explains Why You Love Donald Trump\n \nNuff said? “You Betcha!”", "authorship": "human"}

Today, there are just as many frustrated lifters as there were 20 years ago, when gym rats spent 20 hours per week or more in their local box.\n \nMost\n bodybuilders hit plateaus, no matter how often they lift, because they don't want to change their routine—comfort quickly leads to fewer gains.\n \nUsing an old pre-season football strategy of two-a-day workouts—literally lifting twice in one day—is a great way to mix up your routine, giving you better muscle and strength gains while helping to slash body fat.\n \nAnd no, you don't have to be in the NFL to do two-a-days!\n \nThis approach is great for anybody looking to make awesome gains on a tight schedule because, as it turns out, two 30-minute workouts are actually more productive than one 60-minute workout.\n \nAdvantages Of Two-A-Days\n \nOne of the greatest benefits of doing two-a-days lies in the obvious—you're working out twice in one day and, hopefully, you're also eating two post - workout meals!\n \nBy working out twice, you get your protein synthesis and other anabolic systems racing. If you take full advantage of this by having two post-workout meals, you can start to see your gains skyrocket.\n \nYou will also find yourself able to train with more intensity.\n \nWhen faced with a full hour's worth of exercise, most of us subconsciously conserve our energy early on, so we don't find ourselves dragging through the latter portion of the workout. By splitting the total day's training between two sessions, intensity levels start and finish higher, which is key to new strength and muscle gains!\n \nAnd since you're fully ramped up for each workout, you'll burn more total calories than if the whole workout had been done at the same time.\n \nThe greater calorie deficit will offset the extra food being eaten, and the overall affect is more muscle with more fat burn\n \nHow To Do Two-A-Day Workouts\n \nTwo-A-Day Basics\n \nSome basic rules apply to all two-a-day programs.\n \nWhile you don't have to be exact with the timing, you need to allow at least six hours between the two workouts. If your workouts are much closer than this, you'll be too tired for optimal performance during round two.\n \nBecause of this, most people find it easiest to hit the gym in the morning before work and then catch another session after work. Going on your lunch break and then again in the evening also works well, as long as you've waited at least six hours.\n \nYou also have to make sure you limit your workouts to no more than 40 minutes in length, excluding the warm-up.\n \nAnd yes, it is very important for you to perform a proper warm-up and cool-down to speed up recovery, since you'll be back in the gym before the day is over!\n \nThe light, rhythmic exercise you get with a proper cool-down, such as 5-10 minutes of an easy aerobic activity like running, will help the heart to return the pooled blood trapped in the pumped-up muscles, speed up the removal of lactic acid and other metabolic byproducts, and allow the muscles to lengthen again after the chronic contractions of a good lifting session.\n \nYou'll quickly get tired of two-a-days if you're constantly fatigued, so a quick and efficient recovery is the key to this program's success.\n \nTwo-A-Days Should Be Cycled\n \nSimply doing two random workouts in one day will quickly lead to overtraining and burnout. There's a proper way to structure your program so that you meet the increased energy demands and take full advantage of this unique fat-burning and muscle-building opportunity.\n \nDue to the intensity of training, these programs are best saved for busting through plateaus, or for those times when you're extremely motivated to work out and the idea of going to the gym that much sounds appealing.\n \nTo avoid overtraining, two-a-days should be cycled—two weeks on, one week off—or you'll burn out and, alas, plateau—the very thing you'd hoped to overcome.\n \nTreat the two-a-day regime with respect, and it will respect you back!\n \nDesigning A Two-A-Day Program\n \nWhile there are plenty of ways to design your program, one of the most effective is lifting heavy in the first workout, then lighter in the second.\n \nThis lets you train your high-threshold muscle fibers—the ones with the most strength and growth potential—with a short, tough workout in the morning, while fitting in an evening workout that's easier but longer.", "authorship": "human"}

By splitting the total day's training between two sessions, intensity levels start and finish higher, which is key to new strength and muscle gains!\n \nAnd since you're fully ramped up for each workout, you'll burn more total calories than if the whole workout had been done at the same time.\n \nThe greater calorie deficit will offset the extra food being eaten, and the overall affect is more muscle with more fat burn\n \nHow To Do Two-A-Day Workouts\n \nTwo-A-Day Basics\n \nSome basic rules apply to all two-a-day programs.\n \nWhile you don't have to be exact with the timing, you need to allow at least six hours between the two workouts. If your workouts are much closer than this, you'll be too tired for optimal performance during round two.\n \nBecause of this, most people find it easiest to hit the gym in the morning before work and then catch another session after work. Going on your lunch break and then again in the evening also works well, as long as you've waited at least six hours.\n \nYou also have to make sure you limit your workouts to no more than 40 minutes in length, excluding the warm-up.\n \nAnd yes, it is very important for you to perform a proper warm-up and cool-down to speed up recovery, since you'll be back in the gym before the day is over!\n \nThe light, rhythmic exercise you get with a proper cool-down, such as 5-10 minutes of an easy aerobic activity like running, will help the heart to return the pooled blood trapped in the pumped-up muscles, speed up the removal of lactic acid and other metabolic byproducts, and allow the muscles to lengthen again after the chronic contractions of a good lifting session.\n \nYou'll quickly get tired of two-a-days if you're constantly fatigued, so a quick and efficient recovery is the key to this program's success.\n \nTwo-A-Days Should Be Cycled\n \nSimply doing two random workouts in one day will quickly lead to overtraining and burnout. There's a proper way to structure your program so that you meet the increased energy demands and take full advantage of this unique fat-burning and muscle-building opportunity.\n \nDue to the intensity of training, these programs are best saved for busting through plateaus, or for those times when you're extremely motivated to work out and the idea of going to the gym that much sounds appealing.\n \nTo avoid overtraining, two-a-days should be cycled—two weeks on, one week off—or you'll burn out and, alas, plateau—the very thing you'd hoped to overcome.\n \nTreat the two-a-day regime with respect, and it will respect you back!\n \nDesigning A Two-A-Day Program\n \nWhile there are plenty of ways to design your program, one of the most effective is lifting heavy in the first workout, then lighter in the second.\n \nThis lets you train your high-threshold muscle fibers—the ones with the most strength and growth potential—with a short, tough workout in the morning, while fitting in an evening workout that's easier but longer.", "authorship": "human"}

Not someone who knows better and doesn’t care…not someone who should be informed and isn’t…someone who is literally *ignorant* (not knowing) about the broader world.\n \nFreshman college composition class, required for literally all students. Doesn’t matter if you major in chem or philosophy or women’s studies, you have to take this class. While it ostensibly focuses on basic college-level reading and writing (lots of writing to prompts, reading short passages and analyzing them, etc.), the TAs who taught it also took it as an opportunity to get everyone in the college environment engaged in critical thought about the world at large. The class met 4x per week, and every other Thursday we had a seminar discussion on an assigned reading…just a time to discuss and argue ideas presented, sometimes about controversial topics.\n \nOne seminar focused on an article that argued that countries with “biblically-based” (meaning the christian bible, largely the new testament, but with a lot of talk about the “10 commandments”…I KNOW…take what you like from the old!) laws suffered less crime than those with laws based on other philosophies. It was a fine and, actually, well-written article, but it was clearly assigned with the intention to rile up debate. Most of the students in the seminar said they disagreed with the article, citing the weakness of the conclusions (the author did stretch on what was considered “biblically-based law”) and ignoring certain societies that are less violent than, say, the US, but have certain laws that would go against the modern, christian bible (say, free access to abortion or civil partnerships for gay couples (this was long enough ago that only the Netherlands had, at that point, provided full marriage equality)). One student was sitting quietly and looking like he was about to burst at his seams as the discussion carried on, until the TA noticed, and asked him to share his thoughts.\n \n“I don’t know why we’re even arguing this. Everyone believes in the bible. Maybe they think that it doesn’t prohibit gay marriage or abortion, but they all believe in it. We’re just arguing what the 10 commandments mean, not whether everyone believes them. Why are we arguing whether biblical laws are correct? Everyone agrees they are, we just differ on what they mean!”\n \nTA: “Are you talking about the christian bible? The new testament?”\n \nStudent: “Yeah, all that stuff. Old and new. I know a lot of the old testament rules don’t apply anymore, but the basic stuff everyone believes in. The 10 commandments, love thy neighbor, jesus dying on the cross…everyone believes all that, so why are we fighting over it?”\n \nTA: “Would you be surprised to learn that most of the world’s people don’t believe in or follow the christian bible? Do you know anyone who’s jewish?”\n \nStudent: “I don’t think I do, but I know about jews…they believe basically the same things, but they don’t have christmas. It’s kind of like methodists versus baptists, right?”\n \nTurns out this student had grown up in a small town and had never met anyone who wasn’t a fairly traditional christian. He *literally* believed that everyone in the world was a christian of some sort. A jewish classmate explained to him the similarities and differences between christianity and judaism, an agnostic student explained to him how he had grown up with no religion at all, but had a vague notion of a “higher power.” Our TA found a muslim to come talk to the class about islam. And, a few weeks later, I found the moxie to stand up and tell the class about how I had chosen atheism (I was raised catholic). At the end of that class, a man who had never met anyone who didn’t share his faith traditions had heard from people who practiced several other faiths as well as none, and gotten to know us on a personal level in the process.\n \nHe was “ignorant” about the religions (and lack of) around the world, but, to his credit, was willing to listen and learn. When he first claimed that “everyone believes in the bible,” I found his ignorance stunning. But his grace in being willing to learn more was inspiring.\n \nAnd, yes, I do think this is a lesson for many people in these troubling times in the U.S. and elsewhere. We were stunned at his comments, at first, but heard him out, asked him to elaborate, and offered him the chance to learn. We didn’t shout him down and tell him he was wrong, full stop. He *was* wrong, but the path to getting him to understand that wasn’t ridicule and exclusion, but rather including him and educating him. And, of course, MEETING people in the groups he didn’t understand. Studies show that those who, say, are anti-gay-marriage tend to soften if not reverse their views once they meet and befriend someone who is gay. I can’t imagine this progression of views is that different when people meet and get to know someone who is muslim, an immigrant, etc.", "authorship": "human"}

Here’s the actual answer below.\nWell, all those things which I have, were actually bought by my father during the period when he was earning decently \naround 25k per month\n in a good marketing company with his genuine efforts during years \n2010–2015\n (except house). He was working there since 2003, but earned less than that earlier.\n \nLater, there were issues with the company and my father switched to another company and there was a\n sudden and extreme downfall in the income source\n. Note that though he is intelligent and hard-working, he is \nnot even a 12th-pass student.\n Yet he is \nthe only earning member\n in our house!\n \nOur present home was owned by my grandfather and father \nback in 90s\n when they came to Mumbai first. It’s rate was somewhere around \n50k\n those days.\n \nThe first 5 electronic gadgets we own (as listed above) were all bought during those 5 years (2010–2015)\n as there was \na technical aspirant growing up in the house\n and hence it became a necessity. We had a marginal budget though to buy those gadgets with our good savings back then. \nHence, the better of the cheapest gadgets!\n \nSome of you might ask how I afforded to study Engineering in a private college like \nVidyalankar Institute of Technology\n. It’s simple! \nWhen your father recognizes your dedication and hard work, he makes sure he earns and save that much! \nHe’s called father for a reason!\n \nAnyway I got \n40% of fees (about ₹45k) waived off\n, thanks to my caste. \n(That gratitude was only for assisting my hard work and situation, not otherwise!)\n.\n \nI still use the \nsame phone\n as it shows no signs of getting old even after \n7 years\n and I deal only with my phone calls and messages through it. I still use the \nsame laptop\n even though \nits battery and hinges are damaged\n as I get to connect to the Internet through it. Don’t get surprised!

So, as to not repeat what has already been said, let me add another option into the mix.\n \nFirst, I have a question for you: ”\nHow do you end your workouts?\n”\n \nDo you write down your final reps and sets into your workout log, maybe drink a protein shake, or possibly even get a quick stretch? Those are all good options, but let me suggest another one that will ensure you leave your workout in full body fashion—enter: full body workout finishers.\n \n—\n \nWha\nContinue Reading\nWhat are some good full body workouts?\n \nGood question, and an important one as well.\n \nThere’s a lot of good advice that has already been dropped on this post. So, as to not repeat what has already been said, let me add another option into the mix.\n \nFirst, I have a question for you: ”\nHow do you end your workouts?\n”\n \nDo you write down your final reps and sets into your workout log, maybe drink a protein shake, or possibly even get a quick stretch? Those are all good options, but let me suggest another one that will ensure you leave your workout in full body fashion—enter: full body workout finishers.\n \n—\n \nWhat the heck is a workout finisher?\nA workout finisher is a \nmini workout\n that you slide right at the end of your main workout. Finishers are great because they provide with you a highly effective full body workout in just a few minutes.\n \nBasically, finishers are designed to hurt.\n \nI mean not physically hurt you like getting spartan kicked in the chest would, but they should sting a little (or, a lot). Words and phrases that jump to mind when we’re talking finishers include:\nlactic acid buildup\nburning and searing\nthe darkest of pain caves\nbattery acid pumping through your veins\nI’m sure there are more but you get the idea.\n \nSo, how long should these epic pain-fests last?\n \nWell, there is no perfect answer here, but because the intensity of effort should be quite high I suggest keeping a finisher to around 8 (ish) minutes or less.\n \n—\n \nWhy finishers are awesome…\n \nBelow is the abridged list of why finisher are awesome:\naccelerate fat loss\nextremely time efficient\nincrease work capacity/conditioning\nincrease mental toughness and ability to endure “the suck”\n—\n \nWhat types of exercises make the best workout finishers?\nAgain, there is no perfect answer here, but my rule of thumb is to\n go lower on the skill side, and higher on the intensity side.\n \nThe reason I say this is that performing a bunch of highly technical/highly skilled movements as a finisher may actually decrease the intensity of effort.\n \nLet me explain.\n \nHighly technical and highly skilled movements require a great deal of finesse. If you’re super tired halfway through a finisher and you literally can’t do another rep of that high skilled movement (such as a muscle up), well my friend, you’re basically left just staring at the piece of equipment, letting your heart rate drop, and honestly not doing a finisher anymore.\n \nThis is the opposite of what you want.\n \nRemember, the goal with a finisher is to finish the workout with intensity. This means you’ll have to put a bit of thought into the exercises you select here. Personally, I’ve found the best exercises for finishers are the ones that allow you to keep grinding out reps, no matter how tired you get.\n \nExamples of these type of grind style exercises include:\nCardio machines\nBattle rope exercises\nVarious types of crawling\nAny sort of loaded carry\nKettlebell or dumbbell swings\nBasic bodyweight movements (pushups, squats, burpees,…etc)\nThis list is by no means exhaustive, but it definitely gives us a good place to start.\n \nWhen selecting exercises for a finisher the \nbig take-a-way is to shift more to grind style exercises vs. highly technical/high skilled exercises.\n Again, the point of doing this is to keep you moving, vs. just staring at the bottom of set of rings because you can’t nail your 5th muscle up in the finisher.\n \n—\n \nPutting it all together: 5 badass full body finishers\nFinisher #1→\n \nComplete as many rounds as possible in 6 minutes of:\n10 kettlebell swings\n50 foot goblet carry\n50 foot bear crawl\nFinisher #2→\n \nThree rounds of:\n12 dumbbell front squat\n12 dumbbell walking lunge steps (6 per leg)\n10 jump squats\n10 jump lunges (5 per leg)\nFinisher #3→\n \n30 hand release pushups\n16 burpees\n16 sandbag getups\n20 \nhand release pushups\n8 burpees\n8 sandbag getups\n10 hand release pushup\n4 burpees\n4 sandbag getups\nFinisher #4→\n \nThree rounds of:\n30 second dumbbell farmers carry (heavy)\n30 second bear crawl\n30 second air squats\n30 second dumbbell rack hold\n30 second hollow body hold\nFinisher #5→\n \n60 second stair climber (fast)\n20 kettlebell swings\n2 burpees\n45 second stair climber (fast)\n15 kettlebell swings\n2 burpees\n30 second stair climber (fast)\n10 kettlebell swings\n2 burpees\n \nThese five finishers all pack a potent punch, but for different reasons. However, two commonalities they share is their time effectiveness, and high suck factor rating.\n \n—\n \nFinal thoughts\n \nAs it seems, the answers you seek have already been laid out before you. I just wanted to throw finishers into the mix so you have a plan for “ending the workout with some intensity.” The five finishers I listed above will ensure that you finish any workout in full body fashion.\n \nGive them a try. Who knows, you might even love to hate full body workout finishers.\n \nHope this post is helpful.\n \nThanks for reading.\n-Tom C", "authorship": "human"}

Why?\n \nFor the following reasons:\n \n1.\n \nHe's been saying since last year that he's asked for a copy of his diagnosis and that he's going to get it soonish in basically every century long argument he gets into. And apparently, it's this spring that that he’s going to “segway” to YouTube. He has purposely been lying/saying these things for half a year. Only a naïve fool buys hi BS and has no critical thinking ability. He hasn't gotten his diagnosis. Because I doubt takes a year for a professional to get back to you (unlikely), or something complicated is stopping the process. But he would have just mentioned that by now, right? Kyle is just lying and purposely procrastinating over something he doesn't even have. No one should treat him as half as seriously as they do to every other poor sucker who tries to boost their credibility by lying out of their asses about being “diagnosed”. People who actually know themselves, don't need to wear it as a badge of honor to seek validation which subconsciously comforts their false beliefs.\n \n2.\n \nHe reinforced countless of times that ASPD+BPD males score 30+ on the PCL-R, so that he could receive validation for looking psychopathic. He's done this about 5-10 times on past accounts and wants people to think that he did. Really, if he actually did, it would have of been administrated and he wouldn’t need to so desperately reinforce this. After all, he is a repeat offender who is violent, right? Liar. Hey, anyone find it strange that someone who is so \"polite\" and who admits to having empathy for cats, could smash someone's head in with a crowbar? (As he claims).\n \n3.\n \nHe cares about animal cruelty (yet literally said dogs are scared of him because he's apparently \"evil\"). He obviously loves cats plus stands up for animal cruelty. This seems like a little too much empathy for a malignant narcissist he so calls claims to be. Why does he care so much if someone trolls him with dead cats? Even if he were a malignant narcissist, one would never react the way that trolls want them to and wouldn’t be affected by the trolling.\n \n4.\n \nHe literally had a pic from Wikipedia for the topic of narcissism, as his profile picture. He's just trying to appear more believable and is edgy. He also wrote this cringe ass answer regarding the history of when it was formed, it's like this image is his whole personality. Can you name one narcissist who cares about it being their image so deeply? Exactly. Edgelords have to try hard like he does.\n \n5.\n \nHe thinks that being low functioning and showing all of his true colours on Quora proves that he's credible. When in reality, he doesn't have proof of a diagnosis and therefore could be/is lying like everyone else who claims to be diagnosed. He doesn't have a diagnosis and the chance of being self-diagnosed is 50/50 like others he \"outs.\" Which means likely he is projecting about others \"self-diagnosing\" and he's probably envious they got more attention and recognition than him.\n \n6.\n \nDoes he have a cluster B disorder? Sure. Malignant narcissism? Three comorbidities of cluster B disorder plus Paranoid Personality Disorder and Sadistic personality disorder? Come on, think. Do you really think someone could have three cluster A disorders? No. Because there's too much overlap to make n accurate diagnosis. It's extremely unlikely anyone could actually have three cluster b disorders. There are too many similarities and overlap to be able to distinguish someone having three. It’s only possible to have two with overlapping traits.\n \n7.\n \nHe lies out of his ass. He obviously tries to buff himself up and look smarter than what he is by gaslighting his viewers into feeling they are dumb, by using big words he puts into wrong contexts/doesn’t know what they actually mean. His writing is sloppy and of a pseudo-intellectual. Honestly, he said he was going to get a PhD in history (obvious BS). Says he’s gonna get a diagnosis. Says he’s a malignant narcissist when he loves cats and has empathy for animals (too much for my liking). Says he was \"evil\" when he likes domesticated animals. Says he has paranoia when he was easily manipulated/lied to by a stranger on YouTube. Also, he says he was “banned” to look “cool” or “antisocial” when he has deleted his past accounts many times due to inadequacy and depression. You will find none of his old followers following any band accounts and the likelihood of them all unfollowing his past “banned” accounts is unlikely.\n \nHe’s a lying edgelord who projects that others are edgelords. Do us a favour, stop embarrassing yourself and delete your account.\n \nOh and Kyle, you’re not handsome.

Intervertebral discs are the gel like “spacers” that are found between each of the bones of your spine (aka, vertebrae).\nWhen these discs fill with water, they actually push the bones of the spine (verterbrae) away from each other. This is why you stand slightly taller in the morning, than at night.\n \nSo, first thing in the morning when you get up, these discs are full of water. When you stand up the water starts to run out the discs, and thus you become just a wee-bit shorter.\nOk, but why should I care about water in my discs?\nThe increased water in the discs actually makes the spine stiffer. However, this isn’t a good kind of stiffness.\n \nThis stiffness places a lot of stress on the discs and ligaments vs. the actual soft tissue structures designed to support and protect said discs.\n \nIt takes about an hour of standing for the discs to mostly empty of the water they obtained during sleep.\nSo…can I still workout in the early morning?\nOf course.\n \nBut, if you’re planning to workout within an hour (ish) of getting up you need to be careful about jumping into the following exercises too quickly:\nHeavy back squats or deadlifts → heavily compresses the spine\nHeavy kettlebell swings → ballistic hip hinging\nSitups → flexing your spine through full range of motion\nExcessive bending and twisting movements in general\nBelow are a few good options to get your spine warmed up, before crushing an early morning workout:\nWake up earlier → gives your spine more time to get back to equilibrium before hitting the gym\nGo for a brisk walk or light jog, before hitting the weights → moving around helps reduce spine stiffness a little faster\nExtend your warmup → if you normally warmup for 5–8 minutes, extend that out to 12–15 minutes.\nBut you didn’t answer the question…Is a morning gym workout \nbetter\n for the health of your spine than an evening gym workout?\nDone correctly, both early morning workouts and evening workouts are fine for your spinal health.\n \nIf you’re working out in the morning, you’ll just need to pay more attention to your preparation before you start crushing heavy weights at the gym.\n \nTrust me, it’s worth paying a little more attention and not just jumping into 1RM deadlifts or squats in the morning, in order to keep your spine injury and pain-free.\n \nAgain, the reason why I’m saying this is that suffering a debilitating back injury really sidelines you, and will make your life absolutely miserable.\n \nTrust me, this happened to me about 12 years ago—back when I was foolishly squatting heavy at 6:30am before classes (and before knowing this information).\nFinal thoughts\nLike I mentioned earlier, this answer can be taken in many different directions. \n“Better”\n can mean a lot of different things; so I opted to go with what I think is the most important topic to talk about—the health of your spine.\n \nI don’t want this answer to scare you out of working out in the morning, though.\n \nThat’s not my intent.\n \nMy intent is to simply highlight things you need to be aware of, if you are in fact going to workout in the morning.\n \nI hope this answer helps give you a little better idea about keeping your spine healthy during early morning workouts.\nSources for this knowledge\nMost of the knowledge I have learned about spinal mechanics has come from the various work of Dr. Stuart McGill.\n \nDr. McGill is the world’s leading expert in spinal biomechanics. He’s definitely an individual you should listen to regarding spinal health. If you Google his name you’ll find dozens of articles that he’s published about the spine.

And I got cured of some igmorance and innocence as well.\n \nThis was in the spring of 1991 or so, just around the big recession. I was 22, out of the army, unemployed, applied and accepted onto a college course starting in the autumn and was looking forward at a summer of boredom. I’d managed to change my savings to USD with a really favorable rate so I decided to do a road trip before college started as I knew it was a last chance. Now I’d attended a catholic school staffed by nuns from Missouri, so I had a pretty good command of English even it was my 3rd language. So I flew into New York, and after a week or so I decided to take a coach down to Miami with a Greyhound pass.\n \nYeah, young and stupid me, but after the army I wasn’t really that picky on comforts and didn’t want to blow my finances. Somewhere around the Mason-Dixon line the bus which I thought was an express coach changed into more local services, and we’d change a bus every now and then and go east and west and slowly southwards. In the middle of the night we stop and this young white bloke, not much older than I was, got escorted into the bus by two sheriffs and as they politely asked was the seat free seated next to me. Being now wide awake I was a bit puzzled about my new travel companion, and he was about as puzzled about me so we ended up talking through the night, smuggling in a few beers in at the truck stops and smoking in the back under a coat as you did.\n \nNow I was an European and brought up by the nuns as ’colorblind’ so I had never realised how divided the US society actually was along color lines. Where I was from you didn’t have much ethnicities and NYC was such a shock I just rewired my brain and didn’t actually realise *I* was now the minority people would stare at. Also NYC has public transport, so taking a coach… well, again I had not realised USA was a country where having a car is about as a requirement as going out with your pants on. I mean I had read about it but *realising* it was a different thing. I came with just a duffle bag and a few things as clothing was cheap in the US and I was going to update my wardrobe. So I’d bought a spiffy ”cafe racer” leather jacket in NYC… and you can guess where this leads to. A 6”3 lily-white jarhead in a coach looking like… a bad undercover cop? ( I had quite a few people ask me that.) Oh, ex-military, fine ( didn’t elaborate which military)… And some bemused people asking the other ”why are you speaking with *that* ” and ogling me with disdain. At some point and time I realised I was the only white person on the bus… until the midnight stop.\n \nSo, the only two white guys on the bus, heading down to Florida. My new mate had been paroled from prison and put on the bus to get home to the town north of Jacksonville where his family ran a sawmill. His accent was a southern drawl I had some challenges with, but he had more trouble with my accent. \nEven after I dug out my passport he couldn’t fathom I was a ”foreigner” as ”I was white and spoke English”.\n (Thinking of this I can now understand what Americans mean by ”white privilege”, though I don’t think this was anything privileged.) Funny thing then for me was he was this strong as an ox farmer boy and scared shitless of all the other non-white people on the bus (he did use terms that the nuns would have stuffed a bar of soap in my mouth for). I do not know was it my naivety or arrogance or both that I had no such fear, but he basically thought of me as his bodyguard and I was thinking nobody dares give us grief if I go around with this giant. And here we get into that ”southern hospitality” - we were finally changing buses in Jacksonville and I got a genuine offer, not only come visit but basically a job at the sawmill as he’d learned I was unemployed and was just drifting. Being on a tourist visa or some such details weren’t a problem, after all I wasn’t a ”foreigner”…. when he started mentioning his sisters were single my future started sounding a bit too ”Deliverance” so I handed my now silly drunk best buddy over to his dad who fortunately had shown up to collect the prodigal son before the local law took interest in him, and gave my best excuses I couldn’t join them.\n \nI made it down the coast until Ft. Lauderdale where I thought enough is enough and jumped out and found a motel and a well-needed shower. And my learning curve continued but thats a different story. I’ve thought a few times if I hadn’t had that college placement and been a bit more drunk would I now be playing a banjo somewhere on the Georgia border.", "authorship": "human"}

With big changes come adjustment periods. In this guide to creating your perfect home workout routine we’ll cover:\n \nWays to start working out from home\n \nHow to use your home as a gym\n \nFree resources for creating a workout from home routine\n \nBudget-friendly tips for creating a home gym\n \n2. Set a Schedule\n \nFirst, create your weekly schedule. This is so important for carving out time for fitness. Aim to schedule at least 40 minutes a day for your workout from home routine. You can cut it up into 15-minute intervals. Take one day off a week or alternate your workout between an at-home stretching routine and a daily at-home fitness routine.\n \nOne tip to sticking with your at-home workout routine is to prepare for it just like you would if you’re headed to a gym. Put your workout clothes shoes and water bottle all right next to your home office space. Consider even wearing your workout clothes while you work. That way you’ll have fewer excuses to carve out the time for an at-home workout.\n3. The Best Free Resources for Working Out from Home\n \nRight now there are countless free workout routines available for you to stream from anywhere. Check with your regular gym, or use my free YouTube videos. If you are hypermobile, check out our Spoonie Resources page too for links to many Hypermobility specialists.\n \n4. Create Your Own Workout\n \nTake some time to engage your mind and get creative with your workout from home routine. Create your own workout routine with these easy steps:\n \nPick 9 exercises in a row that use equipment you have in your home. If you don’t have any equipment, pick bodyweight exercises.\n \nPick an exercise for your upper body core and lower body. Three of each works nicely\n \nDo 8 to 12 reps of each and move on to the next one with just a 10-second break. Work your way through the list 3 to 5 times.\n \nRepeat 3 times a week.\n \n5. Go for a Daily Walk or Jog\n \nGetting outside is extremely important while you’re limited to leaving your house. Find time to go for a daily walk or jog. If you’re walking, bring 1 to 2-pound hand weights with you avoid using ankle weights, which cause unnecessary strain on your knees and hips. Do speed intervals by speed walking or lightly jogging for one minute then at a normal pace for 2 to 3 minutes.\n \nIf you’re a jogger do the same thing, except don’t choke the weights. Hold them as loosely as possible in your hand.\n6. Get Creative\n \nKeep your workouts fresh by switching up your routine. Change your walking route mix and match exercises and use an app once a week. Find a unique blend of different exercises that works for you. Don’t be afraid to experiment a little bit here. Try working out during different times of the day or opt to try a new way of exercising. Take advantage of the freedom you have to set your schedule from home and make the most out of a less-than-ideal situation.\n \n7. Go for HSD/EDS Safe Exercise Apps\n \nRight now there are a lot of fitness apps that are offering at-home workout routines for free. But most of these are not safe for hypermobile persons. These apps are specifically designed to have safer exercises for persons with unstable bodies. A few of my favorites are:\n \nThe Zebra Club - by Jeanie Di Bon\n \nPhysioEd\n8. Split Everything into Small Breaks\n \nIf you're juggling kids at home a spouse who’s got a lot of conference calls and a million tasks piling up with your work and life we hear you. Seriously. This is A LOT to take on at the moment and exercising at home might be the last thing on your mind especially when you’re low on spoons. There are certainly ways to carve out time for a workout from home routine.\n \nInstead of trying to get a 30-minute block in, split it up into smaller intervals. Do a work task and then take 3 minutes for a single exercise. If you use this method, use a low-load with little to no extra weight. Without being warmed up it’s unsafe to add weights to your exercise.\n \n9. Take Your At-Home Workout Outdoors\n \nOne way to make your workout from home routine successful is to move your workout outdoors. If you have an outdoor space set up your laptop or phone outdoors for a workout full of Vitamin D. This is a great way to not only work out from home but boost your immunity too. Sunshine boosts your mood and the fresh air is good for your soul. Not to mention that Vitamin D3 is vital for a healthy immune system.", "authorship": "human"}

1at the age of seven years ,i received nursery education in a different area from the one i joined my primary school. this had to happen after my parents separated after a very long domestic violence{which mother narrates to me since that time i was a toddler} when we moved to a different county our life was full of struggles for mum had to work as a casual laborer in potato farms and earn not more than 3$ we are a family of 7 boys and six girls though at the time we moved to the later county all the sisters were married and my two brothers and non was well up to support us younger siblings. before i forget my dad had married a second wife and had 8 siblings besides us,4 boys and 4 girls,the second wife was younger than my mum and i think its because of her that dad discriminated us, but unfortunately a year before we vacated she died.i want to clearly state that since the age i came to realize my self i can only recall two different instances when i saw my dad at home { since age 3 to age 6} i too wanna add that i never at one point saw him smiling. and most of the times he came home{ according to mum} he could just quarrel out of nothing solid, he could go to an extent of beating mum. this makes me shed tears when i remember this,ooooh no i love my mum!!\n \nconsequently mum had to look food for five boys [my mum is not educated, she only went up to class 2} and thus cant find such a good job. after she had hustled quite good money {9$} she took the five of us a government primary school and paid the whole amount of 9$ as enrollment fee.school fees had to be paid later with installments. that was the time i joined class one. we were a poor family to an extent that we didn't have good clothes, food but not shelter since we were living in my grandmothers homestead who had died a couple of years ago.\n \ngod is good, when i did my final primary exam i passed well.i received an admission letter from a national school but i couldn't join since there wasn't enough funds to pay my fees {at this age i was bit mature and i could understand what was going on in our family. without any argument mum proposed a local school which was not far from home but i chose a different one which was also a local school but was a bit far from home {8km} which i could walk to and fro everyday. since i couldn't afford bus fair and the school had no bus.the reason why i chose the school was that it was the best day school it that region and i was determined to pass regardless of the circumstance. i went through a sequence of struggles which among them was: the obvious tiresome journey, being sent home for fees and having low esteem due to being looked down upon by some students from well up families among other things including lack of cash to purchase novels, textbooks and such related staffs. i used to borrow books from friends and read them especially when they are not using them, my best subject is chemistry and nobody was beating me in this , i also loved English though it had “owners”. when i sat for my final exams which i really gave my best, i happened to pass the exam { not forgetting my friends who used to lend me books failed!!} i don't take pride in this but there is one thing that has been ringing in my mind ever since “God has a good purpose over my life. i really love god. i normally pray and i can say that god has done it in my life . in our great country we usually receive funds {loan} from the government and i used a small amount to erect a kiosk { small shop} for mum just near the road where we live to at least lighten the burden of hustle. i have a big dream over this family of ours .\n \nright now im writing this from a university library using computer number 31. i want to say that my dad died in 2008 six years after divorce out of brain cancer, a tumor had grown and started protruding towards the ear. m mum is a prayerful woman. i also loved my dad though i rarely had him. though non of my siblings have been able continue with education beyond high school level{including those from my step mother} i really thank god for his CHANCE to bring me this far,I'm training to be a chemistry and IT teacher currently in my second semester of third year.\n \ni have a dream of living in the US and help my family as well as my country.\n \ni know many might think that the number of children

My friends taught me how to use Facebook, Nimbuzz and YouTube.\n \nI requested my mother to make my father purchase a\nn\n Internet enabled phone. My mother asked about the cost of the same. I told 2–3 thousand for basic keypad and 4–5 thousand for screen touch phone. Firstly my mother refused to help me. But later when I told her that all my friends having internet enabled screen touch phone for study, at least you should talk about basic keypad phone.\n \nMy mother told the same to my father. After 1–2 week later I again asked my mother. My mother any how gave me 5,000 Rupees. I want to ask my mother..but she scold me …not to ask any question. I didn't purchase any phone and put back that money in my mother's wallet. Next day my mother was asking about my phone, I replied …Nhi mummy, main dosto k phone se hi kaam Chala lunga. Mere admission ke liye Kam aa jayenge wo rupye ( \nNo, I can manage with my friend's phone.

I tried to search all those things what I want to.. earlier.\n \nMy father asked me …what have you thought about your next study. I told my father, I want to take admission in B.Tech. Banks are providing Education Loan easily now a days.\n \nI took admission in a private college which was near to my home because if I take admission far away from my home. It will be more expensive.\n \nTwo of my friends also pursuing b.tech in that college. We all three go to college by one old hero motorcycle and expenses were equally divided.\n \nI never thought about the expenditures except college fee, I used to suffer economically by stationary, books and assignments expenses. I was consuming half of my family income.\n \nI sold my Nokia 5233 which helping me a lot in study especially assignments.\n \nDay by day my family’s economic condition going down.\n \nI started to teach my neighbor's children to earn some money to bear college expenses.

One of my elder sister awaiting to get married.\n \nI think to quit my study and start submitting some forms for government Job. (\nAlso there was a rumour that time , future of b.tech \nis \nnot secure as there are many students wandering after b.tech\n). So I strongly start believing in that.\n \nI appeared in many exam for government Job, many of my classmates also doing same. They think a government peon is far better than a unemployed engineer.\n \nFinally I got a call letter from (don't want to mention organization’s name). My parents want to stop me to join that service but there is one more problem our paternal house divided in four parts and my father got only 25 square foot of land. It was also a necessity to build that part to live.

Seeing no other option I joined that service. Now I am not saying that… I m earning good (what I want) but I am capable to carry all the responsibility of my family.

Before this one kid got there, nobody ever said “the n-word” mainly because there was absolutely no occasion for it. Anyway, we’re in Social Studies class, and this kid was apparently idly perusing the world map in the textbook, maybe the first time in his life he’d seen such a map, when he discovered the African nation of Niger. So of course, apropos of nothing, in the middle of class, this kid bursts out yelling “Ni99ER!!” Not once but several times. Like he was having a fit, a racist paroxysm.\n \nThe kid just could not believe that there was an African nation named “Niger” which he pronounced with a hard ‘g’. The teacher explained that it was pronounced as Niger, not “Nigger” and tried to explain something about the root of the word… The kid laughed, and cackled, and from that day forward referred to black people as “Nigers” and cackled hysterically about it. For a couple years, until we graduated, it seemed like that kid’s main interest in life was ridiculing the fact that a nation called Niger existed, and conflating that with the ‘n-word’ in every way possible. Oh, and for some weird reason, that kid always shouted and repeated the word “Flagstaff” whenever he heard it said by anyone else, in any context. He seemed to find the word ‘Flagstaff’ inherently hysterical, and after compulsively repeating it, he’d sit there and chuckle, shake his head, and marvel at the existence of such a place name for quite a while. “FLAGSTAFF!!! Harharhar”. Every. Single. Time. Niger and Flagstaff, endless amusement. That kid laughed constantly, mainly about those two things, demonstrating that ignorance really is bliss.\n \nOh, I just remembered another incident with that kid. In shop class, he was watching this other kid rip a 2x4 in half on the huge table saw. It was a long 2x4, ten feet or so, and when the kid finished the cut, the cutoff piece got trapped between the fence and blade, and that was a huge, powerful, industrial saw. It launched that 2x2 off the saw _hard_ and fast. I was standing there watching everything, off to the side. There were really grisly photos on the walls of that shop class of the possible injuries we could inflict on ourselves (or indeed on others) with the tools in the shop, and I took heed, was cautious and safety-oriented, and thankfully avoided injury. Our Southern friend, not so much. He had a cavalier attitude toward safety, and in this instance stood directly in line with the blade, and with the wood, so as to better observe the cut the other kid was making. Southern boy had his thumbs hooked in his belt, or his pockets, or something, elbows out, feet wide apart, when the lumber got launched off the saw, and it hit him right in the pubic bone. He went flying backward, crumpled over, folded in half, and hit a metal electrical box behind him so hard he dented it in, then collapsed. He was okay. I saw him in the shower later, and he had a square bruise where it hit him, bloody, green, purple…. It hit him really, really hard. It if would have been a couple inches lower, something awful would have happened, but it looked like it nearly broke his pubic bone. He said it was very painful. I made a mental note to keep staying out of the way of any possible launched hazards, and I’ve tried to live by that. Hopefully that kid learned some lessons, too. Though I kinda doubt it.\n \nThen, later in life, I actually spent some time in the Deep South, Georgia among other places. I worked for a plumber, so I was a plumber’s helper, technically. I’ve never seen anything like that. The guy I was working for was the most rabidly racist caricature of a Southerner imaginable. Literally every time we saw a black person while driving around, he’d have to call them an n-word. Since there were hundreds of black people about in Georgia, the guy spent about half his verbal output going niggerniggerniggernigger…. It was ridiculous. And every single time he saw a woman, any woman, he would say “I’d _FUCK_ her!” like a robot, every time.\n \nBut when he wasn’t being horribly racist or sexist, he was usually moaning in pain and begging for death. He took pills during the day, alarmingly often, for gastric distress. He moaned and clutched his belly “Oh Gawd damn it hurts! Ah wanna die it hurts so bad! Gawddamn pills ain’t no help neither!” After a couple days of this...", "authorship": "human"}

One of the other students looked at us, very sincerely, and she asked: “Why are we, like, learning about languages and stuff?” (That’s word for word what she said.)\nYou don’t really notice how noticeable Americans are until you encounter them abroad. The most memorable event was while waiting for a flight in the airport in Lima, Peru, and there was a parade of about 20 Americans with enough luggage to fill the plane themselves. I’d been speaking Spanish for a few months and not really thinking about people back home, so it was a slight culture shock to have this many Americans around again. As they walked past, dragging their many suitcases, one of them turned to the group and said (paraphrased): “Oh my god, everyone is speaking Spanish around here!” They clearly were not happy about how Peru wasn’t doing a better job of making them feel more comfortable as annoying tourists. It was very clear that was not an exclamation of excitement about being immersed in a new language and culture, as I might have said it. They were obviously angry.\nIn Puerto Rico, in the capitol building, they have a copy of the constitution of Puerto Rico on display in a glass case. A father and son walk up, and the son looks very interested, trying to read the document. The father pulls him away and sternly says (paraphrased) “No, that’s the \nSpanish one\n. Where’s the real one?”\nThis one gets honorable mention not because it’s the most ignorant thing I’ve heard but because it was apparently a recurring problem. When I was studying Swahili at a major university, the instructor had to repeatedly remind the students (based on homework I guess, and a couple priceless comments in class) that Africa is a continent and not a single country. This continued into the second year. (It probably didn’t help that they’d talk about things like vague “African culture” in class, but still.)\nAlso, not trying to be picky about word use, but just paying attention to nuances, I’d like to point out that \nignorant\n is a weird word. It just means\n not knowing\n. We’re all incredibly ignorant, of so many things. And while we’d like to learn more, being ignorant in that sense isn’t bad. The objection I have— and I think how most people usually use the word, especially to say \na person is ignorant,\n rather than being ignorant of something specific— is when someone appears to be intentionally ignorant, intentionally unaware of things in the world around them, uninterested in learning from others or questioning their assumptions. The most ignorant I’ve ever felt is when starting to study a new language, but it’s an exciting feeling of potential and curiosity, not time to shut off my brain.\n \nUpdate\n: as another ‘bonus’ I realized there’s something I forgot to mention before that I had intended to include.\n \nMe\n. Or actually all Americans. I’m a relatively educated and curious American who probably knows more than average. But as a habit, we Americans just don’t know some topics very well, such as geography and even our own politics and history. And I know those things fairly well, or at least I thought I did. Then I traveled to some other countries and I found out just how surprisingly much they know. First, of course they know a lot more about their country than I do, sometimes maybe more about their country than I know about mine, and typically world geography too. But more than that,\n they know so much about my country!\n I’m lucky if I can name the president of their country, but they know mine and a number of other government officials, and many past presidents. And they ask questions. Specific questions. I remember one time when I was with a friend in Ecuador, and he was reading a book about Abraham Lincoln. I was living in Illinois at the time when I took this trip, and he immediately connected that Abraham Lincoln was from Illinois. Suddenly he had dozens of questions, most of which I couldn’t answer. And I do know some things about Lincoln. This wasn’t an isolated incident either. So just keep that in mind. Makes you think twice about the idea of an American-knowledge citizenship test that most Americans couldn’t pass but many foreigners, who aren’t planning to take it, could. (Of course I’ve been asked silly questions about America too, if you’re wondering. But less often than you’d think. The best I’ve heard, indirectly, was someone who asked “Oh, California? Is that near Hollywood?”. That was in England, so maybe it reaffirms our shared origins.)", "authorship": "human"}

Today there are millions of helping tools and everyone is empowered to create a blog. The only question that is still hovering in the air is - \nhow to start a successful blog?\n \nSo let’s go - here are some tips for those who are just starting and even for those who already have a blog:\nChoose your blog niche.\n It’s easy to start a blog if you already know what you want to talk about but even if you don’t have your own topic, don’t give up - there are numerous bloggers who started with one idea and ended up with the other one. \nYou are creating a company or have a product? Writing a blog about it could become a great marketing strategy that would drag more attention to your business.\nHave something for the start.\n A lot of people start a blog without even knowing what to write about, it’s not the end of the world but surely you can do better! \nBefore starting a blog, gather up some materials around you that can be used in the blog - photos, some thoughts written down. Having something for the start obligates you to create a blog and not procrastinate with only thought about having it.\nSelect an interesting domain name.\n Forget all the boring ones and find a name that stands out. There are some interesting TLDs for your domain, you don’t have to use .com, with imagination you can make even .online TLD attractive!\nAlso, these tips can help to select the best domain name for you: \nMake the domain memorable\n - keep it short and simple, you can use domain checkers to help you find the one that fits you best!\n \nKnow your audience\n - domain target keywords are really important to your audience so make it relevant.\n \nLess but better\n - avoid any hyphens, numbers or non-unicode characters in the domain name. It could be too difficult to remember or hard to understand.\n \nCheck for popular keywords\n - with the domain checker you can find domains with popular keywords. Also, it can help you find domains with the same name and variations, buying those can help you to protect your brand.\n \nProtect your privacy\n - make sure that privacy protection is activated for your domain name. This will hide your private data from the WHOIS database.\n \nBe fast to be first\n - hurry up as the domain you want can be bought within seconds!\nAnalyze the blogs you like.\n It is so much easier to start with an example. I am not talking about copying others, just getting some inspiration and finding successful methods. Don’t forget to analyze which blogs are getting the most traffic - SimilarWeb can help you out with that. If a blog is getting a lot of traffic, research what could be the key factors of that. \nYou can even analyze the SEO strategy of other websites! \nNeil Patel\n allows you to do that through his own website.\nRemember that SEO is important but Content is still the king.\n No one ever got traffic without doing anything BUT it doesn’t mean that expensive ads will give you what you want. The most important thing here is content and you need to \nmake sure it’s rock-solid\n, though \nSEO\n is also playing a huge role in blogging.\nSet up social media platforms.\n Online presence is important and using social media can help you increase your user engagement. It’s the best tool to notify people about new articles and plans. Facebook and Instagram can help you grow and receive feedback from your readers directly. Also, you can implement the links from your blog post to Facebook and Instagram to gain more followers there and create a community for them. \nAs social media channels (and even effective ones) the personal profiles can be used too. A lot of bloggers have their blogs linked in the “About me” section of their Facebook and Instagram profiles. Self-promotion for friends and followers can increase traffic and popularity.\nCreate a top-notch design.\n Even when content is so important, you have to make sure that your visitors can easily read it and find it. The eye-catching design is a must to keep the readers in the blog for more than a few seconds. You can create a design yourself, or you can use existing templates - WordPress has a lot of them! If you have no idea about the latest trends, give a shot for a minimalistic look. It will make your blog look more professional and easy to navigate.\nCongrats! Now your blog is ready to storm the internet. Be sure to keep it updated and it will stay on the successful path. Here Google Analytics and other platforms that help to track your blog growth or plan its future will come in handy. \nA goal without a plan is just a wish, so make it real and enjoy the journey!", "authorship": "human"}

You can also do moderate and vigorous cardio at the same time.\nResistance exercises (lifting or bodyweight exercises) should target major muscle groups 2-3 times a week.\nFlexibility training should be done 2-3 times a week to improve range of motion.\nNeuromotor exercise (functional fitness) should be performed 2-3 days a week. Examples include balance, agility, coordination and gait exercises.\nHow you meet (or exceed) these guidelines is up to you. It’s probably easiest to split your workouts into cardio, 2-3 times a week for flexibility/neuromotor/strengthening 2-3 days a week. You should also include at least one day off each week in your exercise program.\n \nWhere do you start?\nHow often you should exercise depends on where you start exercising. Are you new to exercising? It’s best to ask your healthcare team where you should start exercising. In general, exercising 2-3 times a week can be a good start. Once this is possible, you can add more exercise each week. Remember, your main goal is to do any exercise you can, and it’s better than nothing.\nDon’t be discouraged if you don’t start your exercise program with the recommended amount of exercise. Any exercise is good for health. If you have a specific fitness goal, your weekly workouts may look different. For example, if you’re training for an endurance event, you’ll be doing more cardio than the ACSM recommends. If you’re trying to increase your strength specifically, your focus on strength training may be greater, possibly over half the guidelines.\n \nDo strength training 2-3 times a week\nWhatever your fitness goals, you should incorporate strength training into your workouts. Strength training should include a wide variety of exercises and equipment targeting all major muscle groups. In general, it is recommended to perform 2-4 sets of movements per muscle group with 8-12 repetitions.\nOlder adults or those just starting out should do lower-intensity workouts with sets of 10-15 repetitions. A common misconception about strength training is that you need a gym membership. You can do many strength training exercises with your body weight anywhere. For example, push-ups, squats, sit-ups, and sit-ups are all examples of strength exercises that you can do anywhere.\n \nHow much cardio should you do?\nThe ACSM guidelines of 2.5 hours of moderate exercise per week can be broken down in different ways:\n5 days a week, 30 minutes each time (can be completed in 10 minutes)\n3 days a week, 60 minutes each time (30 minutes above the guideline)\nCombination of moderate to high intensity exercise\nDepending on your goals and your starting point, you need to do how much cardio and what types of exercise. Examples of moderate exercise include: walking, jogging, dancing, gardening, football, etc. Moderate exercise can be sustained without leaving you out of breath. The heart rate increases, but this rate can be maintained for a while.\n \nHow Much Flexibility and Stretching Should You Do?\nExercise recommendations tend to focus on strength training and cardio. However, flexibility and neuromotor exercises should not be forgotten. Flexibility and neuromotor training can easily be combined before or after strength training or cardio.\nFor example: stretching before and after exercise, dynamic warm-ups, yoga, Pilates and balance exercises. Muscles should be warm before doing stretches. Hold the stretch for 10-30 seconds and repeat 2-4 times.\n \nFollow us:\nhttps://lifebuddy.siterubix.com/", "authorship": "human"}

Whether you're looking to shed some pounds, build muscle, or boost your overall health, finding the right workout is key to sustaining motivation and achieving your goals. Let's dive into the world of fitness and shed light on how to choose the best workout tailor-fitted to your needs and lifestyle.\n \nUnderstanding Your Fitness Goals\n \nBefore jumping into the latest fitness craze, it's essential to get a clear understanding of what you want to achieve. Here's how to set realistic and personal goals:\nWeight Loss:\n If your aim is to lose weight, focus on workouts that enhance \ncardiovascular health\n and burn significant calories, such as HIIT, running, or spinning classes.\nMuscle Gain:\n For those looking to gain muscle mass, strength training and resistance exercises like weightlifting or bodyweight exercises will be your go-to.\nEndurance Building:\n Sports such as swimming, cycling, or long-distance running can increase your stamina and improve heart and lung function.\nFlexibility and Balance:\n Yoga and Pilates provide a perfect blend of stretching and core workouts to enhance these areas.\nOnce your goals are outlined, consider how each workout aligns with your lifestyle and how they can be incorporated into your daily regime.\n \nConsidering Workout Preferences and Lifestyle\n \nYour workout should not only meet your fitness goals but also jive with your interests and schedule. Consistency will become infinitely easier if you enjoy the process. Ask yourself:\nDo you prefer solitary workouts where you can go at your own pace, like jogging or solo weight training sessions?\nAre group classes such as Zumba, spinning, or CrossFit more motivating and fun for you?\nDoes your routine allow long workout periods, or are shorter, more intense sessions like Tabata training better?\nBalance is vital—not just on the yoga mat but also in scheduling workouts that fit into your life seamlessly.\n \nWorkout Types: Pros, Cons, and Who They're Best For\n1. HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training)\n \nPros:\nEfficient, burns many calories in a short period\nBoosts metabolism for hours after the workout\nCons:\nMay be challenging for beginners\nHigher risk of injury if not done with proper form\nBest for:\n Individuals with limited time seeking fast results.\n \n2. Cardiovascular Exercises (Running, Cycling)\n \nPros:\nImproves heart health and burns calories\nCan be done anywhere\nCons:\nCan be monotonous\nImpact on joints\nBest for:\n Beginners to advanced; those who enjoy outdoor activities.\n \n3. Strength Training (Gym Workouts, Calisthenics)\n \nPros:\nBuilds muscle and strength\nIncreases metabolism\nCons:\nRequires equipment or gym access\nProgress may be slower\nBest for:\n Those looking to tone up or increase strength.\n \n4. Yoga and Pilates\n \nPros:\nImproves flexibility and core strength\nReduces stress\nCons:\nMay not burn as many calories\nRequires patience and discipline\nBest for:\n Individuals seeking a low-impact option focusing on mental and physical well-being.\n \nIncorporating Recovery and Nutrition\nRemember that the best workout routine is incomplete without proper recovery and nutrition. Always schedule rest days to allow your body to recover, and fuel your workouts with a balanced diet rich in proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and micronutrients. Hydration is also non-negotiable—keep the water flowing!\n \nConclusion\n \nThe best workout for you is one that you enjoy, that fits your lifestyle, and that moves you towards your fitness objectives. Assess your preferences, experiment with different types, and listen to your body's responses. Dedication to progress rather than perfection will lead to sustainable health benefits and personal satisfaction.\n \nRemember to consult with fitness professionals and possibly get a health check-up before starting a new workout regime. Their guidance can help you modify workouts to your level, increasing both effectiveness and safety.\n \nAs you begin this journey, celebrate every step forward. Whether it's a faster mile, a heavier lift, or simply the discipline to show up to your yoga mat—each accomplishment is a testament to your commitment to a healthier you.\n \nBegins with these \n5 key principles you must apply\n in order to STOP the rapid onset of aging that's going on right now, reverse it, and begin \"aging backwards\" by restoring your body's natural youth hormones.", "authorship": "human"}

He is a totally undeserved blessing that is beyond my comprehension as to why I was gifted with him.\n \nOffspring are blessings, so that is one important, non-monetary measurement.\n \nFurther, I received the “\"gift of faith” in Christ, as a child, and I am persisting in my very flawed and unremarkable pursuit of as much of what I know He wants me to be, have and do as I know how to and that I have the willingness to cooperate with him to pursue.\n \nAnother important yardstick.\n \nThird, I have reasonably good health and was given strength in the physical part of life, though the strong appetites that often accompany generally good health I have exploited to my disadvantage.\n \nNow, by the world’s standards, I have clean-enough water to bathe in; I buy distilled water to drink and cook with; I have 650 square feet with a roof over it all, and doors that have yet to be breached, despite the higher incidence of crime where I live; I have “\"stuff,” like an old smart phone, a 32″ tv, an old laptop, some worn out clothes.\n \nPretty rich, as compared to literally 4/5ths or more of the world’s population. But, as compared to what my parents had when they were my age (I’m 59), I am hardly “\"eking our” a living and there is little hope for financial security in my fast-approaching “old age.”\n \nI have no car (unlike 95% of my city’s population), nothing in the bank, my glasses are 14 years old and taped together on both sides; I also haven't seen a doctor or a dentist for 14 years; and the last time I wore a pair of shoes that were new, decent, department-store shoes was when my son was four years old (18 years ago), when my sister decided to take me shopping and buy me some nice things.\n \nI walk and bicycle the two miles to my job, a job which requires me to stand all day and leaves me so tired and sore at the end of the day that I am hardly able to do anything once I get home, or on my days off.\n \nIs it poverty to not be able to go to a good doctor?

And who don’t by any means have “all” their basic needs met because that would crowd out the pleasant self-satisfaction that the richer enjoy on a daily basis, as they get hair cuts and dental work and dinners out that the “poor” cannot afford to count on to lift their spirits or buoy their resolve for tomorrow’s demands.\n \nProverbs 29:2 in the bible says: “When the righteous rule, the people rejoice; but when the wicked are on top, the people mourn.” I think the number of people who are mourning in America is getting larger and has been doing so for about 45 years.\n \nIf you live in the US, the next time you see a stranger ask yourself ‘How can I tell for sure when the last time was that that person had a good meal?’\n \nFOOTNOTE: In the Colorado county where I live (El Paso), and where the headquarters of Focus on the Family, and Compassion International, and International Bible Study, and The Navigators, are located, all world- renown Christian organizations, one-third of all school aged children go to bed hungry every night.\n \nAre they as hungry as Mali’s 7.5 million kids under 15 years of age who are often left with no option other than to turn tricks for the ones with money so they can keep “earning” their right to stay at the mosque where the local imams bring one child of every household to serve Allah?\n \nProbably not.\n \nBut can a country who doesn't feed it's own children anymore qualify as a leader of the free world?

Not exactly deep or original stuff…I’d consider having my room paid for all weekend a pretty good deal tbh.\n \nAnyway, someone in our group had been penfriends with her and even met her once or twice, and we arranged a meal with about 10 people attending. When time for the meal came, Ms Primadonna had not shown up. She sent a message she was still coming. Everyone sat down, but didn’t order as it would be rude if we started before she got there. Time goes by…lots of time. Another message comes—she has a migraine, but she’s still coming. We wait. And wait. Another half hour or more goes by. We are now all starving and not sure what to do. Then ta-da, Primadonna finally swans into the room and plonks herself at the head of the table like a queen. No hello for anyone, a miserable, sour face. (OK, she had a migraine—why not just cancel if she felt that bad? I am a migraineur myself—doesn’t turn me into a jerk.)\n \nShe grabs the menu, more facial grimaces. “Ugh, I don’t like any of this…and guess what, when I went to the drugstore they don’t have the same painkillers as in America! I’m not taking anything foreign! I can’t believe i can’t get proper drugs!”\n \nSilence started to fall over the table. Her tone was petulant, unfriendly and accusatory. Being mostly Brits/Canadians and a little more reserved than she was, no one said, “Why would you think you’d get the same painkillers?’ although you could tell everyone was thinking it.\n \nShe continued to moan about the menu and didn’t order; the rest of us finally ordered food. Primadonna didn’t seem to like the fact no one was continuously fussing about her headache/lack of drugs and suddenly said, “I have to go’ and disappeared from the restaurant. We tried to make excuses for her because she felt unwell but…\n \nShe was back at it the next day. I was going to buy her book but ahead of me, I saw a fan go up to her table, buy her stuff then ask for a photograph of her. She flung up a hand to her head in a melodramatic way like some dame in a panto. “Go on but I’ve had a headache…” she whined, all passive aggressive, making her FAN seriously uncomfortable and embarrassed.( There are nicer ways to say ‘no’, and if you are attending an event, you are in the public eye. Not one of the real celebs attending were anything like this.)\n \nLater on Primadonna cornered my friend ( the penfriend) while she was walking in the hall with me and another lady. Now came the really cringey stuff. “There…there is DUST in my room,” she said, almost tremulously as if about to cry. Her lower lip was so outthrust in a pout, I thought she might trip on it. “I ran my finger along the ledge and saw it on my fingertip.”\n \n(This was an old building, her room was free, and if there was dust in her room, it wasn’t in mine or anyone else’s!)\n \n“Couldn’t you ask housekeeping to clean it?” my friend mumbled.\n \nPrimadonna rolled her eyes to heaven. “This is terrible! Dust! They can’t treat me like this! They can’t do this to me-I’M AN AMERICAN!”\n \nThere were three of us there besides Primadonna. A stunned silence fell. No one quite knew where to look after this cringe-worthy outburst.\n \nMe and one other English girl hastily made our excuses and left the hall, unable to bear it anymore. The girl looked at me once we were out of earshot and started to laugh, “What a horrible, entitled, rude person!”\n \nWe avoided Primadonna after that but heard her tell people she was a black belt in karate, which seemed pretty implausible given her rather, um, unfit physique and the fact that every ache, pain or inconvenience was a big issue.\n \nLater we heard she could not cope with the U.K. and cut her whole ‘research’ trip short and went home to the US early, losing loads of money! I guess she couldn’t handle the fact no one was falling all over her, catering to every whim just because she was American and wrote some fanfics.\n \nLater the friend who’d met her in the past said, “I have no idea why she was freaking out about the dust. Her own house is full of brimming cigarette trays and she has about 20 cats!”", "authorship": "human"}

I’ve never seen so many pine trees in all my life, rolling endlessly like waves on the ocean across barren mountains.\n \nI was camping near Golden in the summer months, staying at a campsite with a few other travellers. This was when I used to do hitchhiking up the Trans-Canada Highway.\nIn this campsite were a variety of different travellers from across the world. Some were Canadian, a few Australians, there was a German, Spaniard and a couple of Americans.\n \nWe were isolated. Our campsite was deep in the mountains. I saw black bears and all sorts of other mammals. Everyone was naturally curious about black bears, afraid of being mauled to death but also very eager to get a photograph of them.\n \nI remember prepping for hours about how I would react in case a bear approached me, looking for its next meal. I knew how to roll on the ground, stand tall and shout, pop off a firecracker and I read up on how to use bear spray if it came to it.\nNow enters one of the most idiotic individuals I have ever met.\n \nLet’s call him Captain Know-it-All.\nCaptain Know-it-All had lectured us for the last two nights around the campfire about how he was a ‘citizen of the world’ (whatever that means) in one of the thickest Californian accents I’ve encountered. He also told us about the wilderness as if he were a pioneer explorer.\n \nCaptain Know-it-All seemed to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of the outdoors, especially wilderness survival. Yet he was very gaunt and seemed to have only left his daily outing to the coffee shop for the first time on this trip. He was very slim, lanky, tall like a giraffe with long hair and a drawn out face.\n \nWe were all developing headaches as he tried to impress us. His Romanian girlfriend only encouraged him on, inflating his ego to mountainous proportions.\nAround his waist at all times was a tool belt containing every piece of kit you can think, including a small hatchet that was impossible to cut anything with and a strange admixture of blunt instruments except for a sharp hunter’s knife which was far too dangerous for this person to carry.\n \nHe also had fire starters dangling from the belt, a compass in case he strayed ten metres from his car, and all manners of other rubbish he was never going to use. The only thing this absurd tool belt was going to do was weigh him down when a bear’s stomach grumbled. However, out of all these tools, Captain Know-it-All’s most prized possession was a canister of bear-spray.\nI was actually told by an expert wilderness survivalist who lived alone in the Canadian mountains to not carry bear spray with me when hiking. I thought this was counterintuitive, but he explained that many of the people who try to use it have absolutely no idea how to safely discharge a canister.\n \nProblems include not only being unable to aim at a fast moving bear charging towards you, but missing the target, not opening it fast enough or misjudging wind direction. You can’t just fire glorified pepper spray into strong winds and \nnot\n be throughly coated in eye-burning liquids. This expert judged that those with little experience are more likely to hurt themselves with bear spray than have any successful chance of hurting the bear.\n \nThe best tips for a black bear encounter are not to run away, but to make yourself big by waving both arms and creating loud noises. This will scare off black bears most of the time rather than blinding yourself with bear spray and potentially aggravating a black bear with the spray.\nNow back to Captain Know-it-All.\n \nThis ‘citizen of the world’ (who was very eager to apologise for being American) was packing his belongings for a day of hiking with his Romanian girlfriend. In the boot of their car, they were arranging everything for the hike as if they were trekking to the Grand Canyon and back.\n \nOf course, as they both fiddled with the bear spray, they somehow managed to spray each other in the face and eyes whilst knee deep in the boot of their car.\nSafe to say, they didn’t go hiking that day.", "authorship": "human"}

If you want the quality of The Rock or Matt Bomer's washboard abdominal muscles, or the speed or agility of Usain Bolt or Cam Newton, you have to work. If your goals are not so lofty (you want to feel good, maybe lose a few pounds, or just keep your place), then you still have to figure out how the fitness class will fit your life. Don't worry, through these strategies, no matter what kind of fitness \"guy\" you are, we can cover everyone.\nFor the guy who has no free time\n \nWe see, you are very busy, and sometimes the gym falls at the bottom of the to-do list. Sorry to say that if you are serious about health and wellness, it will not happen. When you seem to have spoken all the hours of the day, you must find ways to increase efficiency. For example, bring lunch so you can spend half of your rest time on exercise and the other half on eating. Or consider becoming an early riser so that you can exercise before life happens, and then suddenly finish the exercise.\n \nShort\n \nThe good news: exercise does not have to take a few hours to take effect. \"The minimum effective amount of exercise is 4 minutes, which is the time for a drum exercise,\" said Josh Holland, a trainer in New York City and founder of Zoomtion Fitness. So, why not start your day with squats or push-ups (20 seconds, 10 seconds rest, 8 reps) while making coffee?\n \nHard to go home\n \nThis is not to say that long-term exercise will not bring more benefits, although Holland said that you only need 20 to 30 minutes, especially when you are training hard. His favorite is your best partner, including slow repetitive high-intensity strength training, aerobic sprinting and endurance isometric tests.\n \nThis weight loss routine is the perfect partner exercise\n \nA cry for you\n \nStrengthen Strength: Choose 5 to 7 multi-joint exercises (such as front squat, overhead press, bench press, low row exercise and pull down exercise), and perform slow repetitive exercises (concentric and eccentric) for about one and a half minutes for each exercise Exercise 5-6 seconds), respectively. Holland said: \"The weight should be heavy enough to make you tired.\"\n \nFor aerobic exercise: choose aerobic exercise mode (running, biking, rowing, even skipping). Go all out for 12 to 15 seconds. Indeed not, do your best, this is not a half-way time. Recover up to one minute (up to three minutes), and then recover 6 to 10 times. Holland said: \"When your distance starts to shrink, then it's time for you to quit.\"\n \nFor long-lasting: This fast exercise can be done in your living room using your own body weight. Use wall sitting, planks, handstands or spear rests and lunges rest to create isometric circuits. Move continuously for 1 minute at a time and complete the loop as much as possible until the table fails. Make it more difficult by extending the time.\n \nFor those who are not motivated\n \nFor whatever reason, when you stretch your hips toward the gym, you seem to be dragging your feet. It’s not that you are afraid of it, but because it’s much easier to procrastinate or get yourself into work, such as Netflix or aimless web surfing or coworkers’ happy hours, and suddenly, you are not for the week.\n \nSet a goal\n \nYou’ve heard it before, but if you don’t have a clear intention, it’s difficult to measure progress and you don’t even have the motivation to try. Add numbers to it, such as the specific weight loss you want to achieve within a specific time period (remember that 2 pounds a week is considered healthy and sustainable). Or consider the goal of skill or strength: perfect skipping leg training, lift body weight (or 1.5 times or twice the body weight) on the bench or deadlift, pull up 10 or 20 pull-ups, master the muscles, and start Exercise the number of miles within a certain time frame and so on. \"Using test and retest models,\" Holland said. Set a benchmark and then conduct a self-test once a week or every two weeks to assess progress.\n \nLet others hold you accountable\n \nAn exercise partner who is already a gym rat may be your new best friend. Cheer him up by asking for his opinion, suggesting to provide a whistleblower, or keeping up with him, you need someone to whip your ass. Or even promise to pay for the smoothie after exercise to help you get up and drag you there, and don’t let him refuse.", "authorship": "human"}

Whether you do yoga, go for a run or lift some weights, getting your sweat on in the morning is a great way to set the tone for the day.\n \n- Lunch break: If you can't get away for a full workout, try squeezing in a quick fitness routine during your lunch break. A 20-30 minute walk or jog is a great way to break up the day and get your blood flowing.\n \n- Evening routine: Dedicate time at the end of the day for fitness. This could be 30 minutes of cardio or an hour-long strength training session. If you have time constraints in the evening, try mixing and matching different workouts to create a shorter routine.\n \n5. What are good ways to stay active even if you can't work out?\n \nEven if you can't always make it to the gym or go for a run, there are plenty of other ways to stay active. In fact, simply incorporating more movement into your day can help burn calories and improve your overall fitness level. Here are a few ideas to get you started:\n \n1. Park your car at the far end of the lot.\n \n2. Take the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator.\n \n3. Walk or ride your bike to work or school instead of driving.\n \n4. Do some squats or lunges during your commercials breaks.\n \n5. Take a brisk walk in your neighborhood after dinner.\n \n6. Use a fitness tracker to monitor your daily activity level.\n \nConclusion:\n \nWe all know how important it is to stay active and fit, but sometimes life gets in the way. With a little bit of creativity and organisation, though, you can find time to work out – no matter how busy you are. These tips will help you make time for fitness, so you can stay healthy and looking great.", "authorship": "human"}

You can achieve just about anything with the weight of your own body. But, sometimes it’s hard without equipment and dumbbells are a great choice. They are versatile and even portable.\n \nSo, let’s get into it.\n \nIn order to shorten this answer and not repeat myself, I won’t write about basic bodyweight training. Here’s an answer where I go in depth about this:\n \nLazar Nikolic's answer to What is the best way to build muscles at home?\n \nFirst of all, if you don’t have a\n pull-up bar\n, these dumbbells might come in handy – curl variations (for biceps), dumbbell rows (narrow for lats, wider for rear delts) etc. But I highly suggest you try to save up for a pull-up bar, or at least find one in your neighborhood. Or use something else that’s strong enough for you to hold onto. Pull-ups are one of the staples of bodyweight training.\n \nThis leads us to another point from the previous answer: muscles you can’t easily target without equipment. \nCalves\n, for example, are used to the weight of your body, but using 20 kg of dumbbells as a resistance just might create initial overload. Don’t try to exercise your \nmiddle delts\n with these, though. I’m almost certain you won’t be able to handle so much weight in a side lateral raise.\n \nBut, the beauty of dumbbells is this – you can make any exercise harder or easier with these. Let’s take this paragraph from the linked answer:\nMix push-ups and dips for the chest, front shoulders and triceps\nMix pull-ups and chin-ups for lats, biceps, rear delts and the upper back\nMix variations of leg raises, planks and crunches for abs and obliques\nDo lower back extensions for the lower back (spinal erectors)\nMix hip thrusts and glute bridges for the gluteus\nMix squats and lunges for quads\nYou can put a dumbbell (or both) in a backpack and create more tension on \ndips\n, \npush-ups \nor a \nplank\n. You can use one or both in \nsquats\n and \nlunges\n easily. You can make both \nhip thrusts\n and \nglute bridges\n harder with dumbbell(s). And you can hold one or both while doing \ncrunches \nor even hold one of them between legs in \npull-ups\n and\n leg raises\n when you get strong enough.\n \nBut making things harder is in perspective, first you need to create a strong base and develop proper form if you intend on adding weight. That’s where we start looking at things from a different perspective.\n \nIf \npush-ups\n are too hard, use dumbbells to do a \ndumbbell bench press\n. You don’t even need a bench, lay on the floor.\n \nHandstand push-ups\n are one of the best shoulder building exercises. But that’s way too hard, even for more experienced individuals. So, how to get there? Well, you can go through push-up progressions, but you can also strengthen these muscles doing \ndumbbell overhead press\n. In the beginning, use only one dumbbell and switch to both when you develop adequate strength. Just make sure you are familiar with proper form.\n \nIn the beginning, you probably won’t be able to \ncurl \n10 kg effectively either. So, again – use only one dumbbell. If that’s the case, that is.\n \nSo, in short – if you pair your two dumbbells with bodyweight training, you can definitely build more than enough muscle.\n \nI suggest you head off to \nAthlean-X\n YouTube channel and learn proper form of any exercise you want to do. You can also find great insight on \nCalisthenic Movement\n and\n FitnessFAQs\n YouTube channels.\n \nLearn new variations, both easier and harder, if you want to have a good, stable base for future training. Develop your whole body and stretch, so you don’t injure yourself.\n \nDon’t chase numbers, do your absolute best on every exercise and you’ll have results. Just make sure that you can safely do anything you set your mind to. Again – \nstudy proper form in detail before attempting anything\n.\n \nGood luck!\n \nEDIT\n: In some other answers, people said that these dumbbells will eventually get too light for you. That certainly is true. But, with good \nbodyweight variations\n, you can mitigate this “problem”. You can also change the way you move them in space –\n slow down\n, do \none and a half rep\n style training, do \n21's technique\n and more. Yes, expanding your equipment inventory would be beneficial, but that’s so far ahead of you that you don’t have to worry about that now. Cheers!", "authorship": "human"}

It will likely feel more fulfilling because exercise lowers the risk of anxiety and depression BH reducing levels of stress hormones like Cortisol and Arsenal.\n \nOf course , all of those benefits depends on the type and intensity of your workout and how long you exercise for each week.\n \nA balanced diet is also Paramount to a healthy lifestyle.\n \nFor the average adult ages 18 to 64 , the US Department of Health and Human Services recommends either a minimum of 2.5 hours per week of moderately intense exercise like brisk walking or biking.\nOr, at least 1 hour and 15 minutes each week that combines moderate and high intensity workouts like Running or Swimming sprints.\n \nOn top of that, make sure and take 2 days each week to strengthen your muscles with some weights or resistance training.\n \nThis will help your overall speed and endurance .\n \nAs you begin. Its important to pace yourself and not push too hard too fast or you risk serious injury.\nYou will discover that the fitter you become, the easier it will be to exert a little more energy the next week, the week after, and so forth.\n \nExercise smart and often.

Before that, I lived on a sofa in an apartment shared with two alcoholics/occasional crack smokers for $300/month and the internet was included. Before that, I had a job and was living in a $750/month bachelor apartment paying the aforementioned local isp $30/month for internet. Before that, I had no job and internet was included, before that it was included, before that it was included, before that it was included. If one pays rent, there is usually internet. Except for the bachelor, the one case where internet was not included, the duplex, was when the landlord was a literal psychopath.\n \nI have used Quora for 4–5 years. For the latter 3 of years I have been poor. I originally started using Quora to acquaint myself with tech culture. I was an arts major and wanted to find my way into the tech sector. I never found my way into the tech sector, but I was well prepared to witness the considerable changes seen in society on account of the almost unprecedented recent advancements in technology. I focused on learning to manage and save money until the information given through Quora became repetitive; my parents were not able to endow me with this perspective. After, I focused on ways to make money. I’ve found recurring viable methods which I believed were suitable for me mentioned. Investing in real estate. ecommerce. Trading stocks and currencies. Then I realized these all take initial resources to begin making money with. There are good reasons I’m poor and these methods are not for me at this time. This is where I’m at now.\n \nMany things I’ve realized through Quora have significantly shaped who I am as a person. There is a lot less uncertainty for me in regards to how money can be made, kept and spent. Before Quora, did I think a millionaire had access to whatever luxury? Probably yes. Now I know one million dollars is not a lot of money. Twenty million dollars is a lot of money, in my opinion. I’m given $1050/month through disability assistance, by the way. In any case, a millionaire does not necessarily have the ability to choose between all luxuries. I’ve learned ideas come and go. They don’t have to be trendy, sophisticated and certainly not world-changing to make money. Since I’m now focusing on making a living beginning with the amount of resources I have on hand, my most recent ideas for doing so have been focusing on growing a particular kind of mushroom and getting a newspaper route. I have seen the mushrooms sold in health food stores at a very high cost. I know the market on them is cornered. The mushrooms are esoteric, produced in a small amount of far off facilities and I believe I know how, discovered through local lore no less, to grow them more effectively. The newspaper route, I believe I might just be able to manage most immediately.\n \nSo- this poor person uses Quora with a focus on learning to make a living. Along with a close friend, this site helps me maintain momentum on the path to finding a career. I use it to learn, sometimes as a way to keep busy, to express myself. For perspective I did not have access to previously, inspiration, mentorship. I want to contribute to society while doing right by my needs, if you will, and clarifying both those ends is an ongoing process for me. Not to imply you think poor people may necessarily have distinct reasons for using Quora, but to state poor people have the same reasons for using Quora as those otherwise do; I am a curious and rational animal with internet access.", "authorship": "human"}

Your reaction is biologically logical.\n \nSo, what is the ideal dynamic? The answer is very simple: combine the two modalities in the same session or at different times but within the same day.

The best option is the circuits in which four or five different types of activities alternate with rest periods between series and series . Coaches say that without killing themselves and choosing the activity table, the body will notice in 66 days.\nPlan the session; Exhausting is not a guarantee of good results\n \nWhat is better, to train strength or resistance? We are facing the eternal question when it comes to exercising. We arise because we have little time in day to day and we want, logically, to get the most out of our activity. But choosing between both is a wrong view, since it leads us in most cases to the mistake of hitting an aerobic bludgeon, thinking that with it we will burn more fats , or routines with a lot of weight in order to gain more muscle.\n \nThe reality is that people who manage to train continuously do so on average twice a week and no more than forty minutes each time . With this average, if we want to generate significant changes in our body to improve health and aesthetics, we have to change our perspective. By focusing one day on muscle mass and another on aerobic exercises, the stimulus to which the body is subjected is insignificant, even if we end up exhausted.\nThe reason is that the organism does not know if it runs in front of a lion to survive - and is making an extra effort for it - or if it trains for a healthy goal. So, if you are sitting for eight hours or so many hours standing up and suddenly an intense and unordered physical activity is imposed, your tendency will be to protect yourself. It will neither burn more fat, nor generate more muscle; on the contrary, it will try to reserve itself and spend as little as possible, in case the effort is prolonged in time.

{"Article Number": 938, "title": "Is a morning gym workout better than an evening gym workout?", "article": "Let’s consider the advantages of both of them.\n \nWorking out in the A.M.\nConsistency\n: For some people, working out in the A.M. helps with consistency. This is because early in the morning is usually devoid of sudden commitments. Compare this to afternoon and evening workouts, when responsibilities may arise. Furthermore, a full day’s work can take a toll on our willpower, thus deterring us from going to the gym.\nBetter sleep\n: Since exercise increases heart rate and body temperature, working out too late in the evening (generally after 8 p.m.) may disrupt sleep.

This is because early in the morning is usually devoid of sudden commitments. Compare this to afternoon and evening workouts, when responsibilities may arise. Furthermore, a full day’s work can take a toll on our willpower, thus deterring us from going to the gym.\nBetter sleep\n: Since exercise increases heart rate and body temperature, working out too late in the evening (generally after 8 p.m.) may disrupt sleep. On the other hand, one study showed that working out at 7 a.m. (compared to 1 p.m. or 7 p.m.) may help people sleep more soundly at night.\nAvoiding crowds: \nFitness centers see the most traffic between 5 and 8 p.m., making it difficult to get the machine or group fitness class you really want. Mornings see less traffic, making A.M. workouts more efficient. Furthermore, early morning gym-goers tend to get in and get out within a fixed amount of time, leaving no room for socialization and clogging up the gym floor.\nStarting the day right:\n When you start a daily routine with exercise, you are more likely to set yourself up for a healthy domino effect throughout the day. Say, for example, you start the day at the gym. This is often followed by a healthy post-workout shake or snack and an increased water intake all morning long. Getting your workout in the morning makes it easier to incorporate a balanced breakfast into your schedule, setting you up for a day of healthy eating.\nWorking out in the P.M.\nStrength:\n If you are not a morning person, then you will definitely have more strength working out in the afternoon or the evening. After all, if you struggle to wake up in the first place, working out in the morning can result in the inability to concentrate (and injury!), which will decrease workout quality. On the opposite side of the coin, an individual who works out later in the day has the opportunity to eat and fuel his body for a tough workout.\nStress relief: \nMany people see exercise as a way to express their pent up stress throughout the day. Having an outlet, such as a kickboxing or personal training, at the end of the workday can provide a healthy way to release daily stresses.\nAccountability: \nIt’s generally easier to find a workout partner or personal trainer who is willing to meet you for an afternoon or evening workout than one who’s up for a 5 or A.M. weightlifting session.\nAvailability:\n While it is true that avoiding the crowds is a plus for many early morning gym-goers, the exact same reason can be a negative for other individuals. Gyms offer a larger variety of classes after work than in the morning hours. Plus, a packed post-work class may push you to compete against fellow gym-goers and work harder to get the most from your routine.\nWhat about RESULTS?\n \nIn terms of results, current studies suggest that \nworking out in the morning or in the evening can work just as well\n, depending on the individual. \nIt all comes down to workout quality and performance.\n \nAfter all, the advantages of working out in the morning vs evening all comes down to personal preference. \nThe most objective parameter is your individual performance\n. Other than that, no substantial research suggests that one is definitely better than the other.\n \nSo what should you do if you want to workout in the morning?\n \nYou should workout in the morning if:\nYou are a morning person. I.e. you feel energized and fresh enough early in the morning.\nYou feel fine working out in a fasted state. While you can still consume your pre-workout supplement, generally people who work out in the morning opt to have a proper breakfast after their workout session.\nYou should workout in the afternoon or evening if:\nYou are not a morning person.\nYour performance is impaired when training with an empty stomach. Indeed, most individuals find they perform better in the evening because they had a chance to get some meals in earlier in the day.\nDiscovering which one works best for you is easy: try both, and see how your body reacts in comparison.

Here is my list of 5 exercises everyone, not just beginners, should do to help with fundamentals for more complicated lifts.\nPush Ups - Push Ups are the bread and butter of any calisthenics/fitness oriented workout. Doing pushups will help your ability to bench press correctly and they are great for strengthening your back \nIF YOU DO THEM CORRECTLY! \nI recommend starting at a 3 x 15 but if you can only do 3 x 10, we all have to start somewhere. If you can already do 3 x 20 or 3 x 25, do that instead. I am doing 3 x 50, trying to get to 4 x 50.\nBodyweight squats - I know, bodyweight for anything isn’t as flashy as “LiFtInG mAd WeIgHtS bRo” but bodyweight squats, when done for high reps, will help strengthen and tone your quads which will then help when you actually perform squats with a higher weight. I personally do 3 x 40 for these but I’d start at 3 x 20 or 3 x 25 for someone just starting.\nCalf Raises - These can be done with bodyweight, dumbbells, or the machine at the gym. All 3 work great and unless you’re a neanderthal and don’t stretch beforehand, you shouldn’t get hurt doing these. These help with strengthening your calves (no shit) which will help with running for athletes and overall, aesthetically, I have had my calves commented on just as much as my upper body. I do 3 x 15 for these on the machine, but I load up the weight to 290 lbs. For bodyweight, I do around 3 x 30.\nBench Press - Bench press is probably the most common staple of any chest workout and for good reason. It not only helps with delivering a good pump to the pecs but it also seems to help with filling out the shoulders which for a lot of skinny guys working out is a huge plus. Dumbbells are great to start with as they teach balance and force you to use your pecs and not just your triceps and forearms to lift them. I do either 2 x 8 for this with 225 lbs or 3 x 12 with 165 pounds. I would start with a basic 3 x 10 with whatever weight you can do safely as a beginner.\nDeadlifts - Holy shit start light with this. People watch strongmen deadlift 1,000 pounds and they're like “Oh if they can do that then 300 is a breeze for me”. THAT IS THE WRONG APPROACH TO ANY WORKOUT LET ALONE ONE THAT CAN REALLY FUCK YOU UP IF YOU DO IT WRONG! This strengthens your back, core, quads, and triceps among many other muscles when done right. I do this 3 x 5 with 405 pounds. I have been doing these for 5 years though and have built up to that. Start at 135 pounds and do high reps to get your form down. There is no shame in doing these, or frankly any workout, with a coach or trainer to get your form down. Safety is more important than “MaD gAiNz BrO”.\nThis is not a definitive list and I am not a medical doctor or professional trainer. This is how I was trained for lacrosse and it has worked pretty well for me functionally and aesthetically ever since. Granted there are other workouts like curls that I mostly do to have some “flashy” muscle but otherwise, my workout is based around cardio endurance, strength, and being able to react quickly (which is more of a stretching thing but that’s a different topic for another time).\n \nFirst and foremost, workout to be healthy. Don’t try to be a pro bodybuilder unless you understand what it takes. By that I mean, are you willing to do steroids? Are you willing to eat waaaayyyyyy too much protein than is healthy? Are you willing to give up hours upon hours of time chasing a fleeting feeling that will never satisfy you even if you are the best in the world? If you can answer all of those with yes honestly the fine, you know the risks and that’s that.\n \n(BTW not knocking bodybuilders at all. Half of my lifting buddies are bodybuilders and they are some of the coolest people I know. It takes years of hard work, even with steroids, to get to that level. I can’t do bodybuilding because of my health as I already have high Test levels and I really don’t want to fuck with that. Also, my family is predisposed for heart complications and I have no desire to die at the age of 45 as my mom did from a heart attack).\n \nHope this helps,\n \nBen", "authorship": "human"}

Well, that depends on what you’re looking for—flavor, health, or just pure yumminess. Instead of writing about my favorite ingredients, I shared detailed information about sandwiches so you can decide what you want to include in your own creation. Let’s dive into some top picks for building the ultimate sandwich!\n1. The Protein Powerhouse\n \nEvery great sandwich needs a good protein. Protein keeps you full and helps build and repair your muscles. Here are some all-star options:\nGrilled Chicken or Turkey:\n Lean and flavorful, these options are perfect for a light, healthy sandwich. Add some mustard or avocado for extra zing!\nEggs:\n Hard-boiled or scrambled, eggs are a classic. They’re rich in protein and vitamins, and they go well with almost anything.\nPlant-Based Proteins:\n For veggie lovers, try hummus, tempeh, or even smashed chickpeas. These options are not just healthy but also super satisfying.\n2. The Creamy Spread\n \nNo sandwich is complete without a spread to tie everything together. Choose something that adds flavor without piling on empty calories:\nAvocado:\n Creamy, delicious, and full of healthy fats. It’s a great substitute for butter or mayo. Mash it up with a little salt and pepper for a spread you’ll love.\nHummus:\n A fantastic plant-based option that’s rich in protein and fiber. It comes in different flavors, so you can mix things up—roasted red pepper, garlic, or plain.\nGreek Yogurt Spread:\n Mix plain Greek yogurt with herbs and spices for a tangy, creamy spread. It’s lower in fat than mayo and tastes amazing.\n3. The Crunch Factor\n \nYou can’t skip the crunch! It’s the texture that makes every bite exciting. Here are some ideas to keep things interesting:\nLeafy Greens:\n Romaine lettuce, spinach, or arugula adds freshness and a satisfying crunch. Plus, they’re packed with vitamins and antioxidants.\nThinly Sliced Veggies:\n Cucumber, bell peppers, and carrots are perfect for adding crunch and color. Bonus: they’re super hydrating and low in calories.\nPickles:\n For a tangy twist, add pickles or banana peppers. They give your sandwich a zesty kick!\n4. The Cheesy Touch\n \nIf you’re a cheese lover, this is your time to shine. A little cheese goes a long way to add creaminess and flavor:\nSliced Cheddar or Swiss:\n Classic choices that melt beautifully if you’re making a toasted sandwich.\nFeta or Goat Cheese:\n These crumbly cheeses add a tangy, gourmet vibe to your sandwich.\nVegan Cheese:\n There are great plant-based cheese options out there if you’re avoiding dairy.\n5. The Secret Ingredient\n \nEvery sandwich needs that one thing that takes it to the next level. Here are some game-changers:\nPesto:\n Spread a thin layer of pesto for a burst of herby flavor. It’s especially great with chicken or roasted veggies.\nSriracha or Hot Sauce:\n Add a little heat to wake up your taste buds. Just a drizzle will do!\nFruits:\n Yes, fruits! Sliced apples, pears, or even dried cranberries can add a sweet contrast to savory ingredients.\nHow to Build the Perfect Sandwich\n \nNow that you’ve got all these amazing ingredients to choose from, here’s how to put it all together:\nStart with a base: whole-grain bread, a wrap, or even a lettuce leaf for a low-carb option.\nAdd your protein: pick your favorite meat, eggs, or plant-based protein.\nLayer on the veggies: the more color, the better!\nSpread it out: choose a healthy spread like hummus or avocado.\nFinish strong: sprinkle on cheese, nuts, or that secret ingredient to make it truly yours.\nThe Bottom Line\n \nThe best sandwich ingredient is the one that makes you excited to eat your meal! Whether you’re in the mood for creamy avocado, crunchy veggies, or flavorful pesto, there are so many ways to create a healthy, delicious sandwich that’s totally your style.\n \nSo go ahead, get creative, and build a sandwich that’s not just a meal—it’s an experience.

He was better employed earlier but gave up his job after consulting his boss, for the sake of one of his friend who had 7 daughters and 2 sons...totalling 9 kids. Well, if you are from a lower middle class family from India you will get to know the situation at which my father's friend was in. It was impossible for that guy to sustain his family with his earnings. My dad remained unemployed for a short time, as he couldnt get another one. Finally, He took up the job of a driver then eventually joining to one of my father’s senior to the same company. Seeing my father’s condition he offered to help and financed to some extent mine and my brother's educational expenses. I continued studying in the same school, ranked in top 10 schools of the state. Later on I moved to another school which was supposedly less expensive, in my high school. Took up science and wished to pursue MBBS and end the struggle my father did. He wished to see us well educated. Coaching seemed to be expensive so I didnt join any institute and went up with self study. I got a decent rank in NEET but it was not enough to fetch me a seat in a government college. Looked up to previous years results and found out that I had a 50-50 chance. Private medical colleges are a tad too much expensive. I thought of dropping an year but then again I had a short councelling with my father's friend who helped my father financially uptil now. Since completing my studies and starting my career would take atleast 15 years, I thought of dropping the idea altogether. I had a younger brother too, just two years younger to me. HENCE, I DIDNT SIT FOR COUNCELLING. Later on I found out that I could have got a seat in a govt college, but I have no regrets. I appeared for the engineering entrance too, on my fathers suggestion though not completely prepared. Even then I scored decently and was finally admitted to a private engineering college ranked in top 3 in my state. This too seemed unaffordable and hence took an educational loan for the same. Thats where I am now.\n \nHere come's the catch.\n I MADE NO FRIENDS. NOT A SINGLE ONE I CAN COUNT AS MY FRIEND. \n \n I was in my middle school when I was bullied a number of times by the \"richer\" one's of my batchmates. Well that was really awful and remember all those to this day. Really insulting. Later on I changed school and here I kept mum about my father's occupation. Whichever friend I made were kept a little way from my personal life limited to school only. I carried on with my studies but later on I felt It was wrong for my part. There wasn't any excuse to keep mum. But I carried on. With my school days over I dont think I will be able to make friends either. Everyone around me is counted as my competitor. I was relieved to find a few people on my first months in college whom I could count on but everthing went down as it came. We were considered notorious bunch, thanks to a few and hence were redistributed into two sections in the second semester, just 6 months into college. Later on some serious issues crept up and we split into smaller groups. The management succeded.\n \nThe closest ones that fit in th definition as a friend were a bunch of three in my high school, but still I kept them away from my personal life. Almost forgotten by now, as it seems. I didnt make any memories either and seems difficult for me living up later on.\n \nAs of now, was too much depressed by holding up so many things within me, adding the uncertainity of my future as an engineer. \nI dont count myself poor. I got the best opportunities possible, all thanks to my dad and mum\n. All that to be blamed was I, who made a blunder of myself.\n \nRead up somewhere that writing down all your thoughts relieves a bit.\n \nDidn\n’\nt want to draw much attention hence went anonymous.\n \nThank You.", "authorship": "human"}

I can’t remember now but it was probably $2,000 in traveller’s cheques (checks), which is more or less what I always brought with me. He asked how long I was staying, I said “two weeks; the first week in said hotel and second week I’ll probably hit the road and see more of the country”. He asked where in the country I’d go. I said I was thinking of going to southern states but hadn’t set anything in stone yet.\n \nHe turned and motioned to a security guard behind him and to my surprise they led me away. It was pretty embarrassing. I remember everybody in the line behind me gawping like I was some criminal. Just to paint the scene: I’m white, at the time I was in my late 20s, I had a good job, spoke well, dressed nicely, etc. I never got angry, never cussed or raised my voice.\n \nThey sat me down in a big waiting room with 10 or 20 others. I noticed the others waiting along side me could not speak English and were having problems filling in their visas.\n \nA man in a uniform (a cop? I don’t know) with a handgun sat opposite me. He shouted out “what’s your occupation?”. I said “computing”. In front of everybody, including 5–10 other cops, he shouted “oh… I get it… you’re the type to go online on a Friday night and look for women!”. I was so embarrassed! I just quietly said “no”. He then shouted “I know… you look for a date online because you can’t talk to women in person. I know what you’re like. I know the sort of person you are!”. I was so embarrassed about his shouting, that again, I quietly just said “no”.\n \nThen he turned off his computer at the switch instead of shutting it down. He said “Oops. Server problem. What are we going to do? Call tech support? How would you fix it? The computer’s not working. How am I going to process your visa if my computer is broken? You need to fix it!”. I just shrugged. I felt terrible.\n \nHe sat there in silence for a while, then called me over to his desk and wrote some notes. I sat there dry-mouthed and exhausted from my flight and his behaviour. Eventually he looked up and said “ok, you can go”. I stood up to walk away but just couldn’t. I thought there is no way I can enjoy being in this country after this experience.\n \nI desperately looked around for something to say to show I wasn’t going to take all this nonsense. I saw he had a ring on his finger. Out of desperation I said “what’s that ring for?”. He said “I won it in the Super Bowl”. I replied “no you didn’t, you liar. That’s a class ring”. He said “what do you know about football anyway? You guys just kick that stupid little white soccer ball around”. I said “I know more about your football than you do”. He said “yeah? Let’s just see about that”. He hit me with a number of questions about the NFL. I answered everything with ease. He couldn’t believe it! He shouted “oh! Check this guy out! Ask him anything about the NFL!”. All his buddies crowded around the desk and I put my feet up on it LOL. They all fired questions at me and I answered everything perfectly.\n \nThe officer who had insulted me at the start shouted “You can come back any time! We’ll drink some beers, we’ll watch the game…”. Then he shouted at one of his co-workers (who was wearing a suit) “go and get this guy’s bags for him!”. I sat with my feet up on the desk while they ran off to collect my things from the baggage hall. I felt 10 feet tall when the guy brought my suitcase to me on one of those little trucks. At last I could enjoy my holiday! :)\n \nBut that was one bizarre experience!", "authorship": "human"}

Referred to as “that terrorist”.\n \nAsked if my parents make bombs at home or if my parents plan to kill people.\n \nStared down by most, including some teachers especially on September 11th of every year.\n \nOne high school teacher asked me if the country where I am from is where they don't allow women to have orgasm and cut their clitoris and if I was subjected to the mutilation (I am obviously middle Eastern, and he was talking about an African country so No. I was not subjected to any mutilation.) He was actually an open minded teacher and I don't think he was trying to come across as ignorant but he did.\n \nA lot of people don't realize that when you migrate to the United States, 99% of people want a better life. They are usually escaping from something that is destroying the quality of their life. Middle Eastern run from extremists as well as poverty and lack of choices. Mexican are running from poverty, gang violence, and much more. Syrians are running from their OWN government. Everyone wants a better quality of life so they run from a country that no longer allows them to be physically or emotionally comfortable. So accusing them to be terrorists and rapists only makes the situation worse for them and they feel unaccepted in a new country that they were hoping would provide them new opportunities; where they won't feel threatened by the environment around them.\n \nIt's sad. It lets you down. Immigrants are grateful for this nation more than its own natural citizens. We come here and we work HARD. We become entrepreneurs, encourage our children to do better in school because not all of us had the opportunity to go to school, we pay taxes and help this country's economy. No one is more grateful for this nation than the immigrants because we know what this country means to us. We have lived in hell before. If I think United States is paradise, then why would I want anyone to threaten my paradise?\n \nI have met ignorant people through out my life each more ignorant than the other. I also meet people that welcome me and are grateful for my presence as I am for theirs. They understand the struggle my family and I have gone through.\n \nI am proud to say that my parents has built a beautiful life for themselves. We never were offered government assistance and we never asked for it either. I had to get FAFSA for school and it was not a grant it was a loan. We never have lived under welfare. It took us 13 years to finally get a visa to move here. We didn't magically get invited. My family was thoroughly wetted. Inspectors surprise visited our home for an inspection multiple times. Paper work over paperwork and interview over interview. Questions like these were asked: Why did we want to come to the US?, What are our intentions?, How were we going to support ourselves?, Why didn't we want to stay where we were? What did we have to offer the United States?, And hours worth of more questions.\n \nIf we didn't want to better our lives, we would have not gone through the struggle that it took to get here. In no way do I or my family intends to harm the US or it's people. Yet people choose to not understand that. It's easier to say that we are harmful and threatening than to understand that we just want to LIVE.\n \nI guess I experienced more ignorance in school than outside of school because kids aren't afraid to express themselves and what they hear from their parents.", "authorship": "human"}

However, resistance training which is often overlooked is equally needed for the maintenance of a healthy weight. As you age, the body’s bone density and muscle mass deplete. To maintain proper metabolic function, weight training is imperative! Building strong muscles means burning more calories at rest, ultimately resulting in a healthier body weight. For beginners, I recommend at least 2 days of weight training a week along with at least 3 days of cardiovascular exercise. While this may seem like too much time, you can combine the two activities! Moves like jump squats and burpee’s get your heart rate up and your muscles burning!\n \n2. Change up your routine:\n \nFitness does not have to be boring! Keeping fitness fun will not only improve your adherence to exercise, but it is actually proven that changing the FITT (frequency, intensity, time, and type) of your exercise routine will yield better results. For fun workouts ideas check out my Instagram page \n@bodyby.becca.\n \n3. The ’80-20’ rule- Flexibility is Key\n \nThe ‘All or Nothing’ mindset is inherently destructive. You don’t need a 1 hour workout or a perfect day of clean eating for it to “count.” No one is perfect and your healthy routine won’t be either! I use the ’80-20’ rule when discussing healthy lifestyle habits with clients. Meaning, 80% of the time you make consciously healthy decisions (intuitive eating and exercise) while 20% of the time strict adherence is not necessary. Just as one good meal won’t make you healthy, one missed workout wont make you unhealthy! I have found this strategy to be attainable for both myself and clients; in turn, resulting in the greatest rate of long term success. Eat the ice cream once and a while, it won’t kill you. Mental health is just as important as your physical health!\n \n4. Macronutrient Essentials:\n \nNo, you don’t need to count calories or macronutrients, but awareness of what is going into your body is key. In order to look and FEEL your best, the body requires all three macronutrients: carbohydrates, protein and fat. Try to include all three categories every time you sit down for a meal. If you miss one during one meal, make up for it the next! Again, flexibility is key.\n \nExamples of carbohydrates include: vegetables, grains, fruits.\n \nExamples of protein include: chicken, salmon, quinoa, beans.\n \nExamples of fat include: avocado, nuts, olive oil.\n \n*** Note that the caloric value of fats is necessary but DOES add up fast, so I recommend measuring out these foods before consumption.\n \n5. Drink Water:\n \nTip: drink a full glass of water before every meal to help curb your appetite.\n \nThe benefits of water consumption cannot be reiterated enough! Drinking water promotes weight loss by removing the by products of fat from the body. On top of that, it fills your stomach, helping you differentiate between real hunger and thirst, which your body can misinterpret as hunger.\n \n6. Take a well rounded approach to fitness:\n \nThe benefits of eating well and adopting healthy lifestyle habits go far beyond the physical. The mental changes you experience are immeasurable. Of course, the specifics vary depending on the person. From my experience, I have less self doubt and stress, along with more energy, confidence, and happiness since adopting a healthy lifestyle. Unknowingly, these benefits manifest much more quickly than the physical goal and seep into all facets of your life: relationships, work or school, and social life. Being consciously aware of these changes will help you appreciate this amazing journey and the progress you have made so far.", "authorship": "human"}

He motioned his hand into screwing and confirmed that he meant fasteners. I was gob smacked, but I could only come up with: “Sure, do you think that they nailed the bits and pieces when they sent Sputnik into the space, before US?” And, I waited for him to say something that would indicate he was joking. Nope; instead he said: “Well, I have heard that Russians are behind times, you know.” I explained to him that screws are 4000 years old invention and Russians or actually Soviets are not behind in any technology at all because the moment you guys invent something they pay someone who is willing to sell it.\n \nIn 1992 I was in a supermarket with a girlfriend whose disposition was: “I like to buy my own brands”, so I was more an observer as a clever man should do. As I was just standing at the beginning of an aisle, a man looking to be about 60 approached me and blurred: “Hey, what’s your name?” I just said my name and he just grabbed my hand, shook it and said: “Welcome to America! Now you can go to school, learn to read and write, make something of yourself. Isn’t it great to be in a great country? We have electricity and stores and everything!” By this time, my GF had heard the last part and came for an attack. To stop her from getting upset and ruining the night, I just used sign language to tell her to play along: she knew sign language because she was an interpreter. I thanked the guy and mentioned that I hope I can get accepted in a good school. He looked at me and said: “Oh, are you deaf?” I just said: “No, she is! Have a nice night.”\n \nIn 1996 I had a business meeting with a potential client whom could only meet for breakfast. He named a restaurant in a hotel, which was his favorite, and I accepted. Arriving on time, he was already there so I sat down and magically a waiter appeared with our drinks! He told me that he had already placed the orders for our drinks! I started to dread the moment as we were in south and I abhor iced tea or sweet tea as they call it. I was wrong; the waiter placed a short glass (whiskey glass) in front of me and said: “Your vodka, sir.” I looked at my host, a bit puzzled, and he just smiled and said: “You Russians drink vodka, right? I got you some Smirnoff Russian vodka!”. I generally think one should treat others as one expected to be treated, alas, I doubt this was a situation for such care. I decided that the client aspect is not as important to me as being treated like a child and upper handed behavior. I replied: “I am not going to count on us having any business after I say this: I am not Russian, and Russians don’t drink vodka for breakfast in general, you should know that Smirnoff is not made in Russia, but in USA, and I don’t think it is polite to order someone’s drink before you even know them.” He just got up and said: “Well #$^& you too, I was trying to be nice to you, I am not giving you any business!”\n \nTake your pick.\n \nNOTICE: Before any American Quora viewer starts to post ANY messages to tell me how this and that and American hating etc., read the following: There are ignorant in EVERY COUNTRY; god made man in his own image. I am not generalizing/stereotyping Americans to be ignorant.\n \nP.S. Thank you to Antonio Martin for his edit and help. My iPhone 4 is not the best for typing!", "authorship": "human"}

In my defense I’ve suffered from severe mental illness most of my adult life so I can relate to not being able to hand back the correct change. You see when we mentally challenged folks are on medication it makes our thinking like molasses finding clarity through thick mud. It is so hard to think when I am on bad drugs.\n \nSo yes, I’ve held many of these jobs that at bad times in my life render me incapable of them. Please do not blame me. Perhaps blame the fact that besides me being on medication that makes it nearly impossible for me to think but also that machines teach us not to think for ourselves. In pressing in buttons our thinking abilities are rendered inactive thus eventually become muted over time.\n \nTechnology is rendering us low skilled laborers out of the job market. Its scary and frightening for a whole bunch of people like me who do not have access to education or the ability to think on a level demanding a living wage. Us poor people bear the brunt of blame for our inability to rise out of insurmountable odds against us. We attend elementary schools where the Kindergarten children run around slurring hate speech at the others so the chance for us to learn our ABCs does not arrive. Yet our schools push us onto the first grade ill equipped to handle the challenges that face us there because we never got the ingredients of a calm classroom education.\n \nNot only that our parents are in marriages that make our home environment chaotic too. Our parents if both home at the same yell at each other and bicker about money and sex and bargain on how much our father will pay our mother to feed us kids so we can eat that week for how many times she will sleep with him for that money….A little too much information? Perhaps. Keep reading.\n \nThe challenges that face us poor people render us in these positions in life where we are utterly helpless dependent on others because we never learn the tools on how to escape these situations. We get told to have them. But no one ever teaches how to get out of these bad situations even when we do earn the ability for education because others heap other insurmountable odds onto our plates like illness and physical disability rendering us then unable to attend universities like our peers sail through leading them to jobs that you reading this I imagine perhaps have.\n \nIts easy not to see poor people. We are everywhere. We are the checkers at 7-Eleven whose parents did not speak English so we went into Kindergarten not equipped with the language skills our English speaking peers have. It is little wonder when we get passed on through education that our deficiencies don’t measure up to other peers. It is not a fair game we play in life and so when I hear others tell each other how ignorant we can be, I get saddened at the lack of insight that person gives to the checker like me who can’t do simple math. I’ve been a checker. I am a college graduate. I have been a checker after my college graduation. I have been many more things and many less things in my life but ignorant I don’t think is one I am most proud of. So next time we all see a person who can’t do simple math try to think about what that kid’s childhood has been like leading to him or her not being able to count back from $100. It should not insight a superior mentality. It should insight gratitude for the privilege some of us get to attend elementary schools where the kids don’t fight forcing a teacher into behavior management rather than educational inspirer extraordinaire.

This addiction started at the age of 13 when my father bought me my first weight set. I am currently 21 years old. In the 8 years that I have spent training, I've read dozens of books regarding training, read and watched thousands of videos in that time aswell.\nHere an some interesting facts about myself:\n \nI’ve performed over a million push-ups in my life.\nBack to your question about two days a week full body workout. Here's a excerpt from the book \nDinosaur Training: LOST SECRETS OF STRENGTH AND DEVELOPMENT.\nDinosaur training sessions are short, hard and infrequent. A typical session will consist of no more than twenty sets, with at least half of those sets being progressively heavier warm-ups. The average number of sets per workout would be between eight and fifteen. Some sessions will consist of only four or five sets. A typical week will see the dinosaur training only two or three times. That means the dinosaur trains his entire body with well under fifty sets PER WEEK. It also means the dinosaur will spend no more than three hours per week on his training. I refer to this type of training as abbreviated training.\n \nThere are two basic ways to implement abbreviated training. One way is to work the entire body in each workout. For example, you might train on Monday and Thursday. On Monday you would do squats, benches, pulldowns and seated military presses. On Thursday you would do HAMMER STRENGTH leg presses, stiff legged deadlifts, chins, dips and standing curls with a barbell. Thus, you are doing a total body workout every time you train, but you are doing different movements in each session and only working each particular exercise one time per week.\n \nThe second way to implement abbreviated training is to train each basic exercise only one time per week. and do only two or three basic exercises per session. For example, you might do squats and benches on Monday, followed by presses, pulldowns and dips on Wednesday, followed by deadlifts or cleans, shrugs and barrel lifting on Friday.\n \nIn either approach, the sets, reps and exercises are up to the discretion and personal preference of the lifter. Either system allows you to do high rep death marches with a heavy poundage ... to do five sets of five reps ... to do heavy singles ... to do rack work or anything else that strikes your fancy.\n \nIf you prefer to get more rest between training sessions, schedule your program over a ten day or two week period. For example, take two workouts over a ten day period instead of two workouts over a seven day period. Or train three times in two weeks rather than three times in one week. The variations are endless.\nJust to make things easier for you, here's a great schedule:\n \nDAY ONE\n (sets x reps)\n \n1. Squat 4x5\n 2. Standing Press 4x5\n 3. Bent-over Barbell Row 4x5\n 4. Farmer's Walk (one time)\n 5. Bent-legged situps 2x8-15\n 6. Auxiliary work for neck, biceps or calves (optional)\n \nDAY TWO\n \n1. Bent-legged Deadlift, Stiff-legged Deadlift, Power Clean, Power Pull, or Power Snatch 4 x 5 (or 5 x 3 for cleans, pulls or snatches)\n 2. Bench Press (barbell or dumbbell) (or floor press) 4x5\n 3. Sandbag Walk (one time)\n \n4. Side-bends 2x8-15\n 5. Auxiliary work as on Day One (optional)\n \nSounds simple, doesn't it? That's because it IS simple. Hard? Just try it.\n \nPerseverance, patience and determination will be repaid in untold wealth, health, strength, self-reliance and fortitude. \nGeorge F. Jowett", "authorship": "human"}

Forget about just jogging on the treadmill; I’m talking about getting every muscle group ready for action. Think leg swings, arm circles, walking lunges, and hip openers.\n \nThe goal here is to get the blood flowing, the joints lubricated, and the nervous system primed. By the time I’m done with this, I’m in ignition mode - ready to dominate the workout ahead.\nStrength is the foundation. Without it, everything else falls apart. I hit the gym four days a week, focusing on compound movements that target multiple muscle groups. Here’s how I break it down:\nDay 1: Push Day (Chest, Shoulders, Triceps)\nBench presses, overhead presses, dips, and push-ups. I mix up the rep ranges - some days it’s heavy with lower reps, other days it’s lighter with higher reps. This keeps the muscles guessing and growing.\nDay 2: Pull Day (Back, Biceps)\nDeadlifts, pull-ups, rows, and bicep curls. The deadlift is my bread and butter here. It’s a full-body movement that’s as functional as it gets, teaching the body how to move a heavy load safely.\nDay 3: Leg Day (Quads, Hamstrings, Glutes)\nSquats, lunges, leg presses, and Romanian deadlifts. Leg day is sacred. I go hard here because strong legs are the foundation of a strong body. I finish with calf raises because, hey, balance is everything.\nDay 4: Functional Day (Core, Mobility, Full Body)\nKettlebell swings, Turkish get-ups, farmer’s walks, and core work. This is the day where I mix it up. The goal is to build functional strength - strength that translates to real-life activities. I focus on stability, coordination, and mobility, making sure my body is not just strong but also agile.\nI’m not about that endless treadmill grind, but cardio has its place. After my strength work, I like to finish with high-intensity interval training (HIIT). It could be sprints, battle ropes, or a quick circuit of burpees, box jumps, and mountain climbers.\n \nThe idea is to get the heart rate up, torch some calories, and build endurance. This usually lasts 15-20 minutes, but it’s enough to leave me drenched in sweat and feeling like a warrior.\n \nEvery session ends with a solid 10-15 minutes of stretching and mobility work. I focus on the areas I hit that day, making sure everything stays loose and limber. This is crucial for recovery, injury prevention, and keeping the body moving smoothly. I throw in some yoga-inspired moves because flexibility is just as important as strength.\n \nRest days are just as important as workout days. I take two full days off each week to let my body recover. This is when the magic happens - muscles repair, grow, and get stronger.\n \nI stay active with light activities like walking or swimming, but nothing too intense. I also make sure to get plenty of sleep and fuel my body with the nutrition - testosterone booster, healthy fats, and carbs to keep my energy levels high.\n \nMy gym routine is a living thing. It evolves as I do. If something isn’t working or if I hit a plateau, I switch it up. I’m always learning, always pushing the boundaries of what my body can do. The gym isn’t just a place to work out; it’s a place to challenge myself, to grow, and to become the best version of me.\n \nSo, that’s my routine - a mix of strength, functionality, and a mindset that’s always hungry for more. It’s not just about building muscle; it’s about building a body that’s ready for anything. And trust me, when you approach the gym with this mindset, the results go way beyond the mirror.", "authorship": "human"}

But you are on the internet, you are therefore un-poor enough to be wasting your time doing nothing.\n \nPeople always talk about India, Africa, South America etc when they talk about being poor.\n \nDo you realise that in Italy a few years ago they changed the law to say that stealing food is not a crime and shouldn’t be punished if you are doing it because you are hungry - why? Because people were doing it.\n \nI am from England. I was in foster care from the age of 10, growing up I met people who slept in the same bed as 4–6 siblings, people who would go out and have to wash cars or do paper rounds so that they could feed themselves. People who, at the age of 13 were sent to prison for theft, burglary or dealing drugs because they required money as they had no other means of getting it. That isn’t mentioning the fact there are families who \nhave \nto take their older siblings hand-me-down clothes. Not because they are smaller but because there is no money to pay for anything else.\n \nBeing poor is completely relative to the situation and place you live in, if you live in London, you cannot live a measly wage, you live in certain parts of the West Midlands, Wales and many other places - you can eat very well buying shopping £20 per week (this is pocket money after having paid bills).\n \nThe UK is one of the most expensive countries in which to live, because of the fact that we have an awful lot of greedy rich people, we are a small ass island, our currency being worth the most in the world market also means that the business owners are stingy with it. People used to get paid for their skills, nowadays because there are so many people out there looking for jobs, practically every job pays minimum wage. Unless you live in a bedsit - one room with bedroom, kitchen (sometimes shared), bathroom (most of the time shared with two other people) - you cannot live on your own. Basic rent for a house/ flat in my city which is not poor but not great either is around £550 per month, then you have 80-£120 council tax, £30 water, £30 gas, £30 electric (these are estimates). This before you are talking about food, travel expenses, clothing, having children, phones etc.\n \nContrary to popular belief, most people in the so called first world countries are not rich or do not have more money, yes we might have more than others, however most of it is on credit. This means that most people don’t actually own anything that is theirs - \nthey may owe thousands for university (and will be paying it for the rest of their lives)\n they owe thousands for their car\n credit cards (a lot of people require this because they cannot pay everything out then survive until the end of the month), they don’t own their homes, the banks do, they are paying the banks back little by little, the average household takes about 50 years for two people to pay it off. \nphone contracts - on credit\n \n*Edit: 1 bedroom flats in my city start at £650 (cheap) a single person on the most common wage of minimum wage will only earn about £1020 after tax.", "authorship": "human"}

I was really excited to meet and interact (rampage) with other people from all over the world. So I got to it right away.\n \nAfter a while, I had already formed a 'crew' in the game. We had 4 Americans, an Indian and a coincidentally, a fellow Nigerian. We had a lot of fun there, driving around and chatting away. Then one day, some other American came in to talk to us. Upon reading my name tag (which also displayed the country the player is from), the first thing he said was,\n \n“You're from Nigeria?”\n \n“Yes”\n \n“That's impossible, Nigeria has no internet”.\n \nI was dumbfounded. Apparently, this guy thought I was lying in the middle of the desert in “Africa”, taking a well deserved break from herding the cattle, fighting Lions and what not; saying enchantments that would enable me to use the “white man's web” to connect with these other people to control my character on the magic screen in front of me. Me and my new friends tried to convince him that Nigeria, and pretty much the rest of the world did infact have internet but he still stood his ground. It turned out that this guy was a complete jackass. Soon he deemed it necessary to use the “N” word in every sentence he made knowing full well there were two blacks talking with him. Lucky for him I didn't feel particularly offended by the word at the time. He also made jokes about how dark I am, even though I am actually lightskinned. This guy went on to insult the Indian too, calling him “terrorist” and other bad \nnames\n. As if being from an Asian country that isn't China or Vietnam= Terrorist! And he actually expected the other Americans to side with him, even asking them what they were possibly doing, mingling with us 'inferiors'. Fortunately, the other people, being more sensible than him, refused and called him out on his bullshit.\n \nHe then went on to insult our countries, called us 'poor', ' hungry' and even dared me to go outside and tell a policeman I didn't believe in Allah to prove how 'free' my country was ( disregarding the fact I live in the southern and predominantly Christian part of the country). This was around the time a Nigerian man hijacked a plane in the US so for a while, Nigeria was considered an “anti-US” country.\n \nThis went on for a while, so we had no choice but to murder the jerk and move on (video game, remember). This brief encounter led me to believe that all Americans were rude, ignorant Jacka**es and this stuck with me for a while. Although now I know that not all Americans are dumb. But the sad truth is that there are still a LOT of ignoramuses, perhaps even more than the smart ones, and this means people are more likely to meet an ignorant American. But the truth is EVERY country has dumb people, and singling out one country to pick on it is wrong. Maybe it's because USA is the current top dog. So everyone expects them to know everything about the rest of the world, like a father would.\n \nAlso I see a lot of people saying things like\n \n“Americans aren't dumb, we have GEDs!!”\n \nWell, that is as relevant as saying a tiger isn't aggressive because you saw it climb a tree.\n \n“Dumb” in this context refers to “uninformed”, not “uneducated”.", "authorship": "human"}

A certain degree of soreness in the muscles is inevitable when we move in ways that we’re not used to, but it shouldn’t be crippling (that means you’ve overdone it). But any other kind of pain, especially in your joints, or any of the other things I mentioned, are red flags\nThat said, here are some more specific suggestions.\nMake sure your routine has a strength component. Do this 2–3 times a week, on non-consecutive days.\nMake sure your routine has an endurance component. Do this 3–5 times a week.\nMake sure you keep your joints mobile. Do this almost everyday; think of it like ‘brushing your teeth’, but for your joints.\nSTRENGTH\n \nFor each of the categories below, pick an exercise which is moderately challenging (not too hard and not too easy). Accumulate 15 - 30 total repetitions per session for each category. Split them up any way you like. If you feel like the exercise in a particular category goes from ‘moderately challenging’ to ‘easy’, pick a harder version of the exercise, go back down to the lower end of that repetition range, and build your way up to the higher end. Then rinse and repeat. Be patient and do this over months, not days. That’s how you stay safe. Sometimes, to make an exercise harder, you’ll need to add more weight. Be creative and use household objects.\nPushing (push up variations)\nPulling (dead hang, pull up variations, rowing variations)\nSquatting (squat/lunge etc)\nENDURANCE\n \nPick an activity you enjoy (e.g. walking/hiking/running/swimming/cycling/dancing etc) - it doesn’t matter what you pick. You can switch it up session to session, or not, as you like - it doesn’t matter. Do it steadily for 20–30 minutes. Do it at a difficulty level where you can speak 5–6 words at a time before needing to take a breath (but if you can speak 15–20 words, you need to step it up).\n \nOnce you’re used to the activity, increase the duration of one session a week to 45 minutes, while the other sessions remain 20–30 minutes. Eventually increase the long session close to 60 minutes.\n \nJOINT MOBILITY\n \nLook at every joint in your body - neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, spine, hips, knees and ankles. Each of them can move in certain ways. Some joints, such as the neck, spine, hips, and shoulders, can move more freely than the others. Throughout the day, take little breaks of a minute or two, and keep moving the joints in all the ways they CAN move. Keep it super easy, but do it a bunch of times. Don’t sweat if you can’t move EVERY joint EVERY day, just make sure no joint gets ignored for too long. Easy-peasy.\n \nHope you find this helpful. It looks simple, but the power is in DOING, not in KNOWING. If you’re a beginner and you keep this up for a few months, your health, energy, and overall sense of well-being are bound to improve.

But it’s not nothing, either, and it’s reasonable to expect a noticeable improvement in strength within that timeframe assuming you know what you are doing.\n \nTo improve your strength, you need to stimulate the muscle fibers associated with strength (duh). These are known as “fast-twitch” muscle fibers. These fibers produce a lot of force quickly, as opposed to “slow-twitch” fibers which are more efficient, but produce less force. This means that in order to build strength, \nyou’ll want to lift heavier weights for shorter durations\n, rather than lighter weights for longer durations.\n \nNow, there are many different (often conflicting) schools of thought on how to optimally stimulate the body so as to build strength, so I don’t want to offer anything as the be-all, end-all of strength building, but \nhere’s a general structure that should at least get you started\n:\n \n-Compound exercises (exercises that involve more than one joint such as leg press, chest press, compound row, etc.) will be the most effective and efficient exercises. You can do isolation exercises as well (like bicep curls, etc.), but I would suggest you start your workouts with the compounds for optimal results.\n \n-For a given exercise, find a weight that will completely fatigue your muscles in about 1–2 minutes. Anything you cannot do for at least a minute is probably too heavy, and anything over two minutes is probably too light to stimulate the best results (as far as strength is concerned).\n \n-Try not to let your muscles relax for the entire duration of each exercise. So for example, if you’re using a leg press machine, don’t lock your legs out, and don’t rest the weights at the bottom. Keep moving and keep the muscles working the whole time. (This is important! Resting during an exercise allows your slow-twitch (endurance) muscle fibers a chance to recover, limiting engagement from fast-twitch (strength) fibers and therefore limiting your improvements in strength.)\n \n-Perform as many repetitions as you can, \nslowly\n*,\n until you can no longer \nsafely\n** \ncontinue (ie. muscle failure).\n \n*Emphasis on moving \nslowly\n because moving quickly means you are using momentum to carry the weight up/forward, and using gravity to assist on the way back. \nGo slowly and embrace the burn.\n \n**Emphasis on \nsafely\n because people tend to sacrifice form after getting carried away with thinking that the goal of exercising is to do as many repetitions as possible. It’s not. The goal of exercise is to stimulate a response in the body. \nKeep good form\n, challenge yourself, and when you can no longer move the weight with good form, stop and slowly set the weight down.\n \n-One \ngood\n set (ie., total muscle failure) per exercise \nshould\n be sufficient. This might be a controversial take, but this is how I exercise, and it saves me a lot of pain and time, and limiting myself to one set doesn’t seem to effect my results (as far as strength is concerned). Your results may vary, however, especially early on when you’re learning to push yourself, so if you want to do multiple sets, knock yourself out.\n \nTL;DR\n: Lift and lower the weights slowly, with good form, without resting, until your muscles become completely fatigued and you can no longer complete your final repetition, which ideally would occur between 1–2 minutes.\n \nI hope this helps; good luck!", "authorship": "human"}

I am being very polite, which I suggest as a basic approach when you don’t understand what you are seeing. I get done listening to the Choir practice (Practices are open for free listening, or they were then, and it was GREAT).\n \nI decide to go look at this other building with dioramas in it. I figure out they are based on Scenes From Scripture, and I can identify the Old and New Testament scenes, but I’m quite lost on the ones from the Book of Mormon.\n \nI am stopped in front of a scene. A man is sitting in a chair, at a desk, with a flip-a-page desk calendar on it, model about 1930 to 1970, sheets mounted on central U brads, but made of something like a brassy version of tinfoil rather than paper. He is dressed as a Mayan, and there are cubbyholes built into a wall behind him, filled with clay tablets covered in cuneiform writing. There are patterns like Mayan glyphs painted on the wall to mark the cubbyholes. This looks to me like a complete archaeological mash-up.\n \nAt this point, one of the local insiders walks up with a friend, gestures to the scene, and proclaims, “See? This proves everything in (Scripture) is true!”\n \nShe means that the written scripture, first published in English in the 1800s, is proved scientifically verifiable by a diorama constructed in the late 1900s. Now, if she were talking about something I know about, and expect has a historical basis, say the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, it wouldn’t be proved to have happened because somebody put together a museum exhibit about it after the fact.

It seems that if Americans know that you live on an island, they think you party all the time and are always in swimsuits; sipping pina colada with flowers in your hair. Yeah right…\n \nAnother time I wrote a long comment on a post. I wrote that English is not my native language so my English might not be that clear and that I had grammar and spelling issues.

But my workout right now already helps with a lot of those.\n \nSo, really, I just focus on working up a good sweat. \n \nTime\n. I just go in the morning now. No excuses. I don't do ridiculous 6am video conferences or calls anymore (some of the folks I work with are in Singapore, Russia, Bangalore, etc.) \n \nCut Friction\n. Within 10 minutes of waking up I'm in my gym clothes. I keep my key, headphones, water bottle and iPad near the front door so I take them all as I head out to the gym. Same thing if you run or walk to workout.\n \nI think the reason so few folks swim or bike for exercise anymore is because of the friction. You have to wear special apparel, shower after and wash out the chlorine (another reason why saltwater pools are much better), and then soak your bathing suit, swim cap, googles in water to get the chlorine out, etc.\n \nUnless you work from home, try having two gyms you like - one near work and another near home. In each case, pick the gyms closest to you that you will actually work out in. \n \nI had a home elliptical and a gym 10 feet from my doorstep. I didn't use either much. Now I work out daily because I like my gym and figured out a routine.\n \nWhen I worked in New York, I had two gyms - a free one a work and an Equinox across the street from my home for which I had a work discount. I used both a lot. At one point, the trainer at the work gym said \"Terrence, you don't need to come every day.\" I worked out a lot sometimes. I joined the Reebok gym briefly but it was too far. So even though it was even nicer than Equinox, I worked out more at Equinox.\n \nThe Workout\n. Here's what works for me. I do the 15% max incline on the treadmill in our building's gym. I listen to music, use my iPad and have a water bottle. I do between 20 min to 4 hours of cardio a day, depending. Average is probably 80 minutes. \n \nWhy do I do a 15% incline? Because it is less strain on my knees and back to walk uphill than to run at 0-2% incline. And I can do stuff on my iPad while I'm walking.\n \nAlmost anyone can do this workout. It is super easy. And you can make it hard. Just walk much faster and longer and you'll get a pretty good workout after awhile.\n \nI keep track of my heart rate so its between fat burn and a good burn but not dangerous. Then I try to stretch or lift weights. High reps, low weight. I'm trying to avoid injury so easing into weights. Once I build this into a habit, I will switch it up a bit and do stationary bike, stair climbing, rowing, etc. \n \nRest. \nI take Saturdays off. Mostly because I get up at 5.30am every Saturday to hop on a plane. So I'm already a bit exhausted on most Saturdays. But also partly to stay sane and reward myself.

I knew she was something of a cranky, ignorant redneck and my children asked me why I would bother to correspond with her? Because she is like a LOT of people out there, and I wanted to try to see and understand the world through lenses which were different than those I usually use (my own).\n \nOh, she was interesting, all right .. if ever some subject came up about politicians, she'd go on a several page rant about them, calling them every name in the book. I'm not sure she knew the meaning of the term \"moderation\"; at least, she almost never used it. And ignorant? When my Mom was in her mid-80's, she had a series of small strokes and Granny implied it was my fault for not feeding her all sorts of energy foods that you usually see in those scam ads. As it was, my Mom lived to 89; the average lifespan for women in the US is 82.1, so she certainly wasn't taken from us prematurely.\n \nThis went on for some years .. sometimes I'd tiptoe around her, sometimes, I'd invite a response and would never be disappointed. This carried on until she sent a note and copied several people, whereupon I and one other man on that list had the gall, the temerity, to respond with some of our own comments to the group she identified. Here is the first line of her reply: \"\nI do not remembe giving either one of you male atheist permission to rape the addresses of my livery\n\" [sic]. Then she went on to say how she wished she could castrate me, plus a series of other equally vicious comments. And how is it that I still have that quote? Because her response was so incredible, I copied her letter into my diary file, before I deleted all her email and her address. I haven’t heard from her since (18 months and counting), don’t expect to, but wouldn’t respond to her anyway.\n \nGranny was a cranky, unhappy old woman who have obviously burned enough people in her life that she complained about not having many friends.

After a few months of not being consistent with exercise, I was tired of making excuses. I decided to run first thing every morning before work.\n \nI asked myself three questions:\nWhy do I want to do this?\n Running is my favorite thing to do. The rush I get after a run helps me get through my day. The days when I wouldn't run I felt off mentally. I want to share that it is possible and inspire people to find a fitness habit that they love to do every day too.\nHow do I know I can do this?\n I had already been running for a long time. I have a base level of fitness. Covid-19 let me focus more on running and working remotely gave me more time. All I needed to do was balance harder runs with mostly easy recovery runs each week.\nWhat is my minimum?\n One mile a day. Even if I'm traveling or off the routine, I know I can fit one mile in. Make it easy.\nTips that worked for me:\nBuild a foundation \nof easy running over months or years before you start a run streak and keep easy days easy!\nThe first 100 days are the challenge\n.

In fact training in a “fasted state” (that means with no food eaten for at least 12 hours or more) is probably the \nmost beneficial for weight loss.\n \nThe body has finite storage capacity and will \nnever use fat while you still have stored glucose energy (glycogen for those that love the science)\n \nIt just would not do that.\n \nIf you are trying to \nbuild muscle while staying lean \nthen you need to keep a close eye on protein. \nHigh protein is pointless \n(unless your are selling protein shakes and bars!) The body can not store excess protein. Again it’s the body having finite storage capacity. Anything over roughly 2 chicken legs worth of protein per meal is simply going be turned to glucose or even worse; fat. \nSo moderate protein intake is required. THERE IS NO BEST TIME TO EAT ONLY BEST TIME TO NOT EAT! \nLeaving at least an hour before and after is best.\n \nSidebar: everyone has heard of human growth hormone, it’s the bodys ‘repair and rebuild’ hormone. When you wake up HGH is high, and lowers when you start eating. If you buzz to the gym and take some water with a pinch of pink Himalayan salt with you then you can workout with the elevated human growth hormone still circulating. The salted water is the best for rehydration.\n \nHydration is often thought of as loss of water, it’s actually loss of electrolytes that’s the issue. Hence the pink salt.\n \nLastly some think water increases metabolic rate. It does, temporarily. But this is only because the body works to bring the temperature of the cold water up to body temperature. If you really want to be geeky about training \nnever drink cold water unless it is to bring your temperature down. It’s a 3% lose of workout energy while it raise the water temperature up.\n \nIt’s really minimal though.\n \nBut to answer your question in a more basic way\n \nThe best time to go is when suits you best. All that above might scientifically help but if you FEEL better at night then you’ll probably get more out of it then dragging yourself there reluctantly in the morning.\n \nIf you don’t mind either then you need to focus on what your goal is.

We are living in a lazy society, so I understand when people disagree. Sitting on computer 8–10 hours a day is somehow okay, but working out everyday is apparently not, while the former is more taxing on your body. Where does this consensus come from? Simple, economy. Working out more than 3-4 times a week doesn't contribute to the economy. You can't draw more people to go to the gym, buy apparel or supplements if you promote daily exercise. You don't spend more money working out than hanging out elsewhere. So you will not only be told that you can achieve your dream body just working 2-3 hours a week, but also that your body cannot handle much more. Besides, gym time is still considered a waste, “why” they will tell you, “waste 6-7 days a week at the gym when you could exercise less and enjoy life more?“ Browsing on social media 3 hours a day is considered more normal. It has nothing to do with sports science, it is ideology.\n \nTell me which one is more taxing on the body: Lifting weights where you spend more than 2/3 of your time resting, or an NBA game? Athletes play up to 4 games a week, plus training, you think you cannot handle doing flys, curls, pulldowns, and basic human movements everyday? In all other sports, lifting weights is the supplement to the main sport, and the average gym goer believes s/he has to have full 3-4 rest days a week to maximize benefits and train hard, how pathetic is that? I know those other guys are athletes, it's their job, etc. But we are talking about the capacities of the human body. You can improve your work load capacity. I'm not saying that everyone can or should be an athlete, but an hour of training a day is nowhere close to an athlete's schedule. Athletes typically have up to 15 sessions a week, each around 2.5 hours. Ask olympic weightlifters and they will tell you. Even some bodybuilders, like Jay Cutler, have been known to train twice a day. One of the most respected academicians in sports science, Mike Israetel, also says you can train more than 7 times a week if you have the time and proper schedule that allows for it. Several months ago, he had three sessions a day himself. “Recovery,” in other words, can be handled pretty well.\n \nAnd now people will pull the “natural” card. It is actually the natural lifters who should train as often as possible to increase protein synthesis. You could get away with training each bodypart once a week if you were on steroids, but that's not the case if you are natural. Keep the sessions short and intense, stimulate your muscles and don't annihilate your joints, so you can train the same muscle group as often as possible. That will give you enough weekly volume to grow.\n \nAnd certain muscle groups can be trained almost everyday. Posture muscles (abs, traps), smaller muscles that won't tax your entire body and do not get heavily involved in big compounds (side/rear delts, calves, biceps) can be trained almost everyday. Bigger muscles can be trained 2-4 times a week. If you schedule smartly, it is perfectly fine.\n \nHere\n is a good example by Christian Thibaudeau.

Everybody turned to look at her since not only did we see footage of the wall being torn down, our teacher passed around a fragment of the wall she collected.\n \nAnother instance with this classmate was when she found out I was from Mexico. She asked me if I spoke Mexican and if it was hard to adjust to riding in a car instead of a donkey cart. I thought at first she was being extremely rude but apparently she thought all of México was like Hollywood depicts it in Western movies.\n \nThis is about another person in my high school:\n \nI was at my desk reading since I had gotten to class early and was still waiting for the teacher to arrive. A group of boys entered and were conversing loudly amongst themselves. The topic they were discussing was their experiences dealing with the foreign exchange students they were hosting. One in particular was boasting how the English students had never tried Mexican cuisine before so in order to introduce them, they took them to Taco Bell…. At hearing this I started cursing under my breath in Spanish which brought my presence to their attention.\n \n“Oh, you're like Mexican right? Do you have any good hard shell taco brands you can recommend? My mom wants to cook them a taco casserole.”\n \nI blinked slowly and counted in my head.\n \n“Hard taco shells are not considered Mexican, they are Tex Mex and no it is not the same thing. Buy white corn tortillas if you want to expose them to Mexican food”\n \nI brought them the next day a jar of my mom’s salsa. They told me it was too spicy for them but that it was good.\n \nUpdate:\n \nI forgot one more story possibly because it was so embarrassing I tried to block it.\n \nI took a swimming class in high school instead of taking regular PE. I grew up taking swimming lessons year round so changing in the locker room without a towel wrapped around me for modesty never occurred to me to do since we were all girls there. As I was pulling my swimsuit over my chest I felt hands grasp my arms and was twisted to face a classmate. She kept staring at my chest, freaking me out. She starts yelling “OMG your nipples are brown!!! I didn't know there were brown nipples! Why aren't your nipples pink? Did you burn them?”\n \nThis of course brought forth other white girls who wanted to continue to ogle in amazement in nipples of another color.\n \nYou would've thought that after that I would have changed with a towel wrapped around me but I only had 15 min to dry myself, change and run to the other side of the building for my next class and keeping the towel around you while you try to shimmy with wet legs into skinny jeans is too much of a hassle. By the third day I wasn't (or rather my areolas) a novelty anymore and was able to change in peace.", "authorship": "human"}

You can hit the serape sling patterns of movement with more ease this way too.\nThis allows them to move more freely as well, which allows the arm (the shoulder joint in particular) to move more naturally through rotation (barbells are fixed and tend to beat up on the shoulders/elbows/wrists more)\nThey arguably provide more exercise selection than barbells as you can asymmetrically load every lift you could do with a barbell to create a new challenge.\nThey are easier on the shoulders particularly lifting overhead with a neutral style grip (when compared to the barbell military or overhead press). They allow you to get into neutral grips more easily (which also tend to be nicer on the shoulders).\nThey allow you to train rotational patterns with greater ease (there are landmine exercises you can do with a barbell that are rotational, and you can off-set the loads of barbell to make them more rotationally demanding though)\nBodyweight on it's own often isn't enough because it's a fixed load, once you've adapted to the load you can only do more repetitions (i.e. you can increase endurance but not really strength at that point). Dumbbells will allow you to train closed and open chain movements too.\nDumbbells often let you train with a more natural arc/position\nCons:\n \nBarbells let you lift more (which is more important for lower rep, higher intensity lifting) - especially for the major bilateral lifts (you will generally always be able to bench press, squat and deadlift more with a barbell than dumbbells)\nBarbells are less grip intensive. Dumbbells require more grip strength (which isn't necessarily a bad thing - it just creates a limiting factor if you want to train strength/power more completely)\nBarbells generally allow for better mechanical loading changes with lower body training. i.e. the difference between a back squat (try putting some DB's on your shoulders to see what I mean), a front squat, an overhead squat, and a zercher squat all lead to good training outcomes when used with some variety.\nBarbells allow you to alter grip positions differently by leveraging torque (narrow grip bench vs medium grip or wide grip - can yield different training results you won't be able to get with dumbbells).\nKettlebells provide a better grip challenge than dumbbells and are more suited for exercises like the swing\nKettlebells provide a higher proprioceptive stimulus, particularly for explosive lifts\nBands provide a unique stimulus that is generally hardest where people are their strongest (Dumbbells like Barbells are a more fixed weight relative to the human strength curve)\nSleds allow you to more adequately train concentric only patterns, which can be great for not making you too sore between more dynamic lift days and still getting a training effect.\nI could probably go on. At the end of the day I think having access to a variety of stimulus is ideal, however, you can still get a lot done with dumbbells and bodyweight if that's your only existing option.", "authorship": "human"}

Once the muscle fibers are repaired they increase in size\n \nThis is muscle hypertrophy.\n \nHow does it work?\n \nMuscle growth occurs whenever the rate of muscle protein synthesis(MPS) is greater than the rate of muscle protein breakdown. Both, the synthesis and breakdown of proteins are controlled by complimentary cellular mechanisms. Resistance exercise can profoundly stimulate muscle cell hypertrophy and the resultant gain in strength. However, the time course for this hypertrophy is relatively slow, generally taking several weeks or months to be apparent\n[1]\n \nIt is generally agreed that resistance exercise results in increased MPS in the postexercise recovery period . Indeed, an acute bout of resistance exercise can increase the rate of MPS about two- to fivefold after exercise, and this effect can persist for up to 48 h in fed subjects \n[2]\n \nSo given we can only be in one state at a time, muscle building will only start once you are done working out and you are in your recovery phase.\n \nMuscle building does not mean just taking a day off from the gym.\n \nYou also need to pay special attention to these for hypertrophy\nCaloric surplus diet with sufficient protein\nAdequate sleep\nManage stress levels\nFootnotes\n[1] \nHow Do Muscles Grow?\n[2] \nJournal of Applied Physiology", "authorship": "human"}

He’d always say that “britain used to be ruling over so many colonies and now look” or “if britain ever had the chance i bet they would try and rule the world but fail. However, if america wanted to rule the world they could.” Like, excuse me, i wanted to ask how your days was or hang out and have a friendly chat but no. Your bringing up past wars and trashing other countries such as germany, asian countries, the whole lot. I remember he would always say nasty things towards the french saying that they “suck so bad” and that “britain must suck more because they lost to france”. I heard the ‘brits are coming’ repeatedly.

I told him to stop, i didn’t like what he was saying one bit. He told me to calm down and that he was only ‘joking’. Im sorry, but everything that came out of his mouth was not funny at all.

HELLO\n \nI had to patiently and diplomatically explain to them both that we were from Canada, the big *country* north of the US, while picking my jaw up off the ground at their stunning ignorance. Do US public schools not teach even a bare-bones-level of geography? How can any American NOT KNOW the countries immediately north and south of its borders, or even that there’s a country called Canada??\n \nOne more example of an ignorant American is really reflective of her *parents*, not her, because it was a minor child. My college bordered a busy residential side street that led to a student parking lot in the back and one day one my way to class, driving down the side street an 8–10-week-old puppy ran out from the driveway of a house toward my car. Being an animal-lover I pulled right over, jumped out, grabbed the puppy off the road, and carried her up the driveway where some children were playing. I returned their puppy and asked why they let her run loose into traffic. The oldest child, about 8 or 9 years old, said, “My mama says if that puppy don’t know enough to stay off the road it deserves to get hit.”\n \nInwardly I felt horrified at hearing such an ignorant, heartless thing, especially from a child. But instead of scolding the little girl who, judging from her house and neighborhood, was from a low-income, likely under-educated family, I crouched down and petted her puppy and said, “Do you remember when you were just a wee baby? Remember how when we were really little we didn’t know very much and had to have lots of time to learn stuff?” She nodded. “Well,” I continued, “your puppy is just a baby dog and she doesn’t know anything yet, either. She’s relying on you to teach her to stay off the road so she doesn’t get run over. Just like your mama probably taught you not to run into the road, right?”\n \nShe nodded again, yes. I told her she had a precious life in her hands, that her puppy also needed to be taught, and protected, like her mama had taught her, and if she took care that her puppy never ran into the road again that puppy would live and be her best friend. She smiled and I said goodbye and headed to class.\n \nI think and hope my message got through to that young girl and her siblings, and their ignorance wasn’t their fault—it was clear her mama either didn’t grasp, or care, that puppies need to be trained and confined to their own properties, and they deserve to be properly cared for and protected. That experience gave me a glimpse (one of many, especially in the US South) of generational ignorance that’s passed on between parents and children.", "authorship": "human"}

Everyone in our grade breathed a sigh of relief at the prospect of not having to deal with him anymore. I’m not going to go into detail about what he did in class, but let’s just say my Mythology teacher let loose a scream of frustration because of him and caused all the teachers in the hall to check up on her on one instance.\n \nLet’s call him Thomas.\n \nAnyways, in my freshman year of high school, we ended up going to the same school, but fortunately, I only had one class with him, and that was French. Now, I take my language classes very seriously. \nVery \nseriously. And so with Thomas disrupting the class with inane comments about \neverything\n, (and some of them being extremely sexist and flippant about genders and whatnot) I was ready to pull my hair out. I’m pretty sure the entire class was too, along with our poor teacher. But that’s not the point of this.\n \nOne day, the teacher pulled up Google maps to show us where the small country of Andorra is. As she was dragging the map to it, Thomas let out a dramatic gasp.\n \nBy then, the class as a whole had already silently decided that we would all ignore him and his unwanted commentary.\n \nHowever, what came out of Thomas’ mouth just made all of us simultaneously turn our heads to him to stare in disbelief.\n \n“That’s where Italy is? I thought it was in China!”\n \nThe entire class just stared at him with mouths gaping open like fish. Meanwhile, he was sitting in his desk looking genuinely confused about that. After a few seconds of silence and the realization that he actually didn’t know that Italy was indeed, \nnot\n in China, the teacher cautiously pointed to the smart board/Promethean thingy and said,\n \n“Well, there’s Italy. And here’s Andorra. And make a side note that China does not contain Italy, because otherwise, the Roman Empire would have also been in China, and that just doesn’t make any damn sense.”\n \nSeeing as this was Thomas though, he still insisted that Italy was in China. I suppose by that point in the year, the teacher was absolutely done with him, and so invited him up to the board and told him to find Italy in China.\n \nI found this deeply amusing and had the hardest time keeping my mouth shut. I saw others struggling to keep their laughter in as well, which really wasn’t a surprise, considering we were all about to see Thomas futilely try and find Italy in China on a map.\n \nNone of us ever let him live that down.", "authorship": "human"}

You are also less likely to fall and hurt yourself.\n \nThe two main muscle groups used daily are the lower body and the upper body pulling action. The third group is the upper body pushing action. Very seldom used but you can also do the workout if you want to.\n \nForget all the various types of workouts you can do. Just stick to the simplest that you can groove in and do in your sleep.\n \nThe body weight squat is sufficient for the lower body strength. There is also the need to increase stair climbing ability and endurance. A low stool is a good point to start. Then onto a sturdy chair as you improve. Do this in conjunction with the body squat. It prepares the body when you switch from walking and then climbing stairs.\n \nLower back extensions will cover the upper body pulling action. The most basic is bending forward while trying to touch the toes and then straightening up. It sounds simple but it is NOT. The SPINE must be kept in the neutral position ALL the time. It forces the lower back muscles to do most of the work and thus you will get the proper adaptation. A more advanced and more strength adaptation workout is in the image below.\nPull ups will build arm and related muscles.\n \nPush ups are enough for the pushing group of muscles.\n \nThe agility, balance and cardiovascular part is taken care of by doing rope skipping or rope jumping, whatever the term. For the average person, it is equivalent to running for the same length of time in terms of energy usage if you are looking at weight loss as well.\n \nThe only problem you will face is that it is NOT easy at first. If you target say 30 minutes, I doubt you can even do the two leg version for 10 minutes. Your legs will start to burn. That is the alert to stop. Just do the one leg after the other version at slow speed. Stop and rest when you are alerted. Then continue until you reach the 30 minutes. As you improve, increase speed and slowly build up until you can do the two leg version continously for your target duration. Rope skipping, especially on two legs involve the toes, the ankles and calves mainly. The thigh muscle do only a bit of work. Hardly any stress on the knees as the angle of bend is small. So no fear of knee injury.\n \nNot much more to add except to point out a few things. The rope skipping will most probably bring you up to around 80% of max. This is because you are working at just below the leg burning stage. That level is enough for a fairly high level of cardiovascular adaptation if done for a long enough duration and period. How you schedule your workouts and whether to mix them together in a single session, I leave to you.", "authorship": "human"}

The most ignorant people in America are those holding staunch opinions without being able to articulate the other side’s argument realistically. If they can’t articulate the argument realistically and sincerely, it shows that person has never opened their mind enough to consider why others hold an opposing view - that is the hallmark of ignorance.\n \nCase in point. The majority of Trump supporters were labeled as “racist, mysogynist, homophobes”. Why else would they support Trump as a candidate?\n \nRacist - Many on the left would posit that Trump supporters want a wall, or tighter border security because “we hate Mexicans or other foriegners”. Not true.\n \n1. The majority of those on the right advocating tighter border security are considering the impact of more people requiring more services when we have finite resources to address these problems at current population levels already.\n \n2. Many on the Right have watched the impact of unrestricted migration into European countries and believe that careful screening of those seeking entry is simply prudent.\n \nCaution and prudence are not racist. Let’s face it, you would not let your daughter spend the night at a stranger’s home until you’ve at least had the chance to speak with the parent. Is that because you are hateful, or is that because you are prudent?\n \nMisogynism - Did Trump say horrible things about women? Certainly. Did Hillary defend a child rapist? Certainly. However, based on what we believe to be the best person to address economic issues, issues of national security, job growth, etc - the candidates on the Right were more closely aligned with our views on how to succeed. The vote was not an Anti-Woman referendum.\n \nHomophobists - Not seeing a issues like whom one can marry, or what is the appropriate titling of bathrooms, or who must bake a cake for whom, as being a top-priority national concern for America when we are facing stagnate job growth, continued terrorist threats, nuclear capable countries who maintain an Anti-US position does not make us homophobic. It simply says, be reasonable - at the end of the day how important is to a person in Vermont which bathroom I choose to use in Colorado? At the end of the day, how much time do I spend in public bathrooms anyway - so let’s use our time wisely to address bigger issues.\n \nIn summary - Ignorance is not taking time to see WHY others maintain positions they do. It is typically not out of hate or spite, but rather differing world views. At the end of the day most people on both sides of the aisle want similar things:\nAn ability to provide for ourselves and our families.\nRelative safety in our neighborhoods\nAccess to food and healthcare.\nWe simply disagree on the best avenues to enact the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

A lot sound quite Canadian.\n \nNow to the actual story about the ignorant American ;)\n \nI’m from New Hampshire which is a tiny state in New England. In other words irrelevant. The southern US is very backwards with many conservative zealots who can be quite stupid sounding almost like Donald Trump. The public school system down south is actually a joke, and it makes the whole US look bad. The school systems in New Hampshire are ranked as similar to the ones in Finland which have some of the best school systems in the world.

As it turned out she had never even left Mississippi, and her whole family lived in the same county, so she never really left. Her “comfort zone”, or “radius of knowledge”. To her anything outside of Oktibbeha County, Mississippi is totally foreign.

I have equipment at home. I would work my arms when I got up. Get out of bed start with a set of curls. My theory was that by doing enough to get a pump in the morning, when I came home from work, later at the gym and a few sets to get a blood flush in my arms just before bed. Keeping the blood in the tissue was the goal. I had spectacular results in less than 3 months. I gained over an inch a month on my arms.\n \nI did this in the mid eighties. I ate food that I purchased at the grocery stores and restaurants. I took vitamin supplements. Knox Gelatin and cod liver oil protected my joints.\n \nI lifted heavy, three sets trying for four strict reps and then cheating for the next four but resisting and slowing the eccentric part of the movement which should always be done with a full range of motion, working the eccentric part of the rep to shape the muscles.\n \nWhile the pro bodybuilders at that time were eating jars of baby food while working out I found something better. I didn’t know it at that time either but today it is known through science that when a bodybuilder completes his workout the best way to increase the cells absorption of the post workout protein is for the bodybuilder to eat two slices of white bread or a cup of white rice. The simple sugars in the refined grain tempts the cells to open taking in more of the protein maximizing muscle growth.\n \nIn the afternoon when I returned home from work I would have a snack of peanuts and fresh squeezed cider while doing some arm exercises. The peanuts supplied fat, protein and so many vitamins and minerals as well as arginine. A cup of peanuts has more than 3X the arginine as a most whey servings supplying 40 grams of protein. The natural sugar in the cider opened up the cells sucking in the nutrients while the arginine dilates the cardiovascular system. Before going to bed I would maybe 6 ounces of peanuts and have a glass of apple juice while doing enough arm exercises to get the pump back in.\n \nI was really doing a full workout in the morning, a teaser when I got home from work, a full workout at the gym, and enough to flush and pump my arms just before bed. I ate yogurt, steak, eggs, sardines, baked potatoes, salads, cooked vegetables, whole grain breads, almonds, walnuts, I ate humongous amounts of foods but when I started eating the peanuts and drinking the cider I found the gains in strength and size came much more quickly.", "authorship": "human"}

Eventually I managed to convince our HR guy to cc me in the latest round of emails with Home Office HR re. “the missing identity information of one Mariluz”, and I replied providing:\n \nmy full name (that is, the Spanish version),\nthe version in my US IDs,\nmy Spanish SSN and NIF (the second one is the general Tax ID),\nmy US SSN (which doubles as US Tax ID).\n \nAnd the lady from Home Office wrote back “wait, you can have more than one Social Security number?” “yeah, multiple countries have something called some version of Social Security. But your Social Security and our Seguridad Social aren’t the same thing.”\n \nTurns out they’d been trying to enter my US SSN both as my Número de la Seguridad Social and as my NIF (Tax ID) into a file identified as being from Spain and the program kept snarling “wrong format” on both fields. The program was smarter and better organized than either of the two humans from HR, American or Spanish.", "authorship": "human"}

It seems that a lot of universities and people in general are so easily being used ( by media spinning fake news, by other agitators to go an riot,etc) without them realizing why they are “protesting,rioting, beating the snot out of someone with another viewpoint as them”. When you ask them they spout doctrine that have been given to them by media/agitators/etc without actually being skeptic about the whole thing.\n \nWhy do media push x narrative or opt for narrative Y? What do they have to gain? I will not give a recent example but an old one that is easily googled without getting in the swamp of trump/anti trump swamp. During the Northern Ireland problems in the 1970–2000s some journalists and photographers were caught paying Northern Irish kids to throw rocks at police and start trouble. Back then when there were still ethical boards that actually fact checked the news and the reports, you know what they did? They fired those people and gave them a ban ( depending on the severity and the proof).\n \nNow let us apply this to modern day. These “fact checkers and control organs” do not exist anymore or if they do, they are holed out utterly to the point of being obsolete. You have to ask yourself: Why is CNN telling something like this or that? What do they have to gain by saying this? What political spectrum do they have (donated to hillaries campaign) and is it visible in their reporting ( this is an ear deafening yes, like most mainstream media outlets).\n \nNow armed with these answers ask yourself the following: What does protesting mean for me? Do I benefit from it in any way? If i do protest and it turns violent what will i do? IF i get caught rioting or beating someone up who profits from it? ( the last question is always the media that WANTS riots, it is their bread and butter. IF you riot and “kicking buttskies, the media’s ratings goes up which means more income in advertisements/stock prices will go up etc)\n \nSo who benefits from rioting? The media and they use you, the people to do it and they do not pay you a dime ( even if they did i don’t think a lot of sane people will accept the money or even riot at all). Thus those average joes and janes are reduced to 21st century slaves that listen to the elite mainstream media overlords clacking of the whip.\n \nOf course this isn’t exclusive to the US but the last months it seems that the US is so susceptible to this behavior. Arm yourselves against it by thinking for yourselves, be skeptical about what news says ( be it left, right,etc do your own research if you want to find out the truth). If someone tells you “this is the truth and if you think otherwise you are *insert a curse word or whatever” you know you are dealing with propaganda especially when they do not state facts to back up their claims.\n \nThanks for bearing with me on this rather lengthy piece :)", "authorship": "human"}

The guy is referenced frequently in the media and by policy makers and is on TV giving interviews and graduation ceremonies speeches. I even saw a joint interview with him and Jay-Z one time.

I think my shock factor goes up or down depending on what a certain person does not know that I think they SHOULD know given their age, background, and access to knowledge via their language and modern telecommunication connectivity. Example: I do not expect my 7 year old niece to know basic ingredients for cookies, nor do I expect my 90 year old grandfather to know the different browsers on a computer, nor do I expect some random poor guy in the Central African Republic to name more than one U.S. president or any car company.\n \nLast week, I talked to a 60-70 year old white middle class English speaking American from a red state. She stated that she recently learned from a new friend that “there are two kinds of Muslims! I did not know that!” I mentally face palmed but said nothing. Never mind that there a 4 main branches of Sunni Islam, and various versions of Shia (12′ers and 8′ers), and also got Sufis, and offshoots of Shia such a Alawites, and other groups such as Kurds or Central Asians who might mix in certain customs into one of the Sunni branches. I wouldn’t expect any American to be aware of these nuances unless they were from the Middle East pr studying religion or something.

Every day on TV and in the news paper, those two words were mentioned and referred to in any explanation about the ongoing armed conflict, civil war, and reconstruction effort. Every day for multiple years. Any half discussion on Iraq always includes those two words. Were my expectations too high for this woman to know that there were at least “2 kinds of Muslims”?

Don't lock out the elbows; keep them slightly bent. Extend your legs back so you are balanced on your hands and toes, your feet hip-width apart. Once in this position, here is how you will do a push-up.\nContract your abs and tighten your core by pulling your belly button toward your spine.\nInhale as you slowly bend your elbows and lower yourself to the floor, until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle.\nExhale while contracting your chest muscles and pushing back up through your hands, returning to the start position.\n2. Glute Bridge\n \nA glute bridge is an exercise that can be used to target the gluteal muscles. It is often seen in warm up segments or strength/accessory training segments to increase glute activation, strength, and muscle hypertrophy.\n \nHow To Do It:\nLie face up on the floor, with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground. Keep your arms at your side with your palms down.\nLift your hips off the ground until your knees, hips and shoulders form a straight line. Squeeze those glutes hard and keep your abs drawn in so you don’t overextend your back during the exercise.\nHold your bridged position for a couple of seconds before easing back down.\n3. Toe-touch\n \nStrengthen your abdominal muscles with an exercise that combines the toe touch and the crunch and is sometimes referred to as the toe-touch crunch, or the vertical toe touch.The toe touching ab exercise primarily trains your rectus abdominis -- the muscle that makes up your six-pack. Your core, however, includes your side obliques, transverse abdominis, back stabilizers and pelvic floor.\n \nHow To Do It:\nLie on your back with your palms down by your sides. Bend your knees and bring them toward your torso, then slowly start to straighten your legs. They should ultimately end up perpendicular to the ground.\nLift your arms. While exhaling, slowly roll your shoulders up off the mat, reaching towards your toes. Round your shoulders forward (but keep them down) to create a concave shape with your torso. Your lower back should stay on the ground, but don’t press it into the floor — that’ll flatten the natural curve of your lower back and take you out of the correct position.\nInhale as you lower back down. When you reach the ground, keep the tension in your abs firing. In other words, don’t just relax on the mat.

Depending on my fitness level, exercise could be as simple as taking a short walk to increase my heart rate and blood flow.\n \nI don't need an intense workout such as heavy weightlifting or high-intensity interval training (HIIT).\nHow I exercise depends on my health goals. For example, if I want to lose fat and gain muscle, I will focus on heavy compound movements. In addition, my diet is extremely critical.\n \nTo keep myself motivated, I measure my results.

This is great if your goal is to maintain. But if you want to break through the plateau, your body must experience a higher intensity or resistance.\n \nThis is when progressive overload applies.\n \nTo get stronger and have more muscle for a particular body part, your body must experience a higher amount of resistance.\n \nFor example, if you can lift 125 pounds for your barbell military press for 4 to 6 reps and you want more strength and muscles in your shoulders, you must increase the weights during your workouts. Along with proper macronutrients fueling and rest, you will gain more strength and shoulder definition over time.\nBut the process could take longer if you want to increase muscle and strength while minimizing fat. To do so, you can first bulk to gain fat and muscle. Afterward, you can cut to maintain muscle while losing fat.\n \nHowever, if you're new to weightlifting, you can quickly build muscle while losing fat.\n \nFocus on Exercises which Excite You\n \nIf your goal is to maintain optimal health, then performing enjoyable exercises will be your most desirable and sustainable approach. That's because you're more likely to exercise if you look forward to them. Such options might be a dance class, morning group hike, or a run with your dog.\n \nFor example, one of my personal favorite hobbies is rock-climbing.\nAlthough it's challenging, I look forward to going to the rock-climbing gym because I find it extremely fun and engaging. It's both physically and mentally difficult because I have many ways of finishing the problem.\n \nWorking out with a partner can make your exercise session even more enjoyable, not to also mention accountability - you both don't want to let the other person down.

But if you want to break through the plateau, your body must experience a higher intensity or resistance.\n \nThis is when progressive overload applies.\n \nTo get stronger and have more muscle for a particular body part, your body must experience a higher amount of resistance.\n \nFor example, if you can lift 125 pounds for your barbell military press for 4 to 6 reps and you want more strength and muscles in your shoulders, you must increase the weights during your workouts. Along with proper macronutrients fueling and rest, you will gain more strength and shoulder definition over time.\nBut the process could take longer if you want to increase muscle and strength while minimizing fat. To do so, you can first bulk to gain fat and muscle. Afterward, you can cut to maintain muscle while losing fat.\n \nHowever, if you're new to weightlifting, you can quickly build muscle while losing fat.\n \nFocus on Exercises which Excite You\n \nIf your goal is to maintain optimal health, then performing enjoyable exercises will be your most desirable and sustainable approach. That's because you're more likely to exercise if you look forward to them. Such options might be a dance class, morning group hike, or a run with your dog.\n \nFor example, one of my personal favorite hobbies is rock-climbing.\nAlthough it's challenging, I look forward to going to the rock-climbing gym because I find it extremely fun and engaging. It's both physically and mentally difficult because I have many ways of finishing the problem.\n \nWorking out with a partner can make your exercise session even more enjoyable, not to also mention accountability - you both don't want to let the other person down. In addition to improving your health, you get to spend quality time with them which further deepends your relationship.\n \nProducing many health benefits, exercise is an excellent way to release endorphins, ...", "authorship": "human"}

I mean, boys like girls! Why would he like a guy?”\n \n“That’s who he likes. Some people do, you know.”\n \n“What? Really?”\n \n“Actually, around ten percent of people like the same gender.”\n \n“That’s gross. It’s wrong!” I’m bisexual, but I can handle a reasonable amount of homophobia. I generally don’t try to change people’s opinions on one of their core beliefs, and since she wasn’t saying Nico should die or anything, I did the reasonable thing. I tried to start a discussion on it.\n \n“Why?”\n \n“People are supposed to reproduce.” This was the typical beginning to a decent argument I’ve heard before, so I expected her to start saying that. Instead, she said, “You can’t have babies unless you’re married.” \nUhhh… What?!\n \n“Actually, people who are just dating can have a kid too.” I was also going to explain that gay marriage is now legal.\n \n“No they can’t. It’s physically not possible unless you get married.”\n \n“You mean when a couple are… \ntogether\n?”\n \n“No, getting married, like a wedding.” That is to say, the celebration where women typically wear white.\n \n“What?”\n \n“You know what, this conversation is pointless. You don’t get it. We should just stop.”\n \nShe later proceeded to go on a rant about how we didn’t need plastic or any synthetic materials to maintain our present society the way it is. She also related a series of pretty questionable laws of physics (that is to say, completely and obviously false). In addition, she told us that scientists today had the technology to “magically change the atoms in metal into some sort of big atom that makes up a car that can move on its own” without requiring any sort of energy to move it (or wheels, for that matter). I believe she also declared butter did not contain oil. Yes, she did indeed say “magically”.\n \nPerhaps her parents simply have not told her these things yet. She had clearly gone through puberty, though, so I don’t know why.\n \nI don’t meet a lot of ignorant people, as I generally am surrounded by my rather intelligent, philosophical friends, so maybe she isn’t very ignorant.

Weight loss/fat loss/overall heatlh is like 75% diet, 25% exercise.  So you'll need to do some research on that first (some great sources are eattoperform or bengreenfieldfitness to start).\n \nAs for a weekly plan....  Honestly, I'm apprehesive to suggest anything specific simply because I don't know you or your body and how you respond to movement.  The exercises you mentioned - dance, strength, yoga and running - are all very effective in helping with gaining strength and improving cardio health.  I say try one each day and see what you're drawn to.  You can also try high intensity training (also known at HIT or HIIT).  Even try studios like Orangetheory, Pure Barre, even Crossfit.  See what you'll like and what you're willing to continue with. What piques your interest is what you'll be willing to dedicate your time to and work for.\n \nI do agree that running for weight loss is a tricky topic.  I suggest you do more research on it.  But doing sprints and tempo runs work really well with increasing VO2 max capacities and help bring you into a fat burning mode instead of sugar burning (this is ben greenfield's aim).  \n \nAlternate your workouts.  Don't forget to build in rest.  And working out a solid hour a day HARD isn't necessary.  Get your heart rate up 20-30 minutes a day for strength training and cardio.  Work your body hard during that short time...push yourself.  It'll be more effective than spending an hour in the gym mindlessly lifting weights.  Give yourself some bodywork therapy (pilates, yoga) to balance out the other workouts (those can be an hour - 90 min).   \n \nFinally, while I don't feel comfortable giving  you a specific workout, I can tell you what's worked for me in the past:\n \nDay 1 - strength training (20-30) with a trainer...hard\n \nDay 2 - sprint or tempo work\n \nDay 3 - Pilates\n \nDay 4 - strength training\n \nDay 5 - spring or tempo work \n \nDay 6 - Yoga\n \nDay 7 - Rest\n \nSince I'm a Pilates instructor, I usually do Pilates mat/props 5-6 days a week.

I realized this when I studied history in university ; )\n \nThat being said, I’ve met the same level of geographical and cultural ignorance in every other country I’ve visited (most especially China, but European countries as well). (BTW, never judge a whole country by the representation of a couple of teenagers. Teenagers tend to be pretty dumb. They’re still working it out.)\n \nAmericans are at a unique disadvantage in this regard because the whole world is obsessed with our film, music, politics, culture, etc. So everybody knows what’s going on in our country. This creates a false sense of awareness around the world, and ignorance in America. The truth is, an Italian might know all the current events in American politics, but they probably have no idea what’s going on in Senegal, West Africa. Someone in Columbia might have seen the newest film release from Hollywood, but they don’t have a clue who the most popular pop star is in South Korea, etc. etc. etc. And for that matter, I’ve been met with blank stares from people from Switzerland, the UK, Austria, Australia, etc. when I say I’m from Pennsylvania. They don’t know where Pennsylvania is (just south of New York—they know that one); they just know where America is.\n \nKnowing where America is without knowing where the individual states are is, geographically speaking, not that different from knowing where Europe is, but not knowing the exact borders of each country. There are a lot of cultures, land, and people in between New York and California. This is also why Europeans tend to enjoy international travel much more (and more cheaply) than Americans. Me traveling to San Francisco, my own country, would be like a German traveling well into Russia. And I’ve heard more than once a European or Asian saying they want to travel to all the major landmarks in the U.S. in a week or two. I just smile and nod.\n \nDespite all this, everybody likes to gather together and laugh about how ignorant Americans are. Well, it’s not that simple, and they’re often betraying their own prejudices. All that to say, I don’t expect non-Americans to memorize our state map (that’s not your responsibility) or understand our cultures when all you see are sensationalized headlines in the news and Hollywood blockbusters (and no, I don’t know Kobe Bryant; he’s not my neighbor; yes, I’ve been asked this). But I would love for everybody to judge a bit less. The one thing I’ve learned from traveling the world is that we’re all unbelievably shaped by our immediate surroundings, and none of us has as much justification to judge as we might think.", "authorship": "human"}

But meat and veggies os the way to balance your hormones and lose the fat.\n \nAs for training.. if youve never lifted before i URGE you to hire a trainer. You don't have to work out with a trainer for ever but it is important to learn proper form and technique learn what exercises work what muscle groups and Lauren how hard to push yourself how long to wait between exercises order of exercises excetera excetera. Doing research is great but as I'm sure you have noticed for every answer you find you will find someone who says the opposite. Without a professional guiding you often times it's hard to know what advice to take comma granted not all “expert” advice in the health and field industry is really expert LOL. And not all trainers are created equal. You want someone with at least a year experience ask them about their previous clients and their success stories ask them about their methods and protocols and the reason why they use those methods. If they can't give you concrete answers to those questions look for a different trainer.\n \nI recommend I recommend weight training 2 days a week and doing two days of interval cardio. I like weights on Monday Thursday cardio Tuesday Friday. Focus on major muscle group multi-joint compound movements. No I promise you you will not get big bulky muscles. You will get strong lean and toned. Working the big muscles using the compound exercises burns the most calories and elicit the greatest hormone response and it's the hormones that really get the job done. Lyft hard-and-fast good in work hard for about 30 minutes and go home there's no reason to lift for more than that the training is determined by effort not volume or duration. So push hard for a short time until you feel and then go do something else. Interval cardio means going as hard as you can for a short period And then resting for a short period and repeating. The routine I like is only 4 minutes you go all out maximum Sprint for 20 seconds then walk for 10 seconds and repeat eight times. That routine is clinically proven four times more effective at both muscle building and fat burning when performed twice a week with 100% maximum effort than 60 Minutes of traditional steady state cardio performed five days a week. Yes you read correctly 8 minutes is superior to 300 minutes as long as you push 100%. Good luck.", "authorship": "human"}

It was the regular stay for a lot of civilian contractors for a US base close by. All except one, were truly good folks. We could laugh, joke and drink together in the bar and it was a warm ex-pat feel. The new guy decided to drop his limited overseas understanding out to the barmaid. Dotty knows my wife and kids and has given them loads of tips for stuff to do when I couldn’t get away from the office. The guy was a smoking hole after Dotty planted him with a tirade on things like pointing up the road, “you find me one American grave there, you won’t, and I can show you Canadians and British”. His colleagues were truly embarrassed for unleashing this prick on the locals without a briefing. I got a memory of the other folks having a laugh at dickhead’s expense and leaving Dotty a tip and an apology. One guy in the whole crowd was an ignorant American, the rest were simply a great bunch of folks.\n \nWhat do you mean you don’t want my money?\n \nThis was a whiney east coaster in a cigar shop in Edinburgh. I’m perusing a couple of Cubans and this c#ck pushes ahead of me to the counter as his son wants a cigar and NOW. A middle aged guy in a nice suit was stood by the door. Whiney starts to bitch, moan and make squeaky noises at the counter staff and me. He would not shut up and was making a scene, but no-one really cared. All I wanted was to choose a selection, get it boxed, pay and leave. Whiney has to interrupt me every time I opened my mouth, even thought the rude little turd had shoved his way in. I get bored of bad manners very quickly. Turned to his attendant in the suit, “Bodyguard, minder, that kind of thing?”, Whiney was not engaged, just ranting at the counter folks and suit said with a gentle smile, “just the driver that the hotel provides”. “Excellent, could you tell your cargo that an apology or his teeth are the next things out his mouth?”. Whiney, simply did the third option and fucked off. I’m not saying that he got lot labelled as ignorant was because he was American, but because he was American and made a complete twat out of himself.\n \nSummary\n \nOut of the many folks I have met from the USA, I can only point to those two pricks above as outliers. There are others, but they would be dickheads anywhere on the planet.", "authorship": "human"}

Right after coming up to him they asked me if I was with him and I said -no. They kept on talking to me and ended up asking me if I was on drugs and if I had any narcotics on me because I 'seemed very happy' and repeated that a good few times until it started looking quite serious and until I stopped smiling.)\n \nI was telling him how it would never happen in Europe.\n \nThis guy tells me how it's not true and how he was stopped in Germany randomly and asked for the passport and that he thinks it's because they thought he's a migrant from Africa. Then he says: 'I'm trying to tell them that I'm from from America that I'm an American… '. He kept on repeating this to me. I asked why all this emphasis. He said because there's not a single American who would like to live in Europe. Because America has it all. And they can have anything they want. So there's no point in going anywhere else in the world.\n \nShocking.\n \nI said there are plenty of things.\n \nLike free education.\n \nHe said they have free education too but people are too lazy to look for it. That you can get a scholarship for being white, for being black, for being a male, a female and so on and so forth…\n \nThen I said: 'how about healthcare?'\n \nHe said it's the only thing we have against them but if you're employed then it doesn't matter because you will be insured…\n \nThen I said: 'what about police brutality?'\n \nHe said 'I'm from Harlem and I've never been shot, if they get shot it's for doing something '. I asked him if he's seen all of those videos of people getting killed by the police for no reason. He repeated himself as a broken record with no supporting evidence of his statement. (He was also an African American so it was twice as hard to believe his point of view.)\n \nIt's easy to be ignorant for the things that are far away and don't concern you too much.\n \nIt is a whole different level of being this ignorant in your own country where you get to talk to people and hear their stories or at least to see the news.\n \nThat also came from a person who has traveled and been exposed to different cultures and surroundings.\n \nI wish I had asked him about homelessness and mental health but I'm pretty sure he would've found an answer to that as well.", "authorship": "human"}

This maximizes efficiency.\nHigh-Intensity Training:\n Incorporate techniques like supersets, circuit training, or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to increase the intensity and calorie burn within a shorter time frame.\nProgressive Overload:\n Ensure you are gradually increasing the weight or resistance in your workouts to continue making progress.\nConsistency:\n Stick to a regular workout schedule, whether it’s full-body or split, to maintain progress.\nNutrition and Recovery:\n Pay attention to your diet and recovery strategies, as they are crucial for maximizing results. Ensure adequate protein intake and consider active recovery strategies.\nListen to Your Body:\n Adjust your training volume and intensity based on how your body responds to avoid burnout or injury.\nConclusion\n \nBoth full-body workouts and split routines can be effective, but for minimal time investment, full-body workouts (2-3 times a week) are generally more efficient for most people. However, if you prefer or can commit to a split routine and it fits your goals better, it can also yield excellent results.

It builds explosive strength from the floor, squat strength and quick hip flexion.\n \nTWO\n \nPush press has been showed to produce more rate of force development in the legs than squats or even cleans do. A shorts rom, but enough to give you power to jumpe, sprint etc (which is a short rom too if you break it down). With heavy weights over your head, everything under (back, core, glutes and ofc shoulders girdle) it has to stabilise it, like pillars holding a roof. It devolops massive triceps and delts, even traps and CHEST. Yes. The entire upper body except biceps and. Unlike chest presses, overhead presses develops the delt much much better, and works the meatiest part of the tricep more. You will have a more round chest (less down-heavy like benchers) and wider, rounder delts. Also produces less injury than benching due to more balansed development (and you can actually drop it on the floor, unlike a bench press..). The weight will be heavy AF on the way down since you used legs to get it up. Humans are stronger on exentric reps, and this exercise is actually HEAVIER for that part, which is unique. It may allow you to hold weights close to your max bench OVERHEAD and standing up. Possibly the #1 exercise of all time.\n \nTHREE\n \nWeighted chins will develop the muscles that have already been hit, but not hammered. 2/3 of your torso muscles (or more) will be crushed. Biceps, forearms, lats, rhomboids, rear delts (which compensates for the push press), lower and middle traps, abs and even a bit of upper chest (according to studies). Can be done very heavy.\n \nIf you get to a 1.5x weight on all these exercises (on chins that means adding 50% of your own bw) for a few reps, you will not have any imbalance. Unlike squat bench and dead, these exercise includes explosive training. They will also give you better delts and traps and a more “masculine”chest. You will be more athletic with those, and more balanced. Squat bench dead has no upper body pulling to work biceps and rear delts, and the bench almost exclusively works the front part. Bad. Another benefit is that squats and deads have higher injury risk, but explosive movements with a moderate weight might build the same size without overloading soft tissue.\n \nPlease let me know what you think", "authorship": "human"}

However I was very mindful that this was not my country and not my place to start heated discussions so I was careful to keep a neutral tone in my conversations. The demographics in the dining car of a long distance Amtrak train are quite old. There are lots of retired people who now have the chance to see America at last and they head out on a great Amtrak adventure.\n \nSo I was on the California Zephyr heading towards Denver from San Francisco and I went along for my evening meal. I'd had breakfast earlier in the day with a very ancient man who was convinced that Obama was a ‘'damn moslem’ and I was a bit nervous that I'd get him again. Instead I ended up sat opposite a couple in their mid 60s or so and eventually the conversation turned to politics.

The exterior door was labelled “bagni” (“bathrooms”) and the interior doors were labeled “donna” and “uomo.” I won’t translate those two exotic terms, for reasons that will be soon be evident. But for now, pause for just a moment and take a guess… a wild conjecture… as to what those two terms mean.\n \nI’ll give you a hint. At the moment I was heading to the bathroom, there was a woman who stood in apparent paralysis inside the “bagni” door, but outside the “uomo” and “donna” doors. A man then emerged from the “uomo” door. The woman remained, utterly confused.

Based on American tourists I’ve met in Europe I was expecting them all to be unbearably annoying. Maybe the more ignorant Americans are more noticeable, especially abroad, they talk louder and argue more.\n \nIf you want a story about someone very stupid but not American (in case you’ve read all this thread and now think Americans are the worst):\n \nA girl in my Biology class at school (when we were 17) exclaimed with surprise: “What? Pigeons lay eggs?!” The teacher said “yes, of course. All birds lay eggs.” And she said “Really? Like ducks?” “yes, like ducks. You can buy duck eggs in the shops.”\n \nThis girl, like me, was white, British, middle-class. My parents knew her parents, they were nice and had just as much money. She went to the same primary school (even the same pre-school) as me, so we’ve have the same formal education since we were 4 years old. She has had every opportunity to learn but she went her whole life knowing that chickens lay eggs and she was never, ever bothered to ask about the reproductive arrangements of other birds, or absorb that information when it was given to her (as in must have been at some point, she was 17). Last I heard she went to university, but I don’t know what she studied.\n \nWhen I was a child I had a brain like a sponge, I wish I could learn as easily as I did then. I was also very curious about everything and always asked “why?” I’ve heard this said about children in general, that children are naturally inquisitive and love to learn, and most people I meet agree that this is the case, my own children certainly are. But it seems that some children really don’t care what lays eggs, what language they speak in France, why is the sky blue, what does “coincidence” mean, what are your kidneys for, why is your blood red, what are the Egyptians (these are the sorts of things my son asks me, and other parents say the same sort of things). Sadly it seems that some children simply don’t care, so long as they know the names of the members of the latest pop-band they will be accepted by their peers, and they don’t care about anything else in the world. Some people, it seems, never question anything, even as children, and its not just an American phenomenon.", "authorship": "human"}

That’s for a velocity of over 700 megabytes per second, which is really fast, and there’s no limit to how much I can upload or download.\n \nBut for many Brazilians, that’s really expensive, it’s 10% of their monthly salary for 2/3 of the population. So for the majority of the country internet access isn’t cheap.\n \nInternet service on my phone is R$60.00 (US$12.00) a month. It gives me 22 gigabytes of 4g before my connection speed is reduced to 32k, which works well for text emailing, but that’s about it.\n \nThis price also gives me unlimited calling and unlimited text messages to any landline or cellular phone in Brazil independent of who their or my cellular provider is.\n \nIt’s accompanied with free inter-state roaming, and because it’s a pre-paid plan it’s not linked to the purchase of a phone, so really, it’s not a bad deal.\n \nYet, that still means that a family of four, with both parents working minimum wage jobs, as over 1/2 the country does, is paying R$387.00 (US$78.00) a month for internet and cellular services.\n \nWhen a family makes R$2500.00 (US$500.00) a month, that’s close to 18% of their income, that’s a lot.\n \nNow add in the cost of the phones, which are often financed for two years at interest rates of 10% a month which is 420% a year, yes, you read that right, 420%.\n \nBorrowing money in Brazil is comparable to borrowing money from the mafia in other countries, yet so many people do it, because they want an internet connection.\n \nAnd add in the cost of things like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney and Apple+ on family plans, which aren’t expensive in Brazil, all four cost R$75.00 (US$15.00) a month, much less than in many other countries.\n \nStill, it’s easy to see that for many Brazilians access to the internet is expensive, for half the country it literally affects the amount of food you can eat and what neighborhood you can afford to live in.\n \nSo, yes, there are poor people on Quora, even if internet services in Brazil are 20% of the price they are in the United States.\n \nThe other answers I have read to this question also say the same thing.

But that is for people with especially good recovery abilities.\n \nIt amazes me how much the bodybuilding industry has confused the shit out of people. Telling them to workout 6 times per week, eat 2 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight, and other useless nonsense. Sure that works for the guys taking steroids, but all it does for a natural trainer is lead them nowhere. Yeah, you might experience results in a few months, but after that you’ll stagnate.\n \nFull-body workouts on the other hand, are the perfect routines for natural trainers. They offer enough volume, but not too much to where you can’t recover from. In addition, you’re joints and central nervous system get more of a break and time to recover because you’re not training as often.\n \nAll you need in a full-body workout is a major push, a major pull, and a major legs exercise. The intermediate and advance could also benefit from some assistance exercises for the arms and calves. But other than that, this is all you will ever need to grow. I currently am 6′1 and weigh 203 lbs, at 11 percent body fat. And I have been on a maintenance routine only lifting weights twice per week and sprinting on a third day. I haven’t gained any mass (hence the maintenance routine) but I still have continued to gain strength. One of my example workouts was this:\n \nWeighted Dips: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nWeighted Chin-ups: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nSquats: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nCalf raises and forearms: 2–3 sets of 10–15 reps\n \nWill you get to be 250 at 5 % body fat and become some absolute beast?? Hell no, not even close. But no natural trainer will ever get that close. If you are around 6 feet tall, the most you can ever expect to weight at 10 percent body fat is probably 215 to 220. And those numbers are for someone with very great genetics.\n \nI love how people think they need to follow the split routines 6 days per week because everyone else is doing it.\n \nWell, how many people do you see that are big and strong? Not many. How many people do you see at the gym following those splits who are actually big and NOT taking steroids? Probably zero.\n \nI talk about this in great detail in my book which you can find here: \nBasic But Brutal", "authorship": "human"}

If done in correct form, and if you go below parallel, it will work not only your quads but also hamstrings, glutes and core.\nDeadlift\n \n: \nAlong with squats, deadlift is one of the best exercise to build overall mass and strength. It targets your posterior chain including hamstring, glutes, erector spine & lats. Your core gets a good workout and it also improves your grip strength & forearm size.\nStanding Calves Raise\n \n: \nI do it on smith machine standing on step board. It's best for calves.\nFlat & Inclined\n \nBench Press : \nBest exercise for chest but also works your anterior deltoids(front shoulders) and triceps. You can also do pushups for same effect but you won't be able to use as much weight as in bench press.\nMilitary Press : \nBest exercise to target shoulder.\nBent Over Barbell Rows : \nGood exercise for lats, middle back, biceps & core.\nPull Ups & Chin Ups\n :\n \nBest exercise for lats & biceps.\nParallel Bar Dips\n : Best for triceps.\nHIIT : \nFor cardiovascular health & fat loss. Sprint for 30 seconds and then walk for 30 seconds. Repeat for total 15 to 20 mins.\nYoga Poses : \nFor flexibility & proper alignment of body.\nP.S. : I know Yoga is not a single exercise but I included it to put emphasis on importance of flexibility & mobility work.

Because, in the school I attend, all students are from extremely wealthy families, with an estimated average income of about $15,500.

They all have iPhones, Gucci and Versace threads, expensive suits, and a lot of admirers.\n \nOn the other hand, I travel by public transport. My family has ONE car.

We dine out at normal restaurants, and I have never been abroad. Only domestic.\n \nSpending hours with these kind of people from societies that I don’t belong to, had been a very sad part of my life. I did not want to attend school anymore. I didn’t want to use public transport anymore. I was tired, sick of my life. The poor kid sleeping on the road would be jealous of my life, but I was sick of it.\n \nThen, I thought about it, I thought how hard my parents work, just for my benefit. I thought, that I must give my parents, what I desire. Not expect them to give it to me. And here I am today, renowned all over my school, as THE artist, THE physicist, THE swimmer, and THE debator.\n \nYes, it was my self confidence, that helped me change myself.

Each milestone (10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 100, 200, 300, 365 days) gives a huge mental boost. The first 100 are the hardest, but then it feels easy.\nWho You Run With: \nNever run alone. If you are not running with a friend or a run club, listen to your favorite artist for motivation. Create a Spotify playlist that makes you want to dance. Runners and Artists give you energy.\nWhat to Prep: \nSet your shoes and clothes out the night before your run. If you run in the morning, set it in your room so you see it right when you wake up. If you run at night, pack your clothes and shoes the day before in a gym bag.\nWhere to Run\n: Create a portfolio of your favorite routes near your home or work. Where have you already been training? You know these tracks, trails and streets like your own home, so you are confident going into these runs.\nWhen to Run\n: Run at the same time everyday. Block out the time on your schedule when it is the best time for you to run. The more consistent you are, the easier this gets. If your health is a priority, do it first thing in the morning every day after waking up so there are no excuses.\nListen to your Body\n: You will know your body better than anyone if you built a base first. Recovery is key. If you aren’t recovering between runs, then walk. Go back to the foundations. Easy days, healthy nutrition, and adequate sleep are the foundation.\nWhy Do You Run\n: There will be days that are going to be hard. Shitty weather. Low energy.

Check out Prilepin tables for a rough guide:\nYour rest periods will depend on your training. The heavier you're lifting, the longer rest you need between sets. If you're training in the 1-5 rep range, you may need 4-5 minutes rest between sets. This will decrease as you move to lower rep ranges. If you're training with 9-12 reps, you may only need 30-60 seconds of rest between sets. (Keep in mind this is just a rough guideline)@\nPush yourself to technical failure (not absolute failure). Meaning: once your form stars to deteriorate, you should stop within 1-2 reps. Remember: your body ALWAYS adapts to EXACTLY what you do and continuing to train after technical failure will engrain bad movement patterns. \nDefinitely listen to music!

Our conversation went a little like this,\n \nMe: “Hi my name is Lexi. I’m from Ohio.”\n \n*Two Girls Exchange Looks*\n \n*Guy Pushes up His Glasses*\n \nGuy: “O-Ohayo? Isn’t that in like… Japan?”\n \nFirst off, for all you folks who don’t know what caused the confusion “おはよう” is a Japanese word meaning “good morning” it’s the casual form. Even as a nerdy teen myself the only Japanese show I had ever seen was Sailor Moon and it was the crappy dubbed version so I had no idea what he was talking about.\n \nMe: “N-No, it’s a stat—”\n \nGirl 1 to Guy: “Why would they name an American state after a Japanese word?”\n \nGuy: “Maybe an Asian dude discovered it?”\n \nGirl 2: “You guys can’t be this dumb.”\n \nI remember getting really excited because I was losing all hope.\n \nGirl 2: “Ohio is a country in America.”\n \nGuy: “It’s possible for countries to be inside countries?”\n \nGirl 1: “America is a continent you idiot.”\n \nGirl 2 *Looks at me and smiles*: “How do you like America so far?”\n \nI couldn’t believe my mind, these teenagers thought Ohio was a freaking country. I opened my mouth to correct them before catching myself and nodding.\n \nMe: “It was nice meeting you, see you again some other time.”\n \nGirl 2: “You don’t want to stay and hang out with us? We have soda in the refrigerator and chips. We were about to go inside and watch some movies too.”\n \nMe: “Ah no t-that’s alright I have to go back to my… \ncountry\n.”\n \nThey seemed upset and waved to me as I left, they somehow knew my grandmother too and would ask me when I’d be back so I could hang out with them. They were a nice group of kids just… Not the brightest. I didn’t talk to them ever since that day. I told my mom about it and she lost it.\n \nMerica’", "authorship": "human"}

It is important to exercise and the time you choose to do so has little effect with regard to your results.\n(Pic of me working out at mid night)\n \nThat being said, I have been training in the mornings for years now for various reasons. Here is why I think it helps:\n \nWorkout in the mornings:\n \nIf you’re on the fence about starting a morning workout routine, consider the following benefits.\nFewer distractions.\nMorning workouts typically mean you’re less prone to distractions. When you first wake up, you haven’t started tackling the day’s \nto-do list\n. You’re also less likely to get phone calls, text messages, and emails.\n \nWith fewer distractions, you’re more likely to follow through with your workout.\nBeat the heat.\nIn the summer, working out in the morning will feel more comfortable, as the hottest part of the day is 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. It’s recommended to avoid outdoor exercise during this time.\n \nIf you prefer outdoor activities, it’s best to work out in the early morning, especially on very hot days.\nIncreased alertness.\nA morning workout may be a better match for your body’s hormonal fluctuations.\n \nCortisol is a hormone that keeps you awake and alert. It’s often called the stress hormone, but it only causes problems when there’s too much or too little of it.\n \nTypically, cortisol increases in the early morning hours and drops in the evening. It reaches its peak around 8 a.m. If you have a healthy circadian rhythm, your body might be more primed to exercise at this time.\nBetter focus.\nPhysical activity also improves \nfocus and concentration\n, regardless of when you do it. But if you have trouble focusing during the day, a morning workout might be just the ticket.\n \nA 2019 study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that morning exercise improves attention, visual learning, and decision-making.\n \nIn the study, participants completed a round of 8-hour days of prolonged sitting with and without a 30-minute morning walk on the treadmill. On some days, they also took 3-minute walking breaks every 30 minutes.\n \nThe days with morning exercise were associated with better cognition throughout the day, especially when paired with regular breaks.\n \nIf a morning workout does not fit into your schedule, make it a point to move actively in the evening!\n \nA well-structured 45-minute fitness routine done four times a day is more than enough to help you seek its benefits.", "authorship": "human"}

The owners had always treated us nicely, and knowing the situation they went out of their way to make me feel at home there. The restaurant had an open kitchen set off by a counter. I could sit there on my own without feeling self-conscious about it, and talk with the owners.\n \nThe owners’ oldest son went off to college so they had hired a young woman, 19 or 20 years old, to work as a waitress. After a couple of months, the owners started talking about setting us up. I treated it as a joke, but the third or fourth time the owners brought it up the young lady said she would be interested. I got the feeling she was being a good employee and just playing along. and I didn’t feel ready to start dating. The age difference seemed a bit much to me, too, so I made excuses.\n \nI couldn’t deny, though, that she was very, very pretty, and in our limited interaction she was very friendly, and the owners were very, very persistent… So I finally asked her out to a movie and then afterward we went to a pub for a drink and dessert. That’s when we actually tried to have a real conversation.\n \nIt quickly became apparent that not only did we had very little in common, she didn’t know much about the world we live in either - outside of the confines of our small city, and outside of the interests of her circle of teenage friends. Trying to find something that we could talk about was painful!\n \nEventually, I did mention where I worked, and it turned out that her father worked for the same company. He had worked there all her life. Finally, there was an opening to ask a follow-up question! It was a big computer company, and I didn’t recognize her father’s name, so I asked what kind of work he did. She had no idea! I tried to lead her through it: engineering, sales, finance, HR, legal, manufacturing, hardware, software… Nothing rang a bell! She did know that the company made computers, but that was the extent of it. She had never seen her father’s office, never absorbed or asked any questions about what he did.

It upset me, though, that they didn't mention his name at all.

I wasn't sure what that meant, since no one has ever said that before, and I wasn't sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing. My friend Justin, when I’d asked him what that meant, just told me it meant I sounded different than he did, and that was okay because he had an accent too (he was from Tennessee).

I knew I was somewhat overweight, but I have lost over 20 pounds, while putting on at least 8-10 pounds of muscle – – which means I lost close to 30 pounds of fat. It's remarkable how much fat can hide internally (especially in men) in the abdomen!\n \nI watched the clock turn back.\n \nIt's not just that I am stronger and better built – – my skin tone/elasticity is noticeably better, my mood is brighter, my energy level is much greater – – my general sense of well-being and – – \"alive-ness\" — feels like I have returned to my 40s.\n \nThere is more and more evidence that intelligent weightlifting – – consistent, and intense enough to be genuinely challenging – – can not only retard the aging process, but to some degree, reverse it.\n \nThat has certainly been my experience. Of course, my stamina is not what it was 30 years ago, and 45/50 minutes of intense work is my limit, unless I push so hard that I stop looking forward to workouts – – and run the risk of losing focus toward the end – – which is when you inevitably hurt yourself.\n \nSo I do one body part a day — actually, I divide legs up, and do some legwork on three of those days to make it less brutal – – and I continue to make real progress, look forward to my workouts, and I do not in anyway feel I am over-training.\n \nI think every-day is pushing it. But you can definitely do more than three days a week, if you want to — if you do it intelligently, find what works for you (for me, it is weights heavy enough that I am limited to 6–8 reps per set in most cases), and FOCUS INTENTLY ON EVERY REP TO AVOID INJURY.\n \nMy experience is that five days a week is healthy, fun, and productive. And if you stick with it and push yourself just enough – – the results can be nothing short of magical.", "authorship": "human"}

While many might argue over the merits of various toppings and spreads, I can confidently assert that avocado reigns supreme as my favorite sandwich ingredient.\n \nFirst and foremost, the texture of avocado is nothing short of magical. Its creamy, buttery consistency adds a luxurious mouthfeel that enhances the overall bite of any sandwich. Whether it’s slathered on as a spread, sliced and layered, or mashed into a flavorful mixture, avocado seamlessly integrates with other ingredients while still maintaining its unique identity.\n \nFlavor-wise, avocado boasts a mild earthiness that serves as an excellent backdrop for a myriad of flavor profiles. It pairs beautifully with zesty ingredients like tomatoes, onions, and pickles, perfectly balancing their acidity with its rich creaminess. Furthermore, it complements savory proteins such as turkey, chicken, or even bacon, enhancing the overall savory experience without overpowering other flavors. A sprinkle of salt and a dash of lime can take this ingredient to a whole new level, providing a fresh burst of taste that energizes the palate.\n \nOne of the most appealing aspects of avocado is its versatility. It fits perfectly into various sandwich styles—be it a classic club, a refreshing veggie pack, or even a bold and spicy sriracha chicken creation. Its adaptability knows no bounds, allowing it to be featured in both cold and hot sandwiches with equal success. Additionally, for those who prioritize health, avocados are loaded with beneficial nutrients like healthy fats, fiber, and vitamins, making them not just a delicious choice, but a nutritious one too.\n \nWhile some might debate the issue of ripeness or the daunting task of slicing the perfect avocado, the rewards far outweigh the risks. A perfectly ripe avocado can transform an ordinary sandwich into something truly special.\n \nIn conclusion, if you’re seeking to elevate your sandwich game, look no further than the humble avocado. With its creamy texture, versatile flavor, and health benefits, it rightfully claims the top spot as my favorite sandwich ingredient. Whether you’re crafting a casual lunch or impressing guests at a gathering, incorporating avocado will undoubtedly impress and satisfy—proving that sometimes, simplicity is key to perfection.", "authorship": "human"}

Be cautious about your posture while doing any back exercise which means standing straight (or knees bent in some exercises) and contracting your traps while pushing your chest outwards and keeping your lower back straight by pushing your hips outwards (in exercises in which you are supposed to bend your knees).

He even insisted given that distances are way shorter in Europe they could spend the day over there and come back for dinner in Brussels, stay overnight, and catch their plane the day after!\n \nAt that point, they were both intrigued. The lady asked about how the actual “short distance was”, and her husband wondered how far Germany was exactly.

The revelations of the past week of his vile and crude boasting about sexual conquest—indeed, sexual assault—might have been shocking, but they should have surprised no one.\n \n“Indeed, there is hardly any public person in America today who has more exemplified the ‘earthly nature’ (‘flesh’ in the King James and the literal Greek) that Paul urges the Colossians to shed: ‘sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, and greed, which is idolatry’ (3:5). This is an incredibly apt summary of Trump’s life to date. Idolatry, greed, and sexual immorality are intertwined in individual lives and whole societies. Sexuality is designed to be properly ordered within marriage, a relationship marked by covenant faithfulness and profound self-giving and sacrifice. To indulge in sexual immorality is to make oneself and one’s desires an idol. That Trump has been, his whole adult life, an idolater of this sort, and a singularly unrepentant one, should have been clear to everyone.\n \n“And therefore it is completely consistent that Trump is an idolater in many other ways. He has given no evidence of humility or dependence on others, let alone on God his Maker and Judge.

As I’m in the office 3 days a week (with access to a gym) my current routine is as follows:\n \nDay 1:\n \nBarbell Bench Press 12/10/8/8\n \nDB Flys 12/12/12\n \nBarbell Rows 12/10/8/8\n \nLat Pull Down 12/12/12\n \nBarbell Military Press 12/10/8/8\n \nBarbell Upright Rows 12/12/12\n \nDay 2:\n \nBarbell Squat 12/10/8/8\n \nBarbell Lunge 12/12/12\n \nDeadlift 12/10/8/6\n \nSmith Machine Calf Raise 15/15/15\n \nDay 3:\n \nIncline Dumbell Chest Press 12/12/12\n \nClose Grip Pull Downs 12/12/12\n \nSeat Arnold Press 12/12/12\n \nCable Curls/Tricep Pull Downs Superset 12/12/12/12\n \nLying Leg Raises x20\n \nAngels & Devils 1 min\n \nThings to keep in mind when executing the workout:\nAlways control the weight (do not let the weight control you)\nThink about what muscles are contracting and focus your power there\nAlways have a tight core with each movement - this creates a stable base for each exercise and reduces risk of injury\nRest 60–90 seconds between each set\nCalorie Surplus\n \nYou will need to consume more calories than you are burning to build muscle (the opposite is true if you want to shed some weight).\n \nThere is a bit of work upfront as you’ll need to find your baseline and track how much food you are eating. A good starting point are the numerous BMR calculators available (I use the MyFitnessPal one) and then adjust based on the amount of activity you undertake during the day (I use my smart watch to give me guides).\n \nWhen I first started I was surprised at how much more I actually needed to eat to exceed the calories I was burning. Adding a protein shake between meals has helped get these numbers up.\n \nRecovery\n \nThe final ingredient and arguably the most important.\n \nIf you don’t let your muscles (and body) recover then it will not be able to adapt to the stimulus your workout has provided. Muscles grow when you rest so recover harder than you train. Prioritise your sleep and make sure you listen to your body’s needs.\n \nWhen your body is recovered your workouts can be executed with a greater intensity and that will ultimately be the most effective if you want to build muscle.\n \nSO\n…the most effective workout routine to build muscle incorporates:\nCompound Lifts executed 3 days a week\nCalorie Surplus - fueling your body more than it burns\nRecover - give time for your muscles to grow\nI hope that helps.

Naturally, lot of rather inexperienced people were recruited, or pushed through the ranks.\n \nIn Houston, we were ‘hosting’ a team of USCG personnel, who insisted upon checking the whole vessel armed with scary looking weapons, ammo good to go.\n \nThe Captain's feeble attempts at explaining that it wasn't a good idea to consider firing a round while you were aboard a ship loaded with 30 thousand tons of highly explosive propane was met with general derision from the ‘protectors of American way of life'!!\n \nAnyway, I got tasked with accompanying the team inspecting the deck area. The 3 ‘coasties' were most interested in ascertaining if I was an Arab. That out of the way, they thawed a bit (I am not Arab, incidentally). The least hostile one then decided to ask me the question I shall never forget.\n \n“So Mr. Mate, tell me which is the farthest place you have ever been to?”. My jaw dropped! Was he kidding?! No, not at all. An answer was expected of me.\n \n“From where?” I ask. Now the coastie is already a bit confused. “Er, you are Indian, right? So which is the farthest place from India you have been to?”\n \n“Here. This place. Houston”, I tell him.\n \nI shall never forget his face. Utter confusion written on it. “How can this be the farthest place from ANYWHERE? I mean this is Houston, right?! This IS the centre of the world!”\n \nI had multiple experiences of similar kind. I was asked by one security personnel if I was Russian. And I am as Indian looking as is possible! He was friendly. But his ‘reason for asking' was that there was apparently an active Russian gang around that area indulging in stealing car stereos!! He was just ‘making sure'!\n \nI am trying not to generalize. Maybe it had to do with the fact that I was a sailor on high risk ships. We met the same kind of security personnel every time we sailed into US.

I am currently on social assistance. I had previously tried to go to university when I was 17 and found myself in hospital for mental illness related issues and had to drop out. I make paintings right now but they don’t generally sell, mainly because I am too ill to manage getting a portfolio together, applying to galleries, and I cannot afford the costs associated with applying.\n \nI often do not eat, and I cannot generally afford luxuries. My rent is $375/month CAD, which is only so low because I share a room with my partner. Utilities are $80/month (internet as part of this), and I have leftover around $100 for basic needs for the month. I try to grocery shop and grow food and bake my own bread whenever I can in order to save on food, and keep an eye on sales on canned food and things like vinegar for cleaning and toilet paper. I share a home with three other adults, ages 19–28. We’ve also had homeless friends stay here sometimes when they’ve needed it. (When you live homeless as a young person around here, I think it’s typical to stay at different friends’ places in rotation so as to avoid putting too much pressure on anyone in particular, especially because of the weirdness of social protocol and figuring out whether you count as a guest or a temporary roommate.)\n \nI would love to share pictures of my home but it’s really messy and also I would need to ask my roommates if that’s alright, since the mess belongs to a bit of all of us.

He adamantly rebutted what I said, since ‘I have never enrolled anybody in kindergarten, so I obviously wouldn't know what is necessary’. He truly thought/thinks that medical insurance was a necessary requirement to be enrolled in kindergarten!

While it is difficult to pinpoint a single person as the “most ignorant” American I have ever met, I can recount an interesting encounter that shed light on the importance of education and open-mindedness.\nA few years ago, I had the opportunity to engage in a conversation with an individual during a social gathering. Let’s call him John. John was a middle-aged man who held strong opinions about various topics, particularly politics and world affairs. As our conversation progressed, it became evident that John had limited exposure to diverse viewpoints and relied heavily on sensationalized media sources for information.\n \nOne topic that stood out during our discussion was climate change. John firmly believed that climate change was a hoax, dismissing the overwhelming scientific consensus and evidence supporting its existence. His arguments were based on misconceptions and misinformation propagated by climate change skeptics. Despite attempts to present factual data and studies, John remained resistant to accepting any alternative perspective.\n \nWhat struck me about this encounter was not just John’s skepticism but his unwillingness to critically evaluate new information. It highlighted the importance of intellectual curiosity and the ability to challenge one’s own beliefs. In a rapidly changing world where information is easily accessible, it is crucial to remain open-minded and consider multiple perspectives.\n \nIgnorance, in this context, can be seen as the lack of exposure to accurate and reliable information. ignorance is not necessarily a permanent state but rather a condition that can be overcome through education and a willingness to learn. Encountering individuals like John serves as a reminder of the significance of promoting critical thinking and fostering a culture of lifelong learning.\n \nWhile John may have exemplified ignorance on the topic of climate change, it is essential to approach such encounters with empathy and understanding. Instead of labeling someone as the “most ignorant,” it is more constructive to recognize the gaps in knowledge and engage in meaningful conversations that encourage learning and growth.", "authorship": "human"}

The young lady initially puzzled if it was real money, then, still dubious, tried to reject taking the bills as she had no clue how to take “this money” into the register.\n \nAfter a moment of surprised silence, “Well, I would think entering $4 would be simple as it adds to $4.” This was countered with, “No, no, there’s got to be more”.\n \nMore what? Likely due to the dumbstruck expression on my face, a manager stepped up and asked if he could help and the young lady thrust the bills at him with the frustrated squeak, “What do I do with these if they’re actually real money? How does this go into the register? \nWhat keys do I push?!\n”\n \nAnother awkward silence while the manager had a jaw drop moment equal to mine, followed by, “2 + 2 is 4. Enter $4 and give back the change”. The manager gathered coins and handed them to me with, “I’m so very sorry, I hope you have a great day.”\n \nSecond moment was depositing a stack of 20 dollar bills at the bank. An obviously new trainee teller came to a halt and signaled her mentor at the next window. Although she was trying to be discreet, it was plain she thought the cash was questionable.\n \nThe other teller was a long-term employee of silvering hair, one I had known for years. She carefully sifted through the bills and then looked quizzically at the younger teller, who came back with, “Look, they’re not all the same … they should all look like this.” She held up one of the newer updated colorful 20 dollar bill.\n \nSorry, short string for me, I busted into giggles. The older teller struggled to not follow into hilarity and quietly explained that the green bills were older bills and perfectly good tender. Poor girl looked astonished as she’d never seen such money before.\n \nAfter a mutual facepalm moment, my comment to the seasoned employee was, “Mercy, I suddenly feel ancient!” Her reply, “I really can’t describe aloud what I’m thinking or feeling.” Her expression spoke volumes.", "authorship": "human"}

Pink and White\n \nPink pairs beautifully with white, creating a fresh, bright look. This combination works particularly well in casual settings, such as summer outfits or home decor, where light pink can be paired with white furniture or decor to create a clean look.\n \n2. Pink and Gray\n \nGray is a great neutral backdrop for pink. The softness of pink with gray creates a sophisticated and modern look that’s perfect for clothing and interior design. Light pink can soften the starkness of gray tones, making them more appealing.\n \n3. Pink and Black\n \nFor a bold statement, pairing pink with black can create a striking contrast. This combination is common in the fashion world, where bright pink outfits are paired with black accessories or bottoms, adding an edgy touch to the overall outfit.\n \n4. Pink and Blue\n \nBlue tones, especially softer shades like pale blue or denim blue, pair well with pink. This combination creates a tranquil vibe and works well both in fashion (like a pale pink shirt with blue jeans) and in home decor (like light pink walls with navy furniture).\n \n5. Pink and Green\n \nDue to their opposite positions on the color wheel, greens complement pink beautifully. This pairing ranges from soft mint greens paired with pale pinks to darker emerald greens paired with bolder pinks for a vibrant look.\n \n6. Pink and Brown\n \nBrown tones add warmth when paired with pink, creating an earthy yet stylish hue.

The wizard will generate a simple project structure with stub code that you can explore and run right away.\n \nThen, as you start writing code, CLion will highlight its structure and suggest improvements. This allows you to learn both the language itself and the best code practices from the very beginning.\n \nFor many error cases, CLion suggests quick-fixes, which means you can start memorizing the proper solutions right off the bat. For example, the IDE catches typical errors like dangling pointers – the types of errors that might pop up a lot when you’re a newbie but can also be hard to debug.\n \nThe building, running, and debugging processes are completely transparent, as are VCS operations. You can control every step, see the exact commands, parameters, and flags that are being used, and experiment with them. If necessary, you can always perform the same actions in the built-in terminal.\n \nCLion allows you to become familiar with a variety of compilers and build systems. It works with gcc, Clang, MSVC compilers, and project formats, such as CMake, Makefile, Meson, and others.\n \nUnderstanding the underlying assembly is important when you’re learning a language like C++. CLion allows you to examine the assembly of a file without having to build the entire project. You can change the compiler flags, refresh the assembly view, and see the effect immediately.\n \nAnd, of course, the IDE debugger is very convenient for learning. The IDE will help you investigate any runtime problem, including those that require memory analysis and disassembly.\n \nTo summarize, CLion will not overwhelm you with a complex set-up process and will not hide the essentials in the background. You’ll be able to get up and running with a project in no time, while learning best code practices and efficient debugging right out of the gate.\n \nAnd if you’re a student, you can get it all for free!", "authorship": "human"}

We even have a saying for that: A soldier who doesn't want to be a general is a bad soldier. Which means you must want more or otherwise you're wrong.\n \nPeople answering that question shared their stories of going from cruel poverty to comparably better living. They make high standards for themselves, they put goals and achieve them.\n \nLesson 2: Work more\nThat's simple. If you make no effort, you will make no progress. You'll get nowhere. No work, no money; no bees, no honey.\n \nPeople on Quora have to work in the grain field for a couple of $ a day to pay for their education. They learn and work without restraint to overcome the cycle of poverty.\n \nLesson 3: Compare to less\nI always compare myself to people who have more: more money, more knowledge, more free time, more muscles, more beard... It seems natural to all of us.\n \nBut what if we start comparing to those, who have less than we do? This post on Quora is a cold shower every time I start complaining of how tired I am, or how unlucky I am living in Ukraine, or how cheap my work is.\n \nComparing to those, who have fewer switches you from grudge to thankfulness. You learn how much you already have.\n \nI am not going to preach that we should stop to want more and enjoy the silence of wealth.

I can't tell you that you won't see your results peak at some point if you vary your workouts, but it is less likely to happen across ALL workouts at the SAME TIME.\nInjury\n - If you keep forcing your body to do the same sets of exercises over and over again, it will eventually break down. I vaguely understood this point in my 20s, I fully embrace it now in my...slightly older age. ;)\nMaximum Benefits\n - Speaking in general terms, long distance running helps with endurance and efficiency. Sprinting guards against the loss of muscle mass and provides explosion. Weightlifting helps build/tone muscle mass and can speed up metabolism. Yoga and pilates provide flexibility and balance.\ntl;dr\n \nIf you can find a way to add multiple elements into your workout routine, you will be better off.\n \nEDIT: Always find nits after I hit \"submit.\"", "authorship": "human"}

But after a few weeks, your strength will increase, and you will find yourself getting worn out. If you what to gain mass, you need to focus on individual parts of your body. It also depends if you want to be a body builder or just get big a strong. If you want to get big, just do compound movements, like squats, deadlifts, bench press and rowing movements for your back. Basically you are working your largest muscles, that will work you hard and burn 🔥 calories, and condition your cardio respiratory system. Even if you want to become a body builder, I believe that's where you would start. The smaller muscles with automatically grow because of the metabolic boost from working these large muscles. Do this for about 6 months. But always remember to learn the proper form for any movements you do. Go very light and build up. Squats for example, take some time to get comfortable doing. Do not rush to get huge. Safety and consistency and great nutrition, and make sure you are fully recovered between workouts. The growth and strength increases happen out of the gym. After six months, reevaluate, if you want to become a body builder, you can start doing your smaller muscles, like triceps, biceps, shoulders, forearms and calfs. One other very important caveat, learn to stretch your muscles after your workouts, not before. If you do not stretch regularly, our bodies get tight as we age and it leads to joint problems etc. I love to do zone 2 training on a bike or stationary bike, or I use the stair machine. Zone 2 is under the lactate threshold. Which means you can carry on a conversion for a couple of sentences but no so easy that you could sing a song. I use a heart rate monitor since the first came out I believe in the late eighties. I am 64, I have been doing fitness for 35 years consistently.

As I sat down in front of him, he started out:\n \nhim: You guys want to hear a great story about this weekend?\n \nNobody is really paying attention at this point as he was broadcasting in general and not to anyone specific.\n \nhim: It was a good day Saturday. I got me a cat.\n \nOne of the girls perked up at that point: Oh yeah, what kind of cat?\n \nhim: A grey cat with a white spot on his chest. I think one of his feet was white.\n \nGirl: Ohhh, cute. Is he Spayed or Neutered?\n \nhim: No. Sort of.\n \nOther girl chiming in: You should get the cat spayed or neutered, can’t remember which.\n \nOther girl 2 chiming in: Yeah, it’s neutered. You should get it neutered.\n \nhim: Oh? I guess you could say he’s neutered or spayed. I saw him in the back out by the garage and I went and got my pistol. Right between the eyes. Clean shot.\n \nGirls in unison: Ewww.\n \nMe: Really? What caliber, a .45?\n \nhim: Naw, a .45 would have messed him up, I thought about grabbing the rifle, but probably would have gone clean through. I used a .22.\n \nhim (trying to recapture the attention of the female crowd who turned away): Funny thing about it. I called the Chinese restaurant and they didn’t want the cat.\n \nMe: That’s because you ruined the best part of the cat, the brain.\n \nHe could clearly see that I am Chinese and sitting one chair away, never heard the sarcasm or understood that he was being racist ass, but this was common in Indiana.", "authorship": "human"}

The Cantor (also music director) had no problems with it. The Pastor certainly didn’t object, nor did their Choir Director.\n \nOnly one person ever complained, an old woman at the Methodist Church who told me that it was a sin for me to worship Friday nights at the Jewish Temple. She also said that the TV Network was airing “The Ten Commandments” on Easter Evening that year as part of a Jewish plot to keep a Christian movie from being aired on Easter.\n \nShe just could not understand when I pointed out that “The Ten Commandments” is just as much a Christian movie as it is a Jewish movie.", "authorship": "human"}

I flew to the US for the first time a few years ago. I had my final exam in Analogue Electronics and my flight was the next day. So the night before my flight, exhausted from overworking myself and packing, I open my notebook that I had been practicing questions in and and quickly jot down the flight times, gates etc and rip it out. and flew out the very next day to the US, landing in Chicago.\n \nI land in the US and check in to immigration; empty my pockets along with the paper which coincidently had part of a circuit schematic and notes such as ‘pin 2 to ground’ at the back and forgot about. The officer gets suspicious and starts asking me about it and I explained why it’s there. I then get the ‘random search and interrogation’ by customs officers and interviewed about what countries I visited, he got really confused that I had a British passport and that I was telling him i’ve never been to Pakistan (he didn’t seem to be able to grasp that not all south asian people are from Pakistan). He carried on asking me how is it I’m from England and hold a British passport so I had to explain to him British history from the 60’s onwards. He also interrogated me about the circuit on the back of the paper, luckily I had my student ID card with me. I was convinced I was heading to Gitmo after they saw that.\n \nMy luggage got held up because of flights being cancelled so only had my hand luggage. Another officer escorts me to pick it up and check it; he was satisfied and proceeded to ask me “How is it you know such good English?”. It really puzzled him that I wasn’t white and from England - what shocks me more is that this is US immigration officers i’m talking about, let alone the public.\n \nEdit: Also forgot to add my friend had flown out a few days prior and when he got interviewed, he was asked the question: “Have you ever had any military training?” he answered with “Does Call of Duty count?”, the officer wasn’t too impressed and replied “No, I mean any \nreal\n military training”.", "authorship": "human"}

Then you have to work on your weaker aspects and strengthen them.\n \nYou will definitely pick more weight with gradual time. It's foolish to state a fixed time. Understand that the body gets adapted to a certain weight after some time and then we have to pick more, to feel that same punch there. The flow will carry on. Thus, you will definitely pick more weight after some time and maybe much more than you are presently imagining.\n \nYou must also understand your target. What do you want to do?

This isn't your typical shrug; using a snatch grip (a wide grip) on the barbell really targets the upper traps more intensely than a regular grip.\n \nTo perform it, I stand with my feet shoulder-width apart, grip the barbell with my hands spaced wider than shoulder-width, and then shrug my shoulders up towards my ears. The wider grip increases the range of motion and really isolates the traps. I do three sets of 10-12 reps, focusing on a slow, controlled movement and a strong contraction at the top.\nAnother exercise that has yielded fantastic results for my traps is the \nFace Pull with External Rotation\n. This exercise not only works the traps but also hits the rear delts and improves shoulder health.\n \nUsing a cable machine with a rope attachment, I set the pulley at about face height. I pull the rope towards my face, focusing on keeping my elbows high and squeezing my shoulder blades together. At the end of the pull, I rotate my wrists outward to emphasize the contraction in my traps and rear delts. I aim for three sets of 15 reps, keeping the movement slow and controlled to maximize muscle engagement.\n \nLastly, the \nDumbbell Farmer's Walk\n is an underrated but incredibly effective exercise for building trap strength and endurance. I grab the heaviest dumbbells I can handle and walk back and forth across the gym. The constant tension from holding the heavy weights forces my traps to engage and support my shoulders.\n \nI usually do this for 3-4 sets, walking for about 30-60 seconds each set. Not only does this build my traps, but it also improves my grip strength and overall core stability.\n \nThey might not be the most common choices, but their effectiveness is undeniable.

To explore this, it's essential to consider several key factors, including the global digital divide, the nature of poverty, and the demographics of Quora's user base.\nThe Global Digital Divide: Despite the increasing affordability of internet access, a significant digital divide persists worldwide. This divide is not just about access to the internet but also about the quality of access, including speed and reliability. While in many developed countries, high-speed internet is ubiquitous and relatively cheap, in numerous developing countries, access remains limited, expensive, or both. This disparity is evident in the International Telecommunication Union's data, which reveals vast differences in internet penetration rates across different regions.\n \nNature of Poverty: Poverty is a multifaceted issue that involves more than just income levels. It includes aspects like access to education, healthcare, and technology. People living in poverty, even in regions with relatively high internet penetration, may prioritize basic needs such as food and shelter over internet access. Moreover, poverty often correlates with limited educational opportunities, which in turn affects individuals' ability to engage with platforms like Quora that are primarily text-based and require a certain level of literacy and knowledge to navigate and participate effectively.\n \nDemographics of Quora's User Base: Quora, as a platform, tends to attract users who are interested in sharing knowledge and engaging in intellectual discourse. This demographic is likely to include individuals with at least a basic level of education and digital literacy. Consequently, the platform may inherently appeal less to those who, due to socioeconomic constraints, have had limited access to educational resources.\n \nAccessibility and Inclusivity on Quora: While Quora is accessible to anyone with internet access, there are barriers beyond just the physical ability to log onto the site.

Individuals typically lift about 60 percent of their body weight when completing a push-up.\n \nThere are many different variations of the push-up, so take your pick. Just make sure that push-ups are a part of your training everyday.\n \nSquats\n \nThe squat is another classic lifting exercise that is especially beneficial to the lower body. The exercise directly works the hips and hamstrings. It also indirectly strengthens your core and even your upper body if done with weight. Amateur weightlifters often times focus on their upper body and neglect the lower half. Don't fall for that. Any training regimen should work the entire body and squats are an essential piece. They're that good for you.\n \nDeadlift\n \nThe deadlift builds total-body strength. It's a gimmie for the best-exercise title, but it does come with risks. The wrong technique can injure your back, so it's important to keep it flat throughout the lift. When the deadlift is executed correctly it will strengthen your back as well as your calves, quads, hamstrings, core and forearms.\n \nThe lift is simple and with the proper focus and attention to technique it can be completed without injury. The goal is to pick up a weighted bar off the ground and bring it up to your thighs using your whole body. The completion of the lift will have you standing up, your arms straight with the weight hanging.\n \nThe deadlift is effective at building strength because the inert weight starts on the ground and must be lifted up in a controlled movement. The lifter doesn't have a chance to use any momentum, hence the \"dead\" name.\n \nSource: \nThe 7 Best Exercises for a Full-Body Workout\n \nThe 5 Best Exercises For A Full-Body Workout", "authorship": "human"}

Being British, it was a long, and expensive journey for us but well worth the trip.\n \nWe were in one of the theme parks (I forget which, now) that had a “Jurassic Park” section, as that movie was still the rage since it was made in 1993. Among the rides and other attractions, there was a small path leading down to a sort of “cattle shed”. And in the shed was a full sized triceratops animatronic figure. In those days these robotic figures were nowhere near as common as today, but it was obvious that its movement, though clever, was controlled by some guy hiding behind a screen, moving the beast according to what was happening.\n \nThe two keepers gave us their spiel about how “Gladys” (or whatever her name was, I forget now) was three years old, very tame and so on, inviting kids to stroke its nose (at which it “purred”). They also took its temperature rectally (something it didn't like) and the triceratops groaned and shook it's head in disgust. After that, they told us they had to take a urine sample, and so one of the keepers placed a bucket underneath but the triceratops wouldn't perform. So the other keeper stooped under to see what was wrong, and immediately the guy behind the screen caused the triceratops to let loose a load of water over the keeper, much to the audience’s delight. Everyone roared with laughter.\n \nThis was going on for about 15 minutes. Suddenly, in a loud, serious voice behind us, a huge Texan, complete with the classic drawl, turned to his friend and said:\n \n“Hey, Burt, That's not a \nREAL\n Dah-no-sawr!\n \n“There’s NO way that's real”.\n \n“Ahh paid fifty bucks to come here an’ Ahh thought Ahh was gonna see a REAL Dah-no-sawr.”\n \n“There's NO Way that's real”.\n \nI wonder if he managed to get his money back?", "authorship": "human"}

Most left the state and moved around seeking any job they could find, leaving our state impoverished for young people to keep things going.\n \nThis is the effect of many decades of “trickle down economics”. The name and theory sound good, but in essence it requires pumping all the wealth up the to wealthiest people in the world, who do their best to hoard everything they get, with reasonable success. A bit does trickle back down to the middle classes and even less to the poor, but nothing compared to what the economic and tax policies have taken from us. And the latest tax restructuring policy is “trickle down” on steroids; it will be about 15 times worse for the economy than the current tax policy. I’m glad I never had kids, I will not have to watch them struggle worse than I had to in this wreck of a nation we are leaving to the next generations.

Now in response to the question, ‘Where are you guys from? you’ve got a strange accent’ our response was obviously ‘South Africa, do you know it?’, his prompt response was “Yeah, yeah, my wife … she’s from South Africa”, now naturally this excited me, so I’m like, “Oh, really?”, for him to then say, “Yeah man, you know Egypt right?”\n \nNow at this moment my mate face-palms himself and I just keep quiet and the conversation doesn’t really go anywhere from there.

If you’re trying to put on size, you need to be eating 1g to 1.5 g of protein/per lb of bodyweight (example: 100lb male needs to ingest 100g-150g of protein/daily). I’d try eating 30gr of protein immediately within 30 minutes of waking up (see Tim Ferriss’s 4 hour Body book for more info regarding that.\n \nAlso just challenge yourself in new ways. Try gymnastic moves like handstands, try perfecting a perfect 15 second handstand hold. Or construct your own parrallete bars out of PVC pipes, and practice doing an L-sit hold. These isometric types of exercises are great for the home gym lifter, and will tax you in a ways you’re not used to. Something that is severely overlooked in weightlifting is grip strength.

But that is for people with especially good recovery abilities.\n \nIt amazes me how much the bodybuilding industry has confused the shit out of people. Telling them to workout 6 times per week, eat 2 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight, and other useless nonsense. Sure that works for the guys taking steroids, but all it does for a natural trainer is lead them nowhere. Yeah, you might experience results in a few months, but after that you’ll stagnate.\n \nFull-body workouts on the other hand, are the perfect routines for natural trainers. They offer enough volume, but not too much to where you can’t recover from. In addition, you’re joints and central nervous system get more of a break and time to recover because you’re not training as often.\n \nAll you need in a full-body workout is a major push, a major pull, and a major legs exercise. The intermediate and advance could also benefit from some assistance exercises for the arms and calves. But other than that, this is all you will ever need to grow. I currently am 6′1 and weigh 203 lbs, at 11 percent body fat. And I have been on a maintenance routine only lifting weights twice per week and sprinting on a third day. I haven’t gained any mass (hence the maintenance routine) but I still have continued to gain strength. One of my example workouts was this:\n \nWeighted Dips: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nWeighted Chin-ups: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nSquats: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nCalf raises and forearms: 2–3 sets of 10–15 reps\n \nWill you get to be 250 at 5 % body fat and become some absolute beast?? Hell no, not even close. But no natural trainer will ever get that close. If you are around 6 feet tall, the most you can ever expect to weight at 10 percent body fat is probably 215 to 220. And those numbers are for someone with very great genetics.\n \nI love how people think they need to follow the split routines 6 days per week because everyone else is doing it.\n \nWell, how many people do you see that are big and strong? Not many. How many people do you see at the gym following those splits who are actually big and NOT taking steroids?

There is no magical number of sets. When going for mechanical stress it is possible to achieve the desired effect after only 1 set, just make sure warming up properly. When the muscle tissue is torn and damaged, it will start a regenerating process that rebuilds and reinforces the damaged area. Normally it is ok to perform 2 and even 3 sets of this kind of tissue-breaking training, and 2 exercises will be plenty, making sure to hit the muscle from different angles and causing growth in a large area. \n \nFor the metabolical stress effect you will need more reps and less weights, but again- there is no magical number of exercises. Do as many as you want to, and I recommend you superset them or giantset them, in order to hit the same muscle from many different angles, all in one highrep round of exercises. I like to do 3 exercises on each musclegroup, for 3 rounds of trisets, when doing this kind of training. It can come up to a total of 45 reps on one round, doing 15 reps on 3 exercises with no rest in between, on the same muscle. it will give you the most insane feeling of pump, and surely cause a very good environment for growth.

In my opinion, the best way to train for beginners and intermediates is 3–4 days a week, full-body. I train that way 95% of the time myself and I have been training for 14 years.\n \nNote that this is the current trend in the newest and most cutting edge powerlifting training programs out there, Norwegian and RTS for example.\n \nAdvanced lifters who train 5–7 days a week, sometimes twice a day, may need to split their training up a little. They still squat, press and pull 3–7 days a week.\n \nWhat is the problem with split training routines?\n \nLet’s look at the concept. Basically the idea is that you train a body part, say legs. once a week, completely into the ground, you “destroy”, “demolish”, “annihilate” your legs, then rest for a week.\n \nNow, both research and experience has shown that first, most drug-free trainees cannot recover properly from such an extreme training session and that milder sessions spread out over the week work better and second, that the muscle building period after training in drug-free people is only 1–2 days and that they are then ready to train again.\n \nIn other words, you get much better results, at any stage of advancement, from squatting 3 sets Monday, 3 sets Wednesday and 3 sets Friday, than from squatting 9 sets Monday and resting for a week.\n \nNot only that, but you avoid the crippling soreness that you get from once-a-week training and feel fresher and stronger all the time.\n \nYes, advanced trainees sometimes train for 5–10 sessions a week and then incorporate some sort of split, but they still work each basic movement several times during the week.\n \nWhole-body does not imply that each session needs to be exactly the same. I keep them similar for total beginners. Repetition and practice in the base lifts is crucial. But for intermediates and above it is feasible and useful to vary the sessions, both the set/rep scheme and the exercise.", "authorship": "human"}

Some variation in exercises does help to hit the muscle group from different angles, perhaps work different muscles within the group with different emphasis and so on, but that just means you do a few different versions of each movement over time.\n \nPersonally, I find the basics still work. Squats, presses, deadlifts, rows. My routine is built around that. I do variations like front squats, step-ups, hack squats, sumo and stiff-legged deadlifts, one-arm pulldowns instead of pull-ups sometimes, kettlebell rows or T-bar rows… but the core of the workout remains the same. Of course, I’m at an age and lifestyle where continuous progress is not even the goal - I’m happy to stay at the same weight / shape / strength levels while being able to eat normally and have a few drinks over the course of the week.\n \nApart from anything else, those 4 moves are so fundamental to training that you really need to groove them - and then keep practicing them. So for the first few years of training, always do them. After that, if you want a few different workouts over the course of the week that’s fine, but still squat, row and press at least once a week (deadlifts once a week is fine from the beginning - many people don’t recover fast enough to be able to do more).\n \nSo, find the best moves, keep them at the core of your routine, put in a few variations from time to time and do it for the next few decades… unless you’re entering this year’s Mr. Olympia or World’s Strongest Man in which case you shouldn’t be on this forum for advice.", "authorship": "human"}

So if you had to carry or life a 50 pound object everyday, at first it will be hard, eventually it would get easier until it'll be no effort at all.  But eventually the body will adapt to the point where you need to add more weight if you want to get stronger or bigger. \n \nThat's the principle of overload and profession. \n \nThe principle of specificity basically says, if you want to get good at running, run more. Specify in what you want to achieve in. If you want to be able to life more weight, life more weight. If you want to be a good mountain climber, climb more mountains etc.\n \nSo there you have it. To get stronger you need to do more. Stress the body more. \n \nLook into nutrition. Much of \"reaping the benefits\" of training occur in the kitchen. Consume healthy fats and proteins. Limit carbs but keep in mind that carbs are needed for insulin which help stimulate muscle growth. \n \nAlso if you ever do get back into the gym. \n1-5 reps = strength 7-10 = mass 11+ = endurance \n \nAs for now, purchase some body weights and train with those. Doing pull-ups with an extra twenty pound weight on your chest is hard! Good luck.", "authorship": "human"}

After a game, I strode confidently into the Kansas City Royals’ weight room, rested the weight bar on my shoulders and settled in for some heavy squats.  I rocked my hips back and dropped into my form, feeling totally in control. On the way back up, I got stuck. I leaned forward and the bar spilled over my neck. More than 500 pounds went violently crashing to the floor and members of both teams turned to look.\n \nLuckily, nothing was injured that day other than my pride.  It could have been much worse.  I was over-trained; I had an intense weight training session the day before and was just coming off playing nine innings.  “More is better” was my mantra, but I was naïve.\n \nAt 23, I lifted heavy weights every day. Now, I lift three days a week. I’m not quite as strong, but I’m inching closer to that 500 pound threshold now that I understand the importance of rest and recovery.  If I understood how the body repairs itself when I was a rookie, I would have been stronger, healthier, and a better baseball player.\n \nIt’s essential to incorporate recovery days into your program so your muscles can adequately repair themselves, grow and become stronger. When we train with weights, we actually create small tears in our muscle fibers. Those fibers then repair and rebuild bigger and stronger while we rest.  If you don’t build in that downtime, you break the muscle fibers down further reducing the chance for solid growth and increasing the risk of injury.\n \nIf your ultimate goal is size and strength, avoid weight training, even targeting separate muscle groups, on consecutive days.\n \nYour body only builds muscle when you are not weight training.  Trust the process, believe in the value of rest, and you’ll be significantly stronger as a result.", "authorship": "human"}

The compound exercises allow one to train the entire body using just a few exercises (squats, deadlifts, presses, rows, power cleans) and the training session will be short (under 45 minutes) which will allow proper recovery and avoid overtraining. I think that training the entire body with single set, isolation exercises would take too long and would impair proper recovery.\n \nBUT, I do think that single set, isolation exercises can be effective if used to build up a lagging bodypart, like biceps or calves, and the rest of the body is trained with compound exercises.", "authorship": "human"}

Body-weight squats are fantastic; aim for 3 sets of 15-20 reps. Throw in some lunges (forward or reverse) with 3 sets of 10 reps for each leg. Want to activate those glutes? Try glute bridges or hip thrusts, doing 3 sets of 15-20 reps.\n \nLet's give some love to your core muscles.

I ignored completely the common rest one day rule and all that is written and just listen to my body and curiously I found that the body is indeed capable of taking well care of itself and is asking me literally for being used and pushed to its limits daily, that’s why I didn’t yet miss a single day of exercising at least once daily since then.", "authorship": "human"}

I feel the mind-muscle connection can be established in a bro-split routine better than a full body, strength focused routine.\n \nIn my opinion, there are just way too many variables in a bro-split routine to manage, track, and progress. It also requires way too training days to be effective. I would always recommend a well structured, well periodized full body routine to a beginner-intermediate lifter who seeks strength and muscle gains. It usually takes 3–4 training days a week to make excellent progress.\n \nIf you don’t mind spending some money, I would recommend \nBarbell Medicine\n; they have excellent training templates for pretty much any goals that you have.

But the best was a family called the Canterburys who lived between us and Joe.\n \nThe Canterbury family consisted of a woman and her two teenage daughters. I think there was a father somewhere but we never saw him so he was either permanently drunk/stoned in their apartment or in jail. During our time there Mrs C and her daughters came up with a dazzling array of dumb questions, such as:\n \n * Aw, you from Inglund! Did you drive here?\n * Say, can you cycle to Paris from your house in England?\n \nAnd my personal favourite:\n \n * Do you guys speak English in England?\n \nBut our experience was entirely benign compared to that of Keith, one of my other roommates.

At least 5. There has to be a warmup for each exercise which means a lot of time spent doing warm-up sets. Advanced athletes will also need to include many isolation exercises.\n \n3: Even after warm-up, it takes at least 2 sets to get a grasp of the technique and make the most out of an exercise. A higher frequency training means a lower number of sets per session which won’t allow performing more than 2–3 sets for an exercise. This is why advanced athletes train with a lower frequency, less number of exercises, and a higher number of sets per session. Less warmup and more exercise.\n \n4: Too much fatigue will accumulate due to training every single day. This might not be a concern for beginners but it will affect advanced athletes. It's better to train full body 3–6 times per week and adjust rest days accordingly.\n \nFull-body workouts are undoubtedly effective but doing them every single day is not.\n \nSubscribe to \nBrawny King Fitness\n for legit fitness videos.", "authorship": "human"}

So basically we know what we want to know and disregard what we are uncomfortable with to the wind. This is an issue about geography as well. Most Americans only know what they want to know, or what we are told through biased media. “Iran is evil, and is part of ISIS” or “Turkey is not a country it is food” or “Only good middle east country is Israel.” This one is one of my favorites because it comes from two places, the religious community (In my opinion the most hard headed and ignorant group in this country) believes Israel is a chosen people of God because of the Bible, and the money men in the country put this out so the Jewish Americans will stay happy and bring more fiscal interests.\n \nIn short many Americans don’t try to gain knowledge, most of there knowledge is simply to reinforce already held bias and prejudices.

She came up to us and asked us if we liked Donald Trump, because she was his big fan. Both of us said no, so she started explaining why she liked Republicans. One of her reasons was because she believed that women should be at home taking care of children. That made my friend laugh out loud, because she is a woman with big ambitions and goals. This led to a conversation about school and our majors. I was a pharmacy major and my friend medical. Once the girl heard medical, she told us that she wanted to be a doctor too, but she changed her major to business. She asked my friend if classes required for meds school were hard and explained that she was not very good at math, biology and chemistry. So we told her that those classes are pretty much core classes and if she wanted to pursue that career she should get used to it. After that she asked us which high school did we attend. I told her that I was not from here, so when I told her Czech Republic, she asked me if this was a city in Brazil. I am cool with people telling me Asia (because I’m of Asian descent), but I just replied with no it’s in Europe. So she said: “oh!! Yes! That’s a beautiful country in Africa, right?” At this point, I was just speechless. The girl must’ve noticed my facial expression because after that she told us that she was never good at geography. My friend was literally laughing her ass off and told her that Europe was a continent.\n \nI’ve heard a lot of crap, but that day.. I will remember for the rest of my life.", "authorship": "human"}

This can help you use the data to recognize patterns. If you were unable to exercise for a day or two, write down your reasons.\nBuild muscle mass by simultaneously doing fewer repetitions. Start by choosing a muscle group like the chest. Start with weights that are lighter weight to warm up your muscles.\nIt is a good idea to do approximately 15-20 reps with the warm-up weights. The second set should involve weights for which you can complete only able to do 6-8 reps. Add five more pounds of weight and repeat the third set.\nRunning outside setting is better for you to get on a treadmill. Running on paved surfaces is better in the winter than a treadmill.\nWhen doing repetitious types of exercises that you need to count, you should count down instead of up. This keeps you an idea of just how many exercises you still have left and help keep your motivation level up.\nYou can boost your workouts by controlling your breathing properly. Try forcefully exhaling when your shoulders peak during situps. Deep breathing causes your ab muscles to work than normal.\nTest out a bench before you use it for a workout. Press a finger into the padding and whether or not it can hold your weight.\nBEST of LUCK", "authorship": "human"}

Of course we're Canandian! and laughed awkwardly. The woman says to us 'But you sound American..where are your accents?'\n \nFirst of all, very rarely will you meet someone with a 'Canadian' accent. The 'accent' most Americans refer to stem from the Maritimes (Atlantic provinces) and even then, many do not have an accent. We are a bilingual country so some residents of Quebec and northern Ontario will have a slight 'Quebecois' accent (similar to a French accent, but distinctly different). Not all Canadians end their sentences in 'eh' and we don't all sound like we were born and raised in some small town in the Atlantic.\n \nSecondly, the American accent can be from the deep South, or unique like Minnesota and Boston. Even the Southern accent differs from state to state (I have a hard time understanding anyone from small town West Virginia). So I was really confused as to what American accent she thought we would have since your accents differs from region to region.\n \nThirdly, I'm a Toronto native. Toronto — a melting pot of cultures. Toronto — one of the most diverse cities in this country. Toronto — where we don't have a specific accent because our city speaks about 100 different languages.", "authorship": "human"}

I know nowadays it's not a big deal but when he was playing it certainly was, either way it cost him a hundred million just because he needed weed. There are plenty of other dumbbells out there, I just haven't met them like George W Bush and Johnny Manziel another football player who had the world at his fingertips but wanted to be a drunk and couldn't keep out of trouble and threw it all away.

My parents are farmers, and most of my happiest moments are the moments that I spent time with my family.\n \nI am from a completely rural village, I have a joint family with my parents, an elder brother, two sisters and their husbands, four nephews, and a niece.

They openly say this in their seminaries when men interested in becoming pastors (it’s never a woman) study the history of the denomination—which I can respect them for admitting. But these are the people who want to determine how teachers address slavery.

I stopped at a self serve gas station in a small town in Oregon state, to top up my tank. A young man about thirty something came up to me and I handed him Eighty Canadian dollars, The sale was Sixty four dollars. The man looked at me and said, “sorry, we don’t take foreign currencies”. He then looked at my car and asked me where Vancouver was, after seeing the licence plate. I offered my bank’s debit card, but that of course, was also a foreign product. I enquired whether he had just moved to Oregon and he said yes, but I grew up in Washington State.\n \nWashington State is the one next to Vancouver, and it’s between Vancouver and Oregon. Yet, he never heard of a place called Vancouver. Any way, it was too early to get cash at the nearby bank, and could not get access to an ATM machine, so I asked him to take back his gas by syphoning it. Suddenly, another customer came in and he tried to explain that Canada is ALMOST like part of the USA , but the man was not convinced. The new customer asked whether I was on my way to Vancouver, and I replied “No, I was heading to Reno. “ He gave the gas attendant Sixty four dollars, then turned to me with a big smile and said, “see you 3.00pm at the Circus-circus Casino, partner. At 3.00 PM, I met Jim in the Casino, and handed him Sixty four dollars (in US currency) After (31) thirty one years Jim and I still meet up when I visit or pass through Oregon State.", "authorship": "human"}

If you exercise late in the night and don't follow that with food, then that highly beneficial period is likely to be wasted.\n \nThat being said, if you can't consistently exercise in the morning, then evening exercise is a good way to go. It would be far more beneficial to consistently exercise in the evening than to do just 1-2 days in the morning and then let go of it.", "authorship": "human"}

These days, I came to know how hard my father works daily to lead our family. He always tries his best to provide us with all we want. I am happy to say that I am blessed with lovable parents and supportive sibling. I feel rich to have them.\n \nI am going to enter into the final year of my bachelors very soon.

Do 2 pull-ups and rest for 30–60 seconds and repeat until you get to the desired number.\n \nOnce you start getting into the 30 rep per exercise area change up the exercises and start back at 10.\n \nThese three exercises are a good place to get started when doing a workout at home. They work most of the primary muscle groups and will give you a good base strength.\n \nHere is an article that goes more in-depth :)\n \nhttps://www.t-nation.com/training/plp-the-60-day-challenge", "authorship": "human"}

He told me him and his buddies at the factory had a good laugh thinking about this “stupid n****r” feeding his family horse and thinking it was moose. This bastard clearly thought that I would think this was funny. We don’t tend to talk about people that way in Canada. I mean, I have never heard anything like that before. I know there are terrible people everywhere in the world, but this kind of casual racism and disregard for a man and his family was new to me. I don’t believe that all Americans are like that, nor do I believe that all Canadian or English people are good people, but the question was “who is the most ignorant American you have met” and that guy, my friend, was the one!", "authorship": "human"}

When loaded and done properly, the squat will have positive effects on your quads, glutes, hams, abs, low back, lats, and upper back, as well as increasing stability and proper movement patterns in the knees, ankles and hips. Also who doesn't want a nice set of glutes?\nDeadlift: You're literally picking something up off the ground. Again, not something you don't want to not be able to do. Deadlifts work all the muscles worked in the squat with more of an emphasis on the back muscles, plus traps and rotator cuff muscles. Get a good deadlift and reduce chances of random back injuries. \nBent Row: Many people have given an answer as a pressing movement. Although they do build a nice chest/shoulders, you're never really going to need to do a strict press in every day movements. Not only will the bent row improve your posture, but will also heavily tax your lats, low back, and abs. \nI've chosen these three because they're, in my opinion, the more important of the primal movement patterns to be done correctly. You will \nnot\n be able to build a well rounded, show ready physique, but you can become much, much stronger in every day life and while doing the majority of every day tasks.", "authorship": "human"}

Increasing the fiber will not only clean you out, but it will lower your cholesterol, lower your blood sugar, normalize your blood pressure and will give you more of a full feeling at meal time which will allow you to eat less, thus creating healthy weight loss.

Focus on compound movements for your legs, back, shoulders, chest and hinge movements:\n \nSo one day could be leg press, pull-ups, dumbbell overhead press, bench press and straight leg deadlifts - another could be squats, dumbbell rows, dips, dumbbell incline bench press, good mornings.\n \nExercise choice is up to you, but concentrate on those five areas and compound movements as they recruit the most muscle fibres. Use free weights, not machines, because machines will not give you nearly enough stress on the muscle to make significant changes. Bodyweight moves could be used instead if you are not comfortable using weights to begin wuth.\n \nCardio will be important too. Best bet is high intensity interval training (HIIT), which could be done on days you are not in the gym.\n \nHope that helps.", "authorship": "human"}

In the summer of 2023, I attended their national conference and there were several meetings discussing voting security. All panels for sessions are evenly divided between Red and Blue participants.\n \nAt one of these sessions, Republican efforts to suppress voting were mentioned. A young man on the Red side of the panel literally waved his hand and said, “This is the US. Anyone who wants to vote has been able to vote for the last 200 years.” All you had to do to make that statement was to ignore the fact that women and Black people, who made up the majority of people in the US, had NOT been able to vote for much of US history.\n \nTo make it even worse, only a few minutes earlier an older Republican on the panel had described his trips to the South to register Black voters in the early 1960s. He had described how Black people were afraid to be seen even speaking to him during that time because their houses could be burned down.\n \nUnfortunately, the audience wasn’t allowed to speak up during this session. I should have ignored that and stood up to point out the obvious fallacy the young man had uttered.", "authorship": "human"}

A longer gap between the last meal and the workout, combined with more available oxygen if the workout is in a ventilated area or outdoors all help burn calories. It's also useful in pumping freshly oxygenated blood to the brain, first thing in the morning and in getting the fitness objective ticked on your checklist.\n \nAn evening workout is useful to build on a somewhat warmed up body and to remove the stress of the day's routine. It takes a different meal time adjustment from the person going for a morning workout. The cool down phase of the workout needs to be longer/slower in an evening workout since the air temperature tends to cool the body faster. (Not applicable if one works out in an air conditioned gym.) This is also useful for those whose routines involve late nights.\n \nAs an aside, the key to waking early is to eat 2 hours or more before hitting bed. Sleeping on a full stomach tends to restrict proper digestion and affects oxidation (burning) of food. This causes reduced oxygen in the blood and the brain suffers from grogginess by the morning.", "authorship": "human"}

Also training this longer leads to central nervous system fatigue, which affects the intensity of training and intensity is one of the major contributors to hypertrophy. Also training muscle groups like triceps with the same intensity after doing bench press is difficult because intensity is compromised due to the onset of peripheral fatigue at this point. So, my advice to you- follow full body workouts only in cases you want to build foundational strength as in beginners.

Especially if you are working out the right way meaning intensity and form wise.\n \nWith that being said, you should be resting after a good full body workout. Growth happens from tearing things down and allowing them to rebuild back up. If you go back the day after and tear everything down again before it’s had a chance to heal and build up, what results will come out of this? No to much.\n \nActive recovery is always good. Breaking a light sweat while getting the body to move promotes blood flow. Blood contains the minerals and nutrients needed to heal.\n \nAs others have mentioned, yoga, power walking, stretching, foam rolling, light biking, playing football or Frisbee with your kids if you have any, etc.", "authorship": "human"}

Working out then might be a bit too painful, you might not squeeze out much juice, you might not want to go to the gym.\n \nBut for intermediate training and above (i.e. when you don't get super sore and you won't hurt yourself doing a high-frequency program), you can experiment with increasing frequency per muscle group and seeing if you're one of the higher responders. I think this school of thought is becoming more popular in contrast to many bro-split programs.", "authorship": "human"}

Just running will build up a certain kind of endurance and stamina but so will weight training. A mix of both is probably best.", "authorship": "human"}
